If you are on social media, you are in marketing. And that means that we are all relying on our words to carry our marketing messages. We are all writers.\n\nYeah, but who cares about writing anymore? In a time-challenged world dominated by short and snappy, by click-bait headlines and Twitter streams and Instagram feeds and gifs and video and Snapchat and YOLO and LOL and #tbt. . . does the idea of focusing on writing seem pedantic and ordinary?\n\nActually, writing matters more now, not less. Our online words are our currency; they tell our customers who we are.\n\nOur writing can make us look smart or it can make us look stupid. It can make us seem fun, or warm, or competent, or trustworthy. But it can also make us seem humdrum or discombobulated or flat-out boring.\n\nThat means you've got to choose words well, and write with economy and the style and honest empathy for your customers. And it means you put a new value on an often-overlooked skill in content marketing: How to write, and how to tell a true story really, really well. That's true whether you're writing a listicle or the words on a Slideshare deck or the words you're reading right here, right now...\n\nAnd so being able to communicate well in writing isn't just nice; it's necessity.

Ann deconstructs the strategy and delivers a practical approach to create ridiculously compelling and competent content. It's designed to be the go-to guide for anyone creating or publishing any kind of online content — whether you're a big brand or you're small and solo.\n\nSections include:\n\nHow to write better. (Or, for \"adult-onset writers\": How to hate writing less.)\n\nEasy grammar and usage rules tailored for business in a fun, memorable way.

Ten years later, and against all odds, this upstart autonomous decentralized software offers an unstoppable and globally-accessible hard money alternative to modern central banks. The Bitcoin Standard analyzes the historical context to the rise of Bitcoin, the economic properties that have allowed it to grow quickly, and its likely economic, political, and social implications.\n\nWhile Bitcoin is a new invention of the digital age, the problem it purports to solve is as old as human society itself: transferring value across time and space. Ammous takes the reader on an engaging journey through the history of technologies performing the functions of money, from primitive systems of trading limestones and seashells, to metals, coins, the gold standard, and modern government debt. Exploring what gave these technologies their monetary role, and how most lost it, provides the reader with a good idea of what makes for sound money, and sets the stage for an economic discussion of its consequences for individual and societal future-orientation, capital accumulation, trade, peace, culture, and art. Compellingly, Ammous shows that it is no coincidence that the loftiest achievements of humanity have come in societies enjoying the benefits of sound monetary regimes, nor is it coincidental that monetary collapse has usually accompanied civilizational collapse.\n\nWith this background in place, the book moves on to explain the operation of Bitcoin in a functional and intuitive way. Bitcoin is a decentralized, distributed piece of software that converts electricity and processing power into indisputably accurate records, thus allowing its users to utilize the Internet to perform the traditional functions of money without having to rely on, or trust, any authorities or infrastructure in the physical world. Bitcoin is thus best understood as the first successfully implemented form of digital cash and digital hard money. With an automated and perfectly predictable monetary policy, and the ability to perform final settlement of large sums across the world in a matter of minutes, Bitcoin’s real competitive edge might just be as a store of value and network for final settlement of large payments—a digital form of gold with a built-in settlement infrastructure.\n\nAmmous’ firm grasp of the technological possibilities as well as the historical realities of monetary evolution provides for a fascinating exploration of the ramifications of voluntary free market money. As it challenges the most sacred of government monopolies, Bitcoin shifts the pendulum of sovereignty away from governments in favor of individuals, offering us the tantalizing possibility of a world where money is fully extricated from politics and unrestrained by borders.\n\nThe final chapter of the book explores some of the most common questions surrounding Bitcoin: Is Bitcoin mining a waste of energy? Is Bitcoin for criminals? Who controls Bitcoin, and can they change it if they please? How can Bitcoin be killed? And what to make of all the thousands of Bitcoin knock-offs, and the many supposed applications of Bitcoin’s ‘blockchain technology’?

Different cultures teach different values and we carry those values throughout adulthood and into the office environment. Understanding the cultural and gender viewpoints of our colleagues is a major key to healthy, conflict-free work environments.\n\nThis fable takes its name from a Chinese children's parable about how \"the loudest duck gets shot.\" It's a parable that contrasts with the American idiom \"the squeaky wheel gets the grease.\" Comparing the two, it's clear that different cultures teach different views, and those views often translate into distinct ways of doing business. In today's global business world, understanding each other-where we come from and what we're taught-is more important than ever.\n\nA business fable that points out how the old way of approaching diversity will never work, showing us how to understand and navigate the cultural and gender differences that cause conflict in the office\n\nPerfect for managers and executives faced with leadership challenges in a heterogeneous workforce and who want to make sure their organization is a true meritocracy and a level playing field for everyone\n\nIdeal for anyone, at any level, who wants more tools in their toolbox to get ahead in business in a global business culture\n\nDoing business today takes understanding and cultural intelligence. The Loudest Duck uses an entertaining story to share important lessons about why diversity efforts are bound to fail unless we really understand how we unconsciously respond to difference and how to move to beyond it.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Culture in Business"]},{"id":"9781000985085","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Script Analysis for Actors, Directors, and Designers, 7th Edition","authors":["James Thomas"],"pages":"246","publication_date":"November 2023","description":"Script Analysis for Actors, Directors, and Designers, Seventh Edition, teaches the skills of script analysis using a formalist approach that examines the written part of a play to evaluate its potentials for performance and production.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Communication","Creative Writing"]},{"id":"9780471751212","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Damodaran on Valuation","authors":["Aswath Damodaran"],"pages":"696","publication_date":"August 2006","description":"\"Aswath Damodaran is simply the best valuation teacher around.

In addition, the relevant parts of the codes of the AMMs are shown after explaining each formula sothat the actual implementation of the formulae can be seen.\nIn a traditional trading market a buy order has to be matched with a sell order to achieve a trade. However, for an AMM, users trade against the protocol itself, a smart contract, or a community pool of funds.

Supplier Relationship Management: How to Maximize Vendor Value and Opportunity changes all that. Containing the best and most innovative advice from the operations and procurement experts at consultant AT Kearney, this book shows that SRM is at root a strategic discussion requiring cross-functional interaction and internal alignment at the highest levels. It requires an honest appraisal of the value that suppliers now bring to your firm, as well as their potential value.

The crisis arose because a lot of highly educated people in high-impact positions— political power brokers, business leaders, and large segments of the general public—made a lot of bad decisions despite unprecedented access to data, highly sophisticated decision support systems, methodological advances in the decision sciences, and guidance from highly experienced experts. How could we get things so wrong? The answer, says J. Davidson Frame in Framing Decisions: Decision Making That Accounts for Irrationality, People, and Constraints, is that traditional processes do not account for the three critical immeasurable elements highlighted in the book's subtitle— irrationality, people, and constraints.\n\nFrame argues that decision-makers need to move beyond their single-minded focus on rational and optimal solutions as preached by the traditional paradigm. They must accommodate a decision's social space and address the realities of dissimulation, incompetence, legacy, greed, peer pressure, and conflict. In the final analysis, when making decisions of consequence, they should focus on people – both as individuals and in groups.\n\nFraming Decisions offers a new approach to decision making that gets decision-makers to put people and social context at the heart of the decision process.

The Cucumber for Java Book has the same great advice about how to deliver rock-solid applications collaboratively, but with all code completely rewritten in Java. New chapters cover features unique to the Java version of Cucumber, and reflect insights from the Cucumber team since the original book was published.\n\nUntil now it's been difficult for teams developing Java applications to learn how to benefit from Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD). This book changes all that by describing in detail how to use Cucumber to harness the power of plain language specifications in your development process.\n\nIn part 1, you'll discover how to use Cucumber's Gherkin DSL to describe the behavior your customers want from the system. You'll also learn how to write Java code that interprets those plain language specifications and checks them against your application. Part 2 guides you through a worked example, using Spring, MySQL, and Jetty. Enhanced chapters teach you how to use Selenium to drive your application and handle asynchronous Ajax calls, and new chapters cover Dependency Injection (DI) and advanced techniques to help keep your test suites fast. Part 3 shows you how to integrate Cucumber with your Continuous Integration (CI) system, work with a REST web service, and even use BDD with legacy applications.\n\nWritten by the creator of Cucumber and two of its most experienced users and contributors, The Cucumber for Java Book is an authoritative guide that will give you and your team all the knowledge you need to start using Cucumber with confidence.","tags":["Software Development","QA / Testing","Cucumber"]},{"id":"9780133092844","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"30 Days to Better Thinking and Better Living Through Critical Thinking: A Guide for Improving Every Aspect of Your Life, Revised and Expanded","authors":["Dr. Linda Elder","Dr. Richard Paul"],"pages":"240","publication_date":"September 2012","description":"Better critical thinking can transform your life and help you improve every decision you make!

Three McKinsey senior partners offer strategies for overcoming it and fulfilling your potential.\n\nWomen around the world do extremely well when it comes to their education. They graduate at higher rates than men and have higher average GPAs. But then a strange thing happens: upon entering the workforce, they immediately lose their advantage. When the first promotions come around, the slide continues. For every 100 men promoted to manager, only 81 women overall and 77 women of color get promoted.\n\nThis is what McKinsey senior partners Kweilin Ellingrud, Lareina Yee, and María del Mar Martínez call \"the broken rung,\" and its effects compound throughout women's careers, causing them to fall behind at the start and keeping them from catching up. In this groundbreaking book, the authors reveal the problem's underlying cause: while about half of a person's lifetime earnings come from education and half from work experience, men get more value from their experience than women do. It is also here, in one's work experience, that the solution lies: women need to build their \"experience capital\" to level the playing field and maximize their earning potential.\n\nThe book combines over a decade of research, personal conversations with more than fifty remarkable leaders, and the authors' own rich experiences as leaders at McKinsey.

The second edition has been revised and updated throughout, with an expanded section on how leaders can identify their own intrinsic rewards and new tools, tips and practices for encouraging intrinsic motivation in others.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Culture in Business"]},{"id":"9781907312472","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Out of Our Minds: Learning to be Creative, Fully Revised and Updated Edition","authors":["Sir Ken Robinson"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"March 2011","description":"\"It is often said that education and training are the keys to the future.They are, but a key can be turned in two directions.

Clarke"],"pages":"212","publication_date":"January 2009","description":"Grantwriters often have little or no training in the practical task of grantseeking. Many feel intimidated by the act of writing, and some don't enjoy writing. In Storytelling for Grantseekers, Second Edition, Cheryl Clarke presents an organic approach to grantseeking, one that views the process through the lens of the pleasures and rewards of crafting a good story. Grantseekers who approach the process as one in which they are connecting with an audience (grantmakers) and writing a narrative (complete with settings, characters, antagonists and resolutions) find greater success with funders. The writing process becomes a rewarding way to tell the organization's tale, rather than a chore, and their passion and creativity lead to winning proposals.\n\nThis book walks readers through all the main phases of the proposal, highlighting the creative elements that link components to each other and unify the entire proposal. The book contains resources on crafting an effective synopsis, overcoming grantwriter's block, packaging the story, and the best ways to approach the \"short stories\" (inquiry and cover letters) that support the larger proposal.\n\nClarke also stresses the need to see proposal-writing as part of a larger grantseeking effort, one that emphasizes preparation, working with the entire development staff, and maintaining good relations with funders. In Storytelling for Grantseekers, new and experienced grantseekers alike will discover how to write and support successful proposals with humor and passion.\n\nNew edition features:\n\nOverall updates as well as both refreshed and new examples\nWorkshop exercises for using the storytelling approach\nNew chapters on the application of the storytelling method to other fundraising communications like appeal letters and case statements, as well as the importance of site visits\nExample of a full narrative proposal","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Communication","Creative Writing"]},{"id":"9781484210888","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"The Introverted Presenter: Ten Steps for Preparing and Delivering Successful Presentations","authors":["Richard Tierney"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"March 2015","description":"The introvert is a personality type that draws energy from the outside inward. According to standard personality testing assessments, most people are introverts and no group is more introverted than technical professionals. Introverts are congenitally programmed to recoil from the prospect of public speaking with fear and loathing, yet making presentations to expert and non-expert audiences is an inescapable requirement for career advancement in any technical field. Presentation coach Richard Tierney rides to the rescue of fellow introverts in the IT and engineering sectors with The Introverted Presenter—his fail-safe guide to delivering competent presentations, no matter how unsuited by nature you might be to the performing arts.\n\nThis short book lays out the complete process guaranteed to raise you from a debilitating state of terror and aversion to a comfortable place of clarity, calm, and competence—perhaps even brilliance, if you can train yourself to convert the free energy of your fear into controlled performance. Tierney repeatedly warns his introvert readers that they risk presentation fiasco if they skip, skimp, or change the order of any of the ten steps he prescribes for thoroughly and efficiently preparing their presentations.\n\nThe surefire sequence of steps for The Introverted Presenter begins with defining your presentation’s audience and objective. The next step is to write the script of your speech in stages, constructing it on the basis of proven structural rules, cognitive laws, and dramatic tricks. Then you incrementally refine and tighten your script by delivering it iteratively, first in front of a mirror and then in front of increasingly critical test audiences, progressing from your cat to your boss. When you have a well-constructed and sound-tested script in hand and only then, you may create some slides to graft into your script in support of your opening action call and your concluding takeaways, which you commit to memory. Your slides should be limited to the smallest number possible (even zero) and the fewest possible words.","tags":["Business","Project & Product Management","Product Management","Customer Experience"]},{"id":"53863MIT66223","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Liberals Versus Conservatives in Your Office: How to Cool Tensions","authors":["Robert D.

The book combines engaging anecdotes with industry research to illustrate the principles and methods of this complex strategy, and explains the reasoning behind seemingly incomprehensible activist maneuvers.

This book points out the many ways, some quite subtle and deceptive, that this mindset invites tension and conflict. But incredible things happen when people switch to an outward mindset. They intuitively understand what coworkers, colleagues, family, and friends need to be successful and happy. Their organizations thrive, and astonishingly, by focusing on others they become happier and more successful themselves! This new mindset brings about deep and far-reaching changes. The Outward Mindset presents compelling true stories to illustrate the gaps that individuals and organizations typically experience between their actual inward mindsets and their needed outward mindsets. And it provides simple yet profound guidance and tools to help bridge this mindset gap. This new edition includes a new preface, updated case studies, and new material covering Arbinger's latest research on mindsets. In the long run, changing negative behavior without changing one's mindset doesn't last—the old behaviors always reassert themselves. But changing the mindset that causes the behavior changes everything.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Development","Critical Thinking"]},{"id":"9781394252206","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Five Generations at Work","authors":["Rebecca Robins","Patrick Dunne"],"pages":"272","publication_date":"September 2024","description":"The definitive playbook for empowering intergenerational collaboration, innovation and productivity at work.\n\nFive Generations at Work: How we win together, for good explores how to maximise the dynamics of our generational diversity to create more collaborative and competitive organisations.

Dig deep into CSS fundamentals and learn how to use the available selectors to build powerful rules.\n\nYou will learn how to use cascading, inheritance, pseudo-classes, pre-processors, and components to produce cleaner, DRY-er style sheets, and how to let these features work for you instead of leading you down the road of rule duplication and design inconsistencies.

Yet companies continue to struggle with toxic cultures, and the low productivity and unhappiness that go with them.\n\nWhy is “culture” so difficult to improve? What makes so many good employees check out? Neuroscientist Paul Zak shows that innate brain functions hold the answers. It all boils down to trust.\n\nWhen someone shows you trust, a feel-good jolt of oxytocin surges through your brain and triggers you to reciprocate. This simple mechanism creates a perpetual trust-building cycle—the key to changing stubborn workplace patterns.\n\nDrawing on his original research, Zak teases out science-backed insights for building high-trust organizations. Trust Factor opens a window on how brain chemicals affect behavior, why trust gets squashed, and ways to consciously stimulate it by celebrating effort, sharing information, promoting ownership, and more. The Ofactor™ survey, data, and examples support the action plans.\n\nEngagement programs and monetary rewards are Band-Aids on broken bones. To get to the root of the problem, you’ve got to go deeper.

Starting from a teaching and learning perspective, Hunt draws together ideas from psychodynamic psychotherapy, literary and learning theory, and work in the cognitive and neurosciences of the self and consciousness, to argue that creative life writing undertaken in a supportive learning environment, alongside opportunities for critical reflection, has the power to transform the way people think and learn. It does this by opening them up to a more embodied self-experience, which increases their awareness of the source of their thinking in bodily feeling and enables them to develop a more reflexive approach to learning.\n\nHunt locates this work within recent developments in the influential field of transformative learning. She also identifies it as a form of therapeutic education arguing, contrary to those who say that this approach leads to a diminished sense of self, that it can help people to develop a stronger sense of agency, whether for writing or learning or relations with others. Topics covered include:\n\n　\n\nCreative writing as a tool for personal and professional development\n\nThe transformative benefits and challenges of creative writing as a therapeutic activity\n\nThe relationships between literary structures and the processes of thinking and feeling\n\nThe role of cognitive-emotional learning in adult education\n\nCollaborative learning and the role of the group\n\n　\n\nThis book will interest teachers in adult, further and higher education who wish to use creative life writing as a tool for learning, as well as health care professionals seeking art-based techniques for use in their practice. It will also prove useful to academics interested in the relationship between education and psychotherapy, and in the theory and practice of transformative learning. Additionally, it will appeal to writers seeking a deeper understanding of the creative process.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Communication","Creative Writing"]},{"id":"9781838986094","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Salesforce for Beginners","authors":["Sharif Shaalan"],"pages":"472","publication_date":"May 2020","description":"This book serves as an accessible entry point for those new to Salesforce and looking to leverage its capabilities effectively.

But there are very few books that provide clear how-to information that can actually help you think better.\n\nThink Better is about Productive Thinking — why it’s important, how it works, and how to use it at work, at home, and at play. Productive Thinking is a game changer — a practical, easy-to-learn, repeatable process that helps people understand more clearly, think more creatively, and plan more effectively. It's based on the thinking strategies that people we celebrate for their creativity have been using for centuries. Tim Hurson brings Productive Thinking out of the closet and presents it in a way that makes it easy for anyone to grasp and use — so you can think better, work better, and do better in every aspect of your life.\n\nThink Better demonstrates how you can start with an intractable technical problem, an unmet consumer need, or a gaping chasm in your business strategy and, by following a clearly defined, practical thinking process, arrive at a robust, innovative solution. Many companies use the Productive Thinking model to generate fresh solutions for tough business problems, and many individuals rely on it to solve pressing personal problems.\n\nThe principles you'll find in Think Better are straight-forward: separate your thinking into creative thinking and critical thinking; stay with the question; strive for the “third third” by generating lots and lots of ideas; and look for unexpected connections.\n\nThe model consists of six interlocking steps:\n\nStep 1:What's Going On? Explore and truly understand the challenge.\n\nStep 2: What's Success? Envision the ideal outcome and establish success criteria.\n\nStep 3: What's the Question? Pinpoint the real problem or opportunity.\n\nStep 4: Generate Answers List many possible solutions.\n\nStep 5: Forge the Solution Decide which solution is best. Then make it better.\n\nStep 6: Align Resources Create an action plan.\n\nTim Hurson starts by explaining how we all build inner barriers to effective thinking. He identifies our habits of thinking that severely limit our behavior, from “monkey mind” to “gator brain.” Then he demonstrates how to overcome these barriers.\n\nMore than anything, productive thinking is an attitude that will let you look at problems and convert them into opportunities. At the end of this disciplined brainstorming process, you'll have a concrete action plan, complete with timelines and deadlines.\n\nThe book is filled with many of Hurson's original brainstorming tools that will empower you to generate, organize, and process ideas. For example, you can identify your best ideas using the five C's: Cull, Cluster, Combine, Clarify and Choose. And you can transform an embryonic idea into a robust solution with POWER, which stands for Positives, Objections, What else?, Enhancements and Remedies.\n\nTo create the future, you first must be able to imagine it. Productive thinking is a way to help you do that.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Development","Critical Thinking"]},{"id":"9781849681100","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Microsoft Dynamics Sure Step 2010","authors":["Chandru Shankar","Vincent Bellefroid"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"January 2011","description":"Microsoft Dynamics Sure Step 2010 is an essential guide for successfully implementing Microsoft Dynamics business solutions.

Chances are they were created by organizations where colleagues self-allocate into teams based on intrinsic motivation. Where individuals self-manage their commitments to each other without the coercion of managers. And where teams launch new products and ventures on the market without the control of leaders.These organizations represent a new, radically collaborative breed of corporation. Recently doubling in number and already comprising 8% of corporations around the world, scientists and researchers have discovered that radically collaborative organizations are more competitive on practically every meaningful financial measure. They enjoy higher market share, higher innovation, and higher customer satisfaction than their traditional corporate competitors—and they also enjoy higher engagement, loyalty, and motivation from their employees.In this groundbreaking book, technology thought leader and organizational architect Matt K. Parker breaks down the counterintuitive principles and practices that radically collaborative organizations thrive on. By combining the latest insights from organizational science, sociology, and psychology, he illuminates four imperatives that all radically collaborative organizations must embrace in order to succeed: team autonomy, managerial devolution, deficiency gratification, and candid vulnerability.Millions of workers around the world are collapsing under the weight of command-and-control culture.

You will look at types and variables, and get to know the significance of collections and arrays in Dart. Once you've familiarized yourself with the initial components of Dart, you will see how flow of control and looping can be achieved by using if, else, and conditional expressions. Moving on to functions and objects, you will dig deeper into the concepts of object oriented programming to gauge the importance of constructors in Dart. You will then discover more about inheritance and mixins, seeing how they contain methods for use by other classes. \n\nAfter gauging the importance of abstract classes and methods, you will learn more about anonymous functions such as lambdas and closures. You will then take a look at key data structures including lists and maps to aid you in organizing your information for storage and retrieval. After all this you’ll move on to managing exceptions arising from executing your program. Finally, Dart programming relies heavily on libraries to perform a variety of functions.

As companies transform their businesses to meet the demands of the digital age, they find themselves grappling with uniquely human challenges. Organizational knowledge becomes siloed, employees move to safeguard their expertise, and customer data creates polarization and infighting between teams. All of these challenges widen the distance between the people who make your products and the customers who use them.\n\nTo meet today’s challenges, companies need to do more than build processes for customer-driven products. They need to create a customer-driven culture.\n\nWith the help of his friend and mentor Monty Hammontree, Travis Lowdermilk takes readers through the cultural transformation of the Developer Division at Microsoft.

Written for both designers and developers, this book demonstrates the power of both Sass and Compass through a series of examples that address common pain points associated with traditional stylesheet authoring. The book begins with simple topics such as CSS resets and moves on to more involved topics such as grid frameworks and CSS3 vendor implementation differences.\n\nAbout the Technology\n\nSass is an extension of CSS3, adding language features for creating well-formatted, standard CSS using the command line tool or a web-framework plugin. Compass is a framework that sits atop Sass and tackles common stylesheet problems such as grid layouts, handling CSS3 vendor differences, and production environment stylesheet optimization. Together, they do for CSS what jQuery has done for JavaScript: solve real world problems, letting designers and developers create stylesheets more efficiently.\n\nAbout the Book\n\nFor 15 years, we've been using CSS to patiently paint the web by hand. No more! Sass and Compass add scripting and a library of components to standard CSS so you can simplify stylesheet authoring, automate tedious tasks, and add dynamic styling features to your pages. Think of Sass and Compass as power tools that allow you to paint with remarkable speed and precision.\n\nSass and Compass in Action is a hands-on guide to stylesheet authoring using these two revolutionary tools. This practical book shows you how to eliminate common CSS pain points and concentrate on making your pages pop.

Ambushed by speed, complexity, and uncertainty, many of us are unprepared for this acceleration. We act on autopilot as new challenges confront us. We are too reactive to problems and miss out on opportunities. We get hijacked by conflicting values and polarizing relationships. We face uncertainty with fear and mistrust. Stress and burnout are pervasive as many of us do not perform up to our potential.\n\nOrganizations are not adapting well either. Seventy percent of change efforts fail. Slow execution, unrealized growth, unhealthy cultures, and obsession with short-term results undermine long-term success. Inside communities, there is more tension, diminishing trust in our institutions, and a growing inability to solve our most complex social problems. The primary culprit for these maladies is our lack of awareness.\n\nLet’s face it: Our current approach to change is running out of steam. And the cost of unaware people is too high to pay. In this age of acceleration, we need a fresh approach to living and leading.\n\nCONSCIOUS is our wake-up call – to be aware, awake, and accountable. Nothing is more important than understanding ourselves, our relationships, and our surroundings. Being conscious helps us think deeper, learn faster, and collaborate better. The more conscious we are, the faster we adapt, and the higher performing we become. Conscious is the new smart.\n\nAs one of the premier global experts on leadership and transformation, Bob Rosen and Healthy Companies have revealed a profound truth about modern-day change: the most successful people, at all levels of society, follow four powerful practices of being conscious:\n\nGo Deep – Discover your inner self\nThink Big – See a world of possibilities\nGet Real – Be honest and intentional\nStep Up – Act boldly and responsibly\n\nConscious is your personal roadmap through transformation – helping you adapt and accelerate into the future.

These frameworks include Social Return on Investment (SROI), Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA), and Pre and Post Comparison (and others).\n\nYou will use your chosen framework to develop a logic model or theory of change which demonstrates how the work that nonprofits do translates into the outputs and outcomes that clients experience and that nonprofits seek funding to deliver. After covering the theory, author Dustin MacDonald teaches you how to translate the framework you chose into Salesforce. You will learn how to create reports, dashboards, formula fields, roll up summaries, and other basic Salesforce tools in order to collect the information you need to validate your framework.\n\nThis book also demonstrates how to report on the outcomes you have achieved, tweak results to improve performance, and see the entire end-to-end experience in practice through a set of case studies.

Designing Service Excellence: People and Technology provides practical information on the design, management, and organization of many different types of service industries, such as hotels, restaurants, banks and financial institutions, retail, and the public sector. The authors investigate the consumers’ experience and judgment on service quality, which ultimately determines the success or failure of the service. They then consider people, usability, and technology in the automation of high-quality service.\n\nThis research-driven book identifies service—in a variety of forms—as an area of business and management where rapid change is taking place. The authors examine how service has become a balance between people and technology and explore this relationship as one of the key drivers of change. They discuss how social, cultural, and technological developments influence the ways in which customers contact, negotiate, and purchase services from their chosen service providers. These same developments are also driving communications between customers relating to the services they buy and are willing to recommend to others (or otherwise). Intermingled, these features of our current-day lives have changed the nature of service provision and service use. When your organization has its moment of truth, how will it measure up? Organizations whose business has service at its core and whose activities focus mainly on service design, management, and delivery are likely to find increasingly that, for survival, service is a matter of life or death. This book provides a deep understanding of the relationship between people and technology along with an ergonomic approach to the design and management of service delivery that helps you deliver the value and benefits that customers not only want, but increasingly come to expect.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Sales","Customer Service"]},{"id":"9781786461049","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Mastering Zendesk","authors":["Cedric F.

How could they not have noticed?'. You think you can solve your human error problem by telling people to be more careful, by reprimanding the miscreants, by issuing a new rule or procedure. These are all expressions of 'The Bad Apple Theory', where you believe your system is basically safe if it were not for those few unreliable people in it. This old view of human error is increasingly outdated and will lead you nowhere. The new view, in contrast, understands that a human error problem is actually an organizational problem. Finding a 'human error' by any other name, or by any other human, is only the beginning of your journey, not a convenient conclusion. The new view recognizes that systems are inherent trade-offs between safety and other pressures (for example: production). People need to create safety through practice, at all levels of an organization. Breaking new ground beyond its successful predecessor, The Field Guide to Understanding Human Error guides you through the traps and misconceptions of the old view. It explains how to avoid the hindsight bias, to zoom out from the people closest in time and place to the mishap, and resist the temptation of counterfactual reasoning and judgmental language. But it also helps you look forward. It suggests how to apply the new view in building your safety department, handling questions about accountability, and constructing meaningful countermeasures. It even helps you in getting your organization to adopt the new view and improve its learning from failure. So if you are faced by a human error problem, abandon the fallacy of a quick fix.

Libertarian technologists who believed bitcoin would be the foundation of a new world order saw the moment as an apotheosis. Everyone else saw a bubble. Everyone else was right, and the bubble burst. But bitcoin survived, and the battle for its soul rages on.\n\nKings of Crypto drops us into the unfolding drama, tracing the rise, fall, and rebirth of cryptocurrency through the experiences of major players across the globe.

In addition, this book presents information about competing virtual currencies, and compares them to Bitcoin. Readers will also learn to judge the relative value and safety of the Bitcoin currency, and determine whether the rewards outweigh the risks.\n\nBitcoin is the virtual currency of the Internet, a distributed, worldwide, decentralized digital money. It's the most popular of several current cryptocurrencies, devised in 2009 by programmer Satoshi Nakamoto.(Although that's probably not his real name...)\n\nThe unit of currency in the Bitcoin system is called a bitcoin, or BTC. A bitcoin is not a physical currency, such as a dollar bill or nickel, but rather just a number associated with a Bitcoin Address. Unlike traditional currencies, Bitcoin is not issued from or managed by any central government bank or organization. With Bitcoin, users become their own banks – and assume all the risks inherent in that proposal. As such, the value of a bitcoin is not pegged to any traditional real-world currency. Over the currency's relatively short life, the dollar value of a bitcoin has fluctuated from 14 cents (actually, zero at inception) to more than $1,2000. (Today a bitcoin is worth approximately 800 US dollars.)\n\nBitcoin exists on a peer-to-peer network, much like BitTorrent. Users on the P2P network, called miners, enable their PCs to be used to host and manage bitcoin transactions. To use Bitcoin, a user must sign up with an online wallet service, through which all transactions are managed. This digital wallet is typically stored on the P2P servers, with all transactions secured via public-key encryption. The public key is used to encode all payments, which can then be retrieved only with the use of the user's private key.\n\nOne can earn bitcoins by providing goods or services to other users or by participating in the mining process. Users can also purchase bitcoins with traditional currency from one of several Bitcoin Exchanges. Bitcoins can then be spent on other goods and services available over the Internet.","tags":["Software Development","Blockchain / Decentralized Apps","Blockchain","Cryptocurrency","Bitcoin"]},{"id":"9781430264828","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Dart for Absolute Beginners","authors":["David Kopec"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"June 2014","description":"\"\n\nDart for Absolute Beginners enables individuals with no background in programming to create their own web apps while learning the fundamentals of software development in a cutting edge language.

It is now a vow many businesses make. However, the correlation between increasing customer satisfaction and increasing customer spending with your company is very weak, according to the authors. Their research finds that changes in customers’ satisfaction levels explain less than 1% of variation in a company’s share of category spending. Is customer satisfaction worth the cost? To find out, the authors investigated the relationship between customer satisfaction and business outcomes, gathering data from more than 100,000 consumers covering more than 300 brands. Although high customer satisfaction ratings are typically treated by managers as being universally good for business, the authors’ findings indicate that the benefits are not nearly so clear-cut. There is a downside to continuously devoting resources to raise customer satisfaction levels. Managers are rarely able to accurately quantify the cost associated with increasing customer satisfaction scores (for example, from 8.7 to 9.1 on a 10-point scale), nor are they able to determine precisely what such an increase is actually worth. It turns out the return on these investments is often trivial or even negative. Knowing a customer’s satisfaction level tells you little about how he or she will divide his or her spending among the different brands used. As a result, changes in customer satisfaction levels are unlikely to have a meaningful impact on the share of category spending customers allocate with your brand. Why? Single-brand loyalty, which was common in our parents’ and grandparents’ generations, has been replaced with loyalty to multiple brands in a category in many sectors. Because of this divided loyalty, more customers partially defect (in other words, they give more of their business to a competitor) than completely defect from a business or brand. As a result, improving customers’ share of spending with your brand tends to represent a far greater opportunity than efforts to improve customer retention. kThe measure that really matters, according to the authors, isn’t your percentage of delighted customers or promoters. What matters is the relative “rank” that your brand’s satisfaction level represents vis-àvis your competitors.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Sales","Customer Service"]},{"id":"9781119885627","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Sustainably Investing in Digital Assets Globally","authors":["Selva Ozelli"],"pages":"384","publication_date":"October 2022","description":"Discover how to dip your toe into the cryptocurrency investing pool without getting burned\n\nIn Sustainably Investing in Digital Assets Globally, international finance and fintech expert Selva Ozelli delivers an eye-opening and insightful discussion of cryptocurrency investment, as well as the risks and opportunities that await those who deal in this promising new technology.

Rust","Chekitan S. Dev"],"pages":"6","publication_date":"January 2016","description":"Companies must make important decisions about which features to include in the goods and services they offer to customers. Understanding the return on investment for a feature is essential to increasing profitability. Although tadding features increases costs, it may also increase revenues, either by attracting new customers or retaining existing customers. Yet the features that retain customers, the authors argue, may be different from the features that initially attract them.\n\nThe authors provide insights from their research on how to calculate the return on investment for features. Working with a global hotel company, the authors developed a model to assess how features produce financial returns by attracting new customers and/or by retaining existing customers. The model integrates three kinds of data: the revenue increase due to the effect the feature has on attracting new customers; the revenue increase due to the effect the feature has on retaining existing customers; and the costs associated with adding the feature. They tested the model using three features, or \"amenities of interest,\" in the hotel industry: bottled water, free internet access, and a fitness center.\n\nNot surprisingly, the authors found that free wireless internet was much more likely to attract customers than free bottled water. However, the picture changed when the authors switched from looking at features that attracted guests to features that retained them. Offering free bottled water during a stay led to a bigger boost in customer retention than offering wireless internet access.\n\nWhy the difference? The authors argue that, although customers may have a good sense of the value of some amenities prior to using them (such as in-room internet), the value of other amenities (such as bottled water or a well-equipped fitness center) may be more visceral or emotional, and they may influence the consumer's evaluation of the overall service experience in a more holistic manner. It's harder for both consumers and companies to predict how visceral or emotional reactions to features will affect future behavior.\n\nFrom their research, the authors conclude that companies shouldn't rush to add new features that seem promising. Rather, they should first ask a series of questions:\n\n• Why should I add this feature to my offering? When considering a new feature, think about whether the feature is likely to attract new customers, retain existing customers, or both.\n\n• Do my competitors offer the feature? The desire to match competitive offerings often leads to what's known as feature fatigue and amenity creep. Although benchmarking is important, it is more important with features designed to attract customers than with features designed to retain customers.\n\n• How can I measure the effects of adding a feature on customer retention? Surveys, interviews, focus groups, and conjoint analysis are very useful for predicting whether specific features will attract customers. However, because customers often have a harder time predicting whether features will influence their repeat purchases, directly asking them is unlikely to generate accurate estimates of a feature's effect on retention. Instead, the authors say, it is often better to use A/B testing, which involves implementing a feature in a few different settings and comparing the results with those where the feature hasn't been added.","tags":["Business","Project & Product Management","Product Management","Customer Experience"]},{"id":"9781787282803","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Enduring CSS","authors":["Ben Frain"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"January 2017","description":"\"Enduring CSS\" teaches you how to create structured, scalable, and maintainable CSS for projects of any size.

GoFundMe was pressured to cut off funding to protesting truckers in Ottawa. Disney's CEO was dragged down for mishandling both sides of Florida's \"Don't Say Gay\" law. Facebook and other tech companies have been accused of manipulating elections in many countries and by many parties.\n\nPeople are angry with the world—in some cases, rightfully so—and now view companies as they do governments, as targets of their wrath and potential forces for social change. Managing outrage has moved from being an occasional leadership challenge, like handling a PR crisis, to a necessary and critical leadership capability, like strategic thinking or financial acumen.\n\nBased on his popular University of Oxford leadership course and case studies on organizations such as IKEA, Nestlé, the Vatican, and others, Karthik Ramanna offers practical steps to make sense of the outrage, work with relevant stakeholders to progress through it, and emerge stronger for it. Ramanna's pragmatic framework, developed through years of experience with organizations, helps leaders \"turn down the temperature,\" analyze root causes, develop and implement responses that are mission-consistent, and build resilience.\n\nThe Age of Outrage is an essential guide for leaders and their teams in this new era of polarization.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Culture in Business"]},{"id":"9798892790956","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"HBR's 10 Must Reads on Employee Engagement (featuring \"The Power of Hidden Teams\" by Marcus Buckingham and Ashley Goodall)","authors":["Harvard Business Review","Adam Grant","Marcus Buckingham"],"pages":"208","publication_date":"July 2025","description":"Engage your employees and transform your organization.\n\nIf you read nothing else on employee engagement, read this book.

This book is a broad and deep exploration of CRM, providing practical, fact-based perspectives that every company can use to validate and rethink their customer and stakeholder relationships.\"\n\n— Helmuth Cepeda, Small, Medium and Distribution Director, Microsoft Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico\n\nMarketing has changed fundamentally in the last few years and has become an entirely new discipline, one that focuses on a new customer and a new relationship, framed by new principles, strategies, processes, roles and tactics. Individual customers are economically targeted and served, and treated as segments of one rather than members of a target market. Word of mouth and recommendations are vital as customers influence one another more than a company can do within its own advertising or customer dialogs. Today's customer is always online, accessible and connected. Now marketing is not only direct and customer-specific but a continuous process by which companies seek to engage customers and be progressively more relevant, attractive and valuable. This is the era of a new customer relationship—an individual relationship that is social, mobile and local, influenced by peers and shaped by cognitive, behavioural and social psychological principles. New techniques, processes and technologies transform what it means to implement marketing strategy and achieve improved business results.\n\nThe new customer relationship requires that even those companies that have embraced customer relationship management ought to reassess their customer management. Now every marketing decision, whether online or in the physical world, whether of a technological nature, whether it affects customer experience, communications, dialogs, teaching or organizational memory, every decision should be seen through a single lens focused on the individual customers who matter most. Managing the New Customer Relationship provides a strategic and practical guide to help companies attract, develop, sustain and build more valuable relationships by:\n\nExpanding upon existing customer relationship management theories, concepts and methods to make these considerations more useful, strategic and contemporary\n\nRecognizing the profound importance of social media and how to plan customer engagement in the social context of each customer\n\nExploring new technologies that offer new opportunities for engaging customers, including mobile, local, the cloud and customer analytics\n\nDemonstrating how to develop customer-specific understanding, predict what customers will want next, and how to manage each individual customer, and\n\nOffering perspectives to help the organization endure by focusing a chain of relationships on the end customer and creating meaning for stakeholders that can make relationships more intense and robust.\n\nManaging the New Customer Relationship is for organizations of all sizes in all industries, for private- and public-sector organizations and not-for-profits. In short, every organization can apply the new principles, strategies, techniques and technologies discussed here to recognize important marketplace changes, plan to improve relationship and financial results and capture new shareholder value from new customer relationships.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Sales","Customer Relationship Management (CRM)"]},{"id":"9780080464190","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Managing Customer Service, 5th Edition","authors":["Institute of Leadership & Institute of Leadership & Management"],"pages":"120","publication_date":"June 2013","description":"Super series are a set of workbooks to accompany the flexible learning programme specifically designed and developed by the Institute of Leadership & Management (ILM) to support their Level 3 Certificate in First Line Management.

Bennett, Partner, Global Brand Positioning, previously Chief Marketing Officer, Visa, Inc.\n\n\"While directors know reputation is important, it often is treated as a vague 'good' until something bad happens. Nir Kossovsky does a great job, with many examples, of connecting reputation to stock price and to behaviors, before and after crises. If you are a director, a senior manager, or a regulator, you should read this book and remember the lessons it offers. There is no office which will restore reputation, but careful planning and quick response, as Nir points out, can make a big difference.\"\n\n—Herbert S.

Reputation, Stock Price, and You: Why the Market Rewards Some Companies and Punishes Others shows how a company's reputation is created and how reputational value impacts corporate P&L and the personal finances of its many stakeholders. Better yet, it shows what you can do to profit from, increase, protect, monitor, evaluate, restore, and even insure reputational value.\n\nIf your job, bonus, options, salary, or investments depend on the stock price of a public company—or on the sales, profitability, or value of a private company—you need to read this book to understand the concrete steps you can take to improve your firm's reputation, reduce risks to its finances and industry standing, and reap the highest reputational dividends. Using dozens of case studies, Reputation, Stock Price, and You:\n\nExplains how stakeholders, and their expectations, both shape and are shaped by a company's reputation\n\nDescribes how reputations for ethics, innovation, governance, quality, safety, sustainability, and security are created and lost\n\nShows how you can influence the expectations and behaviors of stakeholders, which in turn can improve corporate finances, reduce operational risk, and increase stock price or market value\n\nProvides sensitive tools for tracking and predicting stock price as a function of reputational value metrics\n\nThe majority of directors at U.S. public companies now count reputation as their firm's #1 concern, and with good reason.

So says Joseph Jaffe, bestselling author of Life After the 30-Second Spot and Join the Conversation, and a leading expert and thought leader on new media and social media. In most businesses, it costs roughly five-to-ten times more to acquire a new customer than it does to retain an existing one, and yet companies continue to disproportionately spend their budgets into the \"wrong\" end of the funnel – the mass media or awareness side.\n\nWhat we haven't paid enough attention to is the \"right\" end of the funnel-the word-of-mouth component that essentially acts as a multiplier for future business. The economic impact of an active, engaged and loyal customer is tremendous.\n\nAnd the same is true of the opposite scenario, namely the impact of angry customers and negative word-of-mouth or referrals. It is this thinking that Jaffe has channeled to challenge marketers to \"flip the funnel\" once and for all. With a renewed focus and energy on customer experience, it is possible to grow your sales, while decreasing your budget – in other words, getting more from less. Engaging a few customers to spread the word to many.\n\nUsing this new \"flipped funnel\" model, together with a set of new rules of customer service and a revolutionary customer referral and activation process, you'll learn how to transform your existing customers into your best salespeople. In addition, Jaffe will explain how to best introduce and combine both digital and social media tools to boost your loyalty arsenal, deploy \"influencer marketing\" and implement word-of-mouth strategies that inspire your loyal, opinionated, and most vocal customers to become credible, persuasive, and influential endorsers of your products and services.\n\nExplains how to cut your marketing budget AND grow sales!\nIllustrates practical ways to use existing customers to reach out to new prospects\nOutlines the authentic role of social media\nDemonstrates key ideas with rich, real life examples including Comcast, Apple, The Obama Campaign, Dell, Panasonic, American Airlines, Delta Airlines, Johnson & Johnson, Coca-Cola and many, many more\nWritten by one of the most sought-after consultants, keynote speakers, and thought-leaders on new marketing change and innovation; renowned blogger and podcaster at Jaffe Juice (www.jaffejuice.com) and host/presenter of web video show, JaffeJuiceTV (www.jaffejuice.tv)\n\nVisit www.flipthefunnelnow.com to join the conversation.","tags":["Business","Project & Product Management","Product Management","Customer Experience"]},{"id":"9780134463667","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Customer Service: How to Attract, Retain, and Interact with High-Quality Customers","authors":["Jeff Havens"],"pages":"100","publication_date":"December 2015","description":"Includes Complete Participant & Instructor Workbooks!\n\nOverview\n\nYour fast, fun resource for delivering outstanding customer service: the perfect complement to Jeff Havens’s Customer Service video course!\n\nDescription\n\nIn an era where many companies offer similar products and services at similar prices, it’s hard to stand out.

The authors are the developers of the European Central Bank's (ECB) standard for the description of financial instruments. The ECB has adopted this approach because it is an extremely flexible, innovative, yet logically simple and consistent way to accurately define and set up even very large numbers of financial instruments, and because it simplifies the valuation, risk and performance measurement process. This is because it standardizes and breaks up the calculation task into simpler subtasks, thus preparing the way for a faster road to improvements in speed and accuracy.This is the only book that explains the new ECB standard, and provides clear and consistent worked examples and programming code throughout the book to demonstrate to the reader how to use the standard to build financial instruments in software systems, then how to price them, and then how to measure the risk and performance of the portfolios that comprise them.The aim of this book is to introduce the reader to a practical approach for pricing a broad range of financial instruments and analysing the risk and performance of simple and complex portfolios. Carefully chosen worked examples will allow the reader to gain confidence in using securities and derivatives pricing models and risk and performance measurement methods commonly used in today's risk and portfolio management practice. Its practical focus, systematic step by step approach and fully up to date coverage of pricing, risk and performance measurement analytics will set this book apart from competing publications and fill a growing need for a practical introduction to financial engineering and risk and performance measurement. The key value proposition for this book is that it is based on the authors? experience of designing and implementing valuation, risk measurement, and performance measurement solutions, and in particular developing and implementing the European Central Bank's (ECB) standard for the description of financial instruments. The book will thus help the reader bridge the gap from understanding pricing, risk and performance measurement models to their practical implementation in software based solutions.The book introduces the reader to an approach developed by the authors while working for the European Central Bank. It allows to price and analyse any instrument in terms of a limited set of atomic instruments. The pricing and risk relevant characteristics of any financial instrument can thus be decomposed into those of a small set of atomic instruments that represent the given instrument well. The instrument can then be priced and performance and risk analytics for it can be calculated using well known robust models utilizing readily available information. This approach allows the reader to overcome the situation of having to master a myriad of specific instrument variants and their pricing and risk measurement models, by being able to make reference to a single framework.This approach was selected first because it is an extremely flexible, innovative and yet logically simple and consistent way to accurately define and set up even very large numbers of financial instruments of every description from simple to complex and from traditional to one-off and just invented, and second because it simplifies the valuation, risk and performance measurement calculation process. This is because it standardizes and breaks up the calculation task into simpler subtasks thus preparing the way for a faster road to improvements in speed and accuracy. The book then builds on this with further guidance, telling the reader what is relevant and what not, and showing how to structure a variety of implementation problems to be successful in the career-threatening task of getting a risk and performance measurement system up and running.Starting with an in-depth examination of how to price instruments, the book will build up a practical framework for the analysis of the market and credit risk exposure of financial instruments and portfolios as well as the calculation of risk adjusted performance measures relevant for the business of investment funds / trust managers and financial institutions. Building on this practical approach to pricing the book will then survey different approaches to risk measurement and show the reader how to implement a simulation based approach to measuring instrument and portfolio based Value at Risk (VAR) and Expected Tail Risk (ETL).Finally the book will survey different approaches to measuring the risk adjusted performance of investment portfolios (financial institutions) and show how these measurements may be implemented in the context of the book's logical framework.Feature: The authors have designed and implemented the European Central Bank's standard for the description of financial instrumentsBenefit: The reader can rely on accurate and valid information about describing financial instrumentsFeature: The authors have developed an approach for pricing and analyzing any financial instrument using a limited set of atomic instrumentsBenefit: The reader can use these instruments, validated through the ECB, to define and set up even very large numbers of financial instruments.Feature: The book builds a practical framework for analysing the market and credit risk exposure of financial instruments and portfoliosBenefit: Readers can use this framework today in their work and identify and measure market and credit risk using a reliable method validated by the ECB","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Corporate Valuation"]},{"id":"9780240820606","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"The Screenwriter’s Roadmap","authors":["Neil Landau"],"pages":"204","publication_date":"May 2013","description":"Finally, a GPS system for screenwriters!The potentially long and arduous journey of writing a screenplay was just made easier to navigate with The Screenwriter's Roadmap.

And the harsh truth is that the majority of decisions—no matter how good the intentions behind them—are mismanaged, resulting in a huge toll on organizations, the people they employ, and even the people they serve.So why is it so hard to make sound decisions? In Think Twice, now in paperback, Michael Mauboussin argues that we often fall victim to simplified mental routines that prevent us from coping with the complex realities inherent in important judgment calls. Yet these cognitive errors are preventable.In this engaging book, Mauboussin shows us how to recognize and avoid common mental missteps. These include misunderstanding cause-and-effect linkages, not considering enough alternative possibilities in making a decision, and relying too much on experts.Through vivid stories, the author presents memorable rules for avoiding each error and explains how to recognize when you should “think twice”—questioning your reasoning and adopting decision-making strategies that are far more effective, even if they seem counterintuitive.

Soon consumers will be able to: Control the flow and use of personal data Build their own loyalty programs Dictate their own terms of service Tell whole markets what they want, how they want it, where and when they should be able to get it, and how much it should costAnd they will do all of this outside of any one vendor’s silo. This new landscape we’re entering is what Doc Searls calls The Intention Economyone in which demand will drive supply far more directly, efficiently, and compellingly than ever before. In this book he describes an economy driven by consumer intent, where vendors must respond to the actual intentions of customers instead of vying for the attention of many.New customer tools will provide the engine, with VRM (Vendor Relationship Management) providing the consumer counterpart to vendors’ CRM (Customer Relationship Management) systems. For example, imagine being able to change your address once for every company you deal with, or combining services from multiple companies in real time, in your own waysall while keeping an auditable accounting of every one of your interactions in the marketplace.

But to leverage the full power of CSS, web authors first have to sift through CSS theory to find practical solutions that resolve real-world problems. Web authors can waste hours and earn ulcers trying to find answers to those all-too-common dilemmas that crop up with each project. The CSS Cookbook cuts straight through the theory to provide hundreds of useful examples and CSS code recipes that web authors can use immediately to format their web pages. The time saved by a single one of these recipes will make its cover price money well-spent. But the CSS Cookbook provides more than quick code solutions to pressing problems. The explanation that accompanies each recipe enables readers to customize the formatting for their specific purposes, and shows why the solution works, so you can adapt these techniques to other situations.

This is relevant today because every organization that implements Salesforce will face the same issues around governance, integration, development, and security and the majority of organizations will find, through trial and error, a solution to govern these components. This book will help Salesforce professionals and enterprise organizations as well as small and mid-sized businesses (SMBs) navigate these topics and ultimately have a successful and fully integrated, secure Salesforce implementation.\n\n \n\nWhat You Will Learn\n\nGovern the application architecture on the Salesforce platform, including general architecture, localization and global deployments, workflow and process, formulas and files, and social\nGovern the data architecture, including design and data optimization, performance, predictive and actual data volumes, and datamovement\nGovern the identity and access management aspects of the application and Salesforce platform\nGovern the low-level platform capabilities delivered through Lightning, Visualforce, and Apex\nHandle community implementations that bring specific features into the Salesforce platform for consideration and governance\nCreate checklists for the governance steps, laid out in the method, and for any tooling recommendations that can help simplify the process of governance\n\n \n\nWho This Book Is For\n\nPeople responsible for maintaining a Salesforce SaaS instance or developing changes for that Salesforce instance.

Rachev"],"pages":"280","publication_date":"January 2009","description":"In the last decade rating-based models have become very popular in credit risk management. These systems use the rating of a company as the decisive variable to evaluate the default risk of a bond or loan. The popularity is due to the straightforwardness of the approach, and to the upcoming new capital accord (Basel II), which allows banks to base their capital requirements on internal as well as external rating systems. Because of this, sophisticated credit risk models are being developed or demanded by banks to assess the risk of their credit portfolio better by recognizing the different underlying sources of risk. As a consequence, not only default probabilities for certain rating categories but also the probabilities of moving from one rating state to another are important issues in such models for risk management and pricing. It is widely accepted that rating migrations and default probabilities show significant variations through time due to macroeconomics conditions or the business cycle. These changes in migration behavior may have a substantial impact on the value-at-risk (VAR) of a credit portfolio or the prices of credit derivatives such as collateralized debt obligations (D+CDOs). In this book the authors develop a much more sophisticated analysis of migration behavior. Their contribution of more sophisticated techniques to measure and forecast changes in migration behavior as well as determining adequate estimators for transition matrices is a major contribution to rating based credit modeling.*Internal ratings-based systems are widely used in banks to calculate their value-at-risk (VAR) in order to determine their capital requirements for loan and bond portfolios under Basel II*One aspect of these ratings systems is credit migrations, addressed in a systematic and comprehensive way for the first time in this book*The book is based on in-depth work by Trueck and Rachev,","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Corporate Valuation"]},{"id":"059610197X","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Head First HTML with CSS & XHTML","authors":["Elisabeth Robson","Eric Freeman"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"December 2005","description":"Tired of reading HTML books that only make sense after you're an expert?

Then service gets to make a brief appearance – for as long as it takes to calm the customer down and fix whatever foul-up jeopardized the relationship.In Uncommon Service, Frances Frei and Anne Morriss show how, in a volatile economy where the old rules of strategic advantage no longer hold true, service must become a competitive weapon, not a damage-control function. That means weaving service tightly into every core decision your company makes. The authors reveal a transformed view of service, presenting an operating model built on tough choices organizations must make:• How do customers define “excellence” in your offering? Is it convenience? Friendliness? Flexible choices? Price?• How will you get paid for that excellence? Will you charge customers more? Get them to handle more service tasks themselves? • How will you empower your employees to deliver excellence? What will your recruiting, selection, training, and job design practices look like? What about your organizational culture? • How will you get your customers to behave? For example, what do you need to do to get them to treat your employees with respect? Do you need to make it easier for them to use new technology?Practical and engaging, Uncommon Service makes a powerful case for a new and systematic approach to service as a means of boosting productivity, profitability, and competitive advantage.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Sales","Customer Service"]},{"id":"9781439845813","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Your Customers' Perception of Quality","authors":["Baboo Kureemun","Robert Fantina"],"pages":"225","publication_date":"April 2011","description":"Providing the insight and tools needed to improve the perception your customers have about the quality of your product or service, Your Customers' Perception of Quality: What It Means to Your Bottom Line and How to Control It introduces a ground-breaking model for measuring the impact of quality perception on your bottom line.

The studies published in this volume, based on the international conferences of both the Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften and the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities, aim to contribute to this field of interest by dealing with concepts and influences of rationalization in Judaism, Christianity, Islam and religion in general. In addition to taking a closer look at the immediate links in the history of tradition between those rationalizing movements and evolutions in religion, emphasis is put on intellectual-historical convergences: Therefore, the articles are led by central comparative questions, such as what factors foster/hinder rationalization?; where are criteria for rationalization drawn from?; in which institutions is rationalization taking place?; who propagates, supports and utilizes rationalization?","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Development","Critical Thinking"]},{"id":"9781264268856","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"The Business of Race: How to Create and Sustain an Antiracist Workplace—And Why it’s Actually Good for Business","authors":["Margaret H.

If you are a business leader, individual contributor, Human Resources or DEI (Diversity, Equity and Inclusion) professional, educator, coach, or consultant, then The Business of Race is for you. In the business world, incident-driven, company position statements on Black Lives Matter or Stop Asian Hate are not proxies for the heavy lifting that will penetrate and sustain a shift in the status quo. Advancing racial equity to disrupt institutional racism requires more than a company-wide memo or a tab on a corporate website. Businesses often water down, negate or skirt this reality by touting successes from its cousin—diversity. However, you cannot advance a strategy you do not name. The general term “diversity” enables that dynamic. It’s impossible to create an antiracist workplace when we avoid speaking the words ``race” and “racism.” Co-authored by two business women, one Black and one White, The Business of Race can help us all prepare for this transformative work. Rather than diving headfirst with well-meaning but ineffectual efforts, we must first ready our organizations. The authors outline both the inner work (raising our own individual awareness and creating new ways of thinking and being), and the outer work organizations must undertake. This includes honest and often uncomfortable discussions. And carrying out as core to operational business strategy and performance, policies and practices to reimagine a racially equitable workplace. Whether you’re a rising entrepreneur, a supervisor or manager, a leader of a large multinational company, or a frontline employee, you’ll find concrete actions in this essential guide:\nWhy Racial Diversity, Why Now – A Competitive Advantage\nCommitment, Specificity, and the Science of Small Wins\nUncomfortable Truths and Fearless Leaders\nLook for Talent Where Others Are Not\nNo Secrets in Pay and Promotions – Close the Wage Gap\nDiscover Your “E” and Measure its Impact\nWoven throughout The Business of Race are interviews with dozens of business professionals across myriad industries, fields and organizational levels.

As an update to Evans's earlier book Social Media Marketing, the new Social Customer Experience connects the early cases presented in 2010 with significant, contemporary examples, key concepts, and best practices associated with the adoption of social technology by global brands. This latest edition offers a blueprint for transforming your organization's disparate social initiatives into a unified social experience strategy. Most people know that social technologies are transforming business, but few understand how those changes are happening across the organization. Whether in marketing, communications, customer care, digital media or product development these changes shape the way in which business manage the experience their customers have with the brand. Filled with practical examples of what to do, and illustrated with cases taken from real companies, Social Customer Experience fills in the gaps for companies who want to do more with social than just listen and experiment.\n\nPart I lays the groundwork by explaining the three waves of change that combine to form social customer experience: social technologies and their impact on Web 1.0 digital infrastructures; social customers and their impact on marketing and support operations; and the new discipline of customer experience management that is reframing the old sales-and-service-centric ways of thinking about how companies relate to customers. Part I concludes by defining the social customer experience ecosystem, both on and off your own web domain.\n\nPart II, \"Your Social Presence,\" puts you on the ground, with tactics and examples for how to apply social technologies and achieve your business objectives, how to measure and analyze social data and show business value, and how to implement a best-practice approach to avoid common traps and pursue proven opportunities.\n\nPart III digs deeper into the five building blocks of social customer experience: organization, platform, content, people and tools. What's a social experience organization look like? What systems need to be in place? How do you get the most out of the social \"objects\" - content and other assets - that are the byproduct of great social customer experiences? How do connections between customers - the social graph - come into play? And what applications will you use - literally, what will you empower your customers to do? Part III answers these questions in the practical, method-driven style of authors Dave Evans and Joe Cothrel.\n\nSocial Customer Experience features detailed exercises that show you how to translate learning into action, hands-on tutorials using today's social media tools and platforms, and compelling, modern case studies from organizations of all sizes—from the Fortune 500 to nonprofits and mom-n-pop main-street shops. As a bonus, the book also features resources and references to connect readers with the current thought leaders and sources of timely information.\n\nIf you're interested in business, and how business is being reshaped by social technology, Social Customer Experience will show you a path to a new relationship with your customers, customers not only buy your products and services but get more out of them and go on to become partners in your business-selling, supporting, and innovating on your behalf.","tags":["Business","Project & Product Management","Product Management","Customer Experience"]},{"id":"9780240522463","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Alternative Scriptwriting, 5th Edition","authors":["Ken Dancyger","Jeff Rush"],"pages":"466","publication_date":"October 2013","description":"Learn the rules of scriptwriting, and then how to successfully break them.Unlike other screenwriting books, this unique guide pushes you to challenge yourself and break free of tired, formulaic writing--bending or breaking the rules of storytelling as we know them.

But evidence is mounting that applying personal, Band-Aid solutions to an epic and rapidly evolving workplace phenomenon isn't enough—in fact, it's not even close.

Adjei","Jill J. Avery"],"pages":"8","publication_date":"January 2014","description":"Most managers know that listening to customers makes good business sense. Businesses have much to gain from actively seeking and encouraging customer participation, which the authors define as getting customers to provide constructive suggestions and share their ideas on how to shape product and service offerings. Yet many companies only pay lip service to this idea. Rather than encouraging customers to share their views about the company and its products with managers, the authors found, companies tend to focus on encouraging customers to take part in spreading positive word of mouth. Yet word of mouth is only one type of voluntary behavior that customers engage in. Moreover, it indicates only what people on the outside are saying, not how companies can improve their offerings or what customers may be looking for. The authors, who conducted surveys of customers as well as interviews and roundtable discussions with senior executives in a variety of industries, found that both customer word of mouth and customer- to-business interactions are associated with a customer’s propensity to buy more of a company’s products and services. While not all satisfied customers become repeat buyers, encouraging them to provide feedback and suggestions helps tie them more closely to the business. Companies can even recapture defecting customers simply by contacting them and encouraging them to participate. In addition, customer-to-business interaction is often more malleable than customer-to-customer word of mouth and more readily within the control of management. In a study of customers of a global bank, the authors found that customers who purchased the most were individuals who participated and engaged in much word-of-mouth behavior. High participation/ high word-of-mouth customers were the most loyal and attached to the brand; customers who did not participate tended to be the least valuable, the least loyal and the least attached to the organization regardless of whether they spread positive word of mouth. The implications of the findings are that fostering customer participation can be very valuable and that companies are better off emphasizing customer participation over word of mouth (as opposed to the reverse), because it creates more customer “stickiness” (as in greater attachment and commitment). Nevertheless, the authors say, the two approaches should be seen as two sides of a coin, working both internally and externally to build financial value for companies.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Sales","Customer Service"]},{"id":"9781615421343","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Take Control of Scrivener 2","authors":["Kirk McElhearn"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"August 2016","description":"Finally, write your novel or screenplay with Scrivener 2!\n\nUpdated August 24, 2016\n\nIn this book, you'll take a creative voyage with Scrivener, a unique and popular content-generation tool. Scrivener supports wordsmiths of all types, and it's designed especially for long-form writing projects -- scripts, novels, academic works, and more.\n\nAuthor Kirk McElhearn walks you through using Scrivener to create and manage a writing project. You'll learn how to use Scrivener's Binder, Outliner, and Corkboard to develop characters and settings, collect and organize research materials, and arrange your scenes. Kirk even explains how to keep yourself on track by switching to Compose Mode and by setting daily progress targets, all on the way to helping you produce a polished, submission-ready manuscript.\n\nThe book covers the Mac and Windows desktop versions of Scrivener (screenshots are from a Mac), and it has a special chapter covering key techniques for using the new iOS Scrivener app on your iPad or iPhone.\n\nYou'll learn how to handle each aspect of the flexible Scrivener manuscript-generation process:\n\nSet up: Add reference materials to your project for easy access -- videos, audio files, PDFs, Web resources, and more. And, if you've already written bits of text, you can import those items too, including OPML outline files (such as from OmniOutliner Pro). Beyond importing from the Finder, you can use Mac OS X Services or Scrivener's handy Scratch Pad panel. Or, you can use the Import and Split feature to import a long document into multiple chapters or segments in Scrivener.\n\nOrganize: Use the Outliner, Corkboard, Collections, and Binder to mix and match your content into the perfect final arrangement. For example, you can:\n\nIgnore the concept of a traditional file and break your manuscript into sections based on character, theme, topic, scene, or whatever you like.\nOrganize your manuscript linearly in the Outliner.\nUse search Collections to search for a character, location, or phrase and see just those texts.\nOrganize ideas by dragging and pinning index cards on the Corkboard.\n\nWrite: Learn how to hide distractions so you can wordsmith in peace, whether in Full Screen Editing Mode in Windows or the Mac, or Compose Mode on the Mac; set up Typewriter Scrolling to keep your writing focus at the center of the screen, not the bottom; and view more than one part of your project at once, so you can write in one section while referring to another. Also, use Scrivenings view to write one thread of a story all at once in a single view, even if it is broken up in multiple scenes or chapters in the final manuscript.\n\nFormat: Optimize the formatting you see when you work in Scrivener for your eyes and your screen, and understand how this can differ from the formatting in a \"compiled\" version of your manuscript.\n\nRevise: Use revision marking and the useful Snapshot capability to experiment with and compare the effect of different revision strategies, while still being able to roll back to a previous version.\n\nBe mobile: Easily move projects between iOS devices and desktop computers using either an iTunes sync or the Dropbox file sharing service. Explore the Scrivener for iOS interface, uncover the productivity secrets hidden in the special extended keyboard row provided by Scrivener, and take advantage of keyboard shortcuts if you connect a physical keyboard to your iOS device.\n\nCompile: Don't worry if the term \"compile\" is unfamiliar; it enables you to assemble your manuscript into linear order, in a form that can be printed or converted to common file formats. Scrivener supports RTF, Microsoft Word, OpenOffice, Final Draft, PDF, Mobi, and EPUB.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Communication","Creative Writing"]},{"id":"9780470318126","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Salesforce.com® For Dummies®","authors":["Tom Wong","Liz Kao"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"August 2008","description":"Ready to start solving business challenges with CRM (Customer Relationship Management) software?

The authors explain how “world class” status can be attained by many organizations, and isn’t the domain of only the most expensive, luxurious, or popular brands.\n\nJones and Kober guide you by detailing benchmark practices and illustrating how they are followed by all best-in-class organizations by viewing each person inside and around the organization as your “customer”—internally, as you engage your employees and build your organization’s culture, and externally, as you engage your customers and build your brand. For this second edition, the authors present updated examples from organizations including IKEA, Harley-Davidson, Southwest Airlines, Ritz-Carlton, MD Anderson Cancer Center, and, of course, Walt Disney.","tags":["Business","Project & Product Management","Product Management","Customer Experience"]},{"id":"9780134133997","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"The Definitive Guide to Social CRM: Maximizing Customer Relationships with Social Media to Gain Market Insights, Customers, and Profits","authors":["Barton Goldenberg"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"March 2015","description":"This is the Rough Cut version of the printed book.\n\nMake Social CRM work!

They are trying to prevent the next Rana Plaza factory collapse, the next Deepwater Horizon explosion, the next Foxconn labor abuses. Obviously, they don’t always succeed. Christine Bader was one of those people. She loved BP and then-CEO John Browne’s lofty rhetoric on climate change and human rights—until a string of fatal BP accidents, Browne’s abrupt resignation under a cloud of scandal, and the start of Tony Hayward’s tenure as chief executive, which would end with the Deepwater Horizon disaster. Bader’s story of working deep inside the belly of the beast is unique in its details, but not in its themes: of feeling like an outsider both inside the company (accused of being a closet activist) and out (assumed to be a corporate shill); of getting mixed messages from senior management; of being frustrated with corporate life but committed to pushing for change from within. The Evolution of a Corporate Idealist: When Girl Meets Oil is based on Bader’s experience with BP and then with a United Nations effort to prevent and address human rights abuses linked to business.

While acknowledging that generational stereotypes exist, author Jessica Kriegel argues that they are wrong—and that it's unreasonable to assume that the millions of people born in the same 20-year time span are motivated by the same things, attracted to the same things, and should be dealt with in the same way. Kriegel's experience as Organizational Developer at Oracle puts her squarely in the talent strategy realm, where she works to optimize leadership development, team effectiveness, and organizational design. Drawing upon her experiences with workers of all ages and types, she shows how behaviors know no generational boundaries and how to work with people based on their talents, strengths, and weaknesses rather than simply slapping on a generational label and fitting them into an arbitrary slot.\n\nThere are 80 million Millenials in America, yet there are myriad books on \"managing Millenials\" and \"working with Millenials\" and \"the problem with Millenials.\" This book shows that whether you're working with Millenials, Generation X, or Baby Boomers, age is not the issue—it's the interpersonal dynamics that matter most.\n\nExamine the concept of \"generational issues\"\nExplore the disparate reality of each 20-year generational span\nLearn to understand and work effectively with other generations\nFacilitate intergenerational understanding sessions\n\nThe human mind craves categorization, so the tendency to lump people together is natural.

Alan Briskin shows how the modern organization has gradually increased its demands on us-beginning with our bodies, then our minds, and now our souls. But through the moving personal stories of people fighting to reclaim their souls, he also sends a message that encourages individuals to keep their spiritual integrity and values alive.In The Stirring of Soul In the Workplace, Briskin weaves together lessons from history, psychology, and management theory, with numerous real-life examples, to tell the story of how the modern workplace has evolved to value technology and productivity over soulfulness and relationship. From the Industrial Revolution's marriage of mechanization and efficiency to the management theories of the early 20th century, Briskin traces the emergence of the quest for efficiency and control in the workplace. He questions the corporate concept of \"individual personality\" that asks us to check our emotions, fantasies, imaginations, and souls at the door. He describes the history of the soul as a dynamic force that continues to influence our behavior, and shows how excluding it from our work life actually flattens our potential and dampens our creativity.Rather than solve the conventional question organizations have been asking for years-how can we change people?-Alan Briskin examines how organizations can better reflect personal and human values in the workplace. For organizations that too often have sacrificed the well-being of the individual for the goals of the organization, the author suggests a more active way of taking up our work roles that can bring more of our experience and imagination into play. He points out that meaning cannot come from corporate mission statements or reengineering programs. Instead, it needs to be nurtured through dialogue and reflection, the courage to ask troubling questions, and a willingness to face the consequences of our collective and individual actions. When we learn to honor the contradictions, uncertainties, and interconnections inherent in the workplace, the energies of the soul will begin to stir with revitalizing results.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Culture in Business"]},{"id":"9780240808499","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Alternative Scriptwriting, 4th Edition","authors":["Ken Dancyger","Jeff Rush"],"pages":"424","publication_date":"August 2012","description":"Alternative Scriptwriting 4E is an insightful and inspiring book on screenwriting concerned with challenging you to take creative risks with genre, tone, character, and structure.

No wonder Nordstrom is one of only five companies to make Fortune's \"Best Companies to Work For\" and \"Most Admired\" lists every year since those surveys have been taken.\n\nWith new interviews from senior Nordstrom executives and family members, the book explains how to successfully respond to today's tech-savvy, time-crunched customers who demand a convenient, seamless, painless, personal experience across all channels.

The Customer Trap takes this thesis to the next level by arguing that all companies, regardless of the industry there are in, should maintain control over their sales and distribution channels. Volume forgone by avoiding the mass market is more than offset by higher margins and stronger brand equity.\n\nThe Customer Trap shows that giving power to a customer who violates \"the ten percent rule\" sets a company up for ruin. Yet, when presented with the opportunity to push more sales through large customers, most decision-makers jump at the chance. As a result, marketing has come to resemble a relentless quest for efficiency and scale. Demands from mega-customers in the form of discounts, deals, and incentives erode the integrity of the brand and what it originally stood for. Lower margins become the norm and cost-saving compromises on quality take over. In time, the brand suffers and, in some cases, fails outright. Stark examples from Oreck Vacuum Cleaners, Rubbermaid, Goodyear, Levi’s, and others illustrate the perils of falling into the \"customer trap.\"\n\nThis book demonstrates in vivid detail how to thrive by controlling your sales and distribution. The authors show how many firms, such as STIHL Inc., etailz, Apple, Red Ant Pants, and Columbia Paints & Coatings, have prospered by avoiding the \"customer trap\"—and how your company can have similar success.","tags":["Business","Project & Product Management","Product Management","Customer Experience"]},{"id":"9781565920033","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"X Toolkit Intrinsics Programming Manual for Version 11 Volume 4, 3rd Edition","authors":["Adrian Nye","Tim O'Reilly"],"pages":"622","publication_date":"January 1990","description":"Volume 4 is a complete guide to programming with the X Toolkit Intrinsics, the library of C language routines that facilitates the design of user interfaces with reusable components called widgets.

Ideally, premises give an audience good reasons for accepting your argument’s conclusion. In marketing, these “conclusions” are normative decisions about what an organization should do, for example, raise prices by five percent, add a new sales territory or, perhaps, change the marketing communications mix to invest more in digital and less in print. The premises are the rationale behind why the organization should take such actions. Critical Thinking for Marketers: Learn How to Think, Not What to Think provides information and guidelines on not only how to develop good arguments, but also what it means to develop a good argument. For example, the book describes two basic kinds of arguments—deductive and inductive—and how to examine whether such arguments are “good” or not. To do this, the book explains 60 logical fallacies—or errors in reasoning—that marketers should avoid. Additionally, the authors’ several “Think Better” discussions examine how fields such as philosophy, behavioral economics, and marketing theory have informed the principles of critical thinking in marketing.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Development","Critical Thinking"]},{"id":"9781633692039","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Succeeding Generations","authors":["Ivan Lansberg"],"pages":"400","publication_date":"July 1999","description":"Finding the right successor to a well-loved founder or president is often the most difficult task an organization can faceand the challenge can be even greater for family-run businesses.

Author Ivan Lansberg, an organizational psychologist who grew up in a family business, examines the reasons behind this high failure rate and reveals the factors that contribute to long-term success. He offers practical advice on how to mentor successors, how to set up a systematic selection process, and how to make the best use of the board of directors during times of transition.With a wealth of examples from companies in the United States, Europe, and Latin America, Succeeding Generations provides a thoughtful and comprehensive look at the sensitive dynamics of leadership succession in family businesses.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Culture in Business"]},{"id":"9780749438272","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Practical Facilitation","authors":["Christine Hogan"],"pages":"495","publication_date":"November 2005","description":"This toolkit of facilitation techniques should provide readers with all they need to develop and hone their facilitation skills.

It doesn't have to be this way!\n\nThe people you work with may be from a different generation, different culture, different race, different gender, or just a different philosophy toward work and life in general, but you need to work together toward a common goal. How to Work With and Lead People Not Like You explains how to dial down the differences, smooth out the friction, and play upon each other's strengths to become more effective, more productive, and less stressed. The keys are to find the common ground and identify hidden conflicts that are hurting productivity.\n\nMany people shudder at the prospect of working with diverse groups of people, but they can't voice their fear or anxiety. At work, it's not OK or politically correct to say, 'I'm uncomfortable with this person.' In fact, if you do say something along those lines, your job may be at risk. Your company may terminate you for not being on the 'diversity bandwagon.' So you keep quiet and you keep your thoughts to yourself. But deep down, you are uncomfortable.\n\nIf you feel like this, it doesn't mean you're racist, sexist, ageist, homophobic, or any other negative label. It means you're struggling.\n\nYou're struggling to understand people, cultures, or values that are unfamiliar to you. You're struggling to do your job with teammates and coworkers who may have very different viewpoints or different approaches to communication than you have. You're struggling to overcome differences and pull together to achieve high performance at work.\n\nWhether you're leading a diverse team, working in a challenging cross-cultural environment, or simply working with people who are 'not like you,' you need to be able to get along with everyone as a team, to get the work done. This book explains the skills you need to communicate, motivate, and inspire people to collaborate—even if they have very different values, lifestyles, or priorities.\n\nLearn key steps that bring cohesion to diversity\nHow to have a constructive conversation about working alongside people who are different\nThe four magic words that make this easier and smooth over friction\nWhat not to say—and why\nLearn to set aside differences and get things done\nLearn how to handle a racist, sexist, homophobic or offensive remark in a professional way\nRetain your sanity when colleagues drive you crazy\n\nThe changing demographics of today's workforce bring conflicting viewpoints, perspectives, approaches, skills, habits, and personalities together in one place; whether that leads to synergy or catastrophe is up to you. How to Work With and Lead People Not Like You helps you turn a hurdle into an advantage so you or your team can do more, achieve more, and enjoy the ride.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Culture in Business"]},{"id":"9780768687835","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Zoho 4 Everyone","authors":["Nancy Conner"],"pages":"432","publication_date":"December 2008","description":"Forget the hassles and cost of old-fashioned office and business software: Now, you can do everything online with Zoho!

There may be no greater waste of a company’s resources. The ultimate cost: neither the organization nor its people are able to realize their full potential. What if a company did everything in its power to create a culture in which everyone—not just select “high potentials”—could overcome their own internal barriers to change and use errors and vulnerabilities as prime opportunities for personal and company growth?Robert Kegan and Lisa Lahey (and their collaborators) have found and studied such companies—Deliberately Developmental Organizations. A DDO is organized around the simple but radical conviction that organizations will best prosper when they are more deeply aligned with people’s strongest motive, which is to grow. This means going beyond consigning “people development” to high-potential programs, executive coaching, or once-a-year off-sites. It means fashioning an organizational culture in which support of people’s development is woven into the daily fabric of working life and the company’s regular operations, daily routines, and conversations.An Everyone Culture dives deep into the worlds of three leading companies that embody this breakthrough approach. It reveals the design principles, concrete practices, and underlying science at the heart of DDOs—from their disciplined approach to giving feedback, to how they use meetings, to the distinctive way that managers and leaders define their roles. The authors then show readers how to build this developmental culture in their own organizations.This book demonstrates a whole new way of being at work. It suggests that the culture you create is your strategy—and that the key to success is developing everyone.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Culture in Business"]},{"id":"9781789665697","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Cryptocurrency Revolution","authors":["Rhian Lewis"],"pages":"280","publication_date":"October 2020","description":"Understand the potential challenges and transformative opportunities of cryptocurrencies and blockchains.","tags":["Software Development","Blockchain / Decentralized Apps","Blockchain","Cryptocurrency"]},{"id":"9781789667882","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Power of Customer Experience","authors":["Martin Newman"],"pages":"264","publication_date":"May 2021","description":"Refocus on the customer to outstrip your competition and increase profitability, with invaluable insight into the direct correlation between customer-centricity and shareholder value, proven by today's most successful companies.","tags":["Business","Project & Product Management","Product Management","Customer Experience"]},{"id":"9781398614536","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Think Human","authors":["Olivier Duha"],"pages":"224","publication_date":"January 2024","description":"Maximize customer satisfaction by transforming your customer relations into a key strategic resource, learning how to effectively utilize technology as well as the human touch to create a winning customer experience.","tags":["Business","Project & Product Management","Product Management","Customer Experience"]},{"id":"9780814417904","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"High-Tech, High-Touch Customer Service","authors":["Micah Solomon"],"pages":"208","publication_date":"May 2012","description":"Today's customers are a hard bunch to crack.

The book proposes explanations for this, ranging from the wholly rational to the irrational, and analyzes different factors in decision-making, such as the intention of the decision-maker, the environment in which their decision is made or the process leading to decision-making.\n\nWhile the common belief is that everything in an industrial environment stems from reasoned decisions, analysis of common practice shows that this is not always the case. This book offers an original perspective by presenting the decision making mechanism from the point of view of the decision maker and their handling of a specific decision-making problem.\n\nTo learn more about the decision-maker’s motivations when faced with these situations, the authors provide a review of the history of decisionmaking and the major trends in decision-making theory. The concepts and methods are presented with illustrations based on the use of an MES, an industrial management software package.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Development","Critical Thinking"]},{"id":"9781647825102","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Never Not Working","authors":["Malissa Clark"],"pages":"224","publication_date":"February 2024","description":"The always-on, hustle culture creates an unhealthy, counterproductive relationship with work.\n\nMany workers believe that to compete with other top talent, they must embrace a culture that rewards long hours and a constant connection to work. Businesses and society endorse busyness, overwork, and extreme commitment as the most valued traits in workers. Sometimes that endorsement is explicit, as when Elon Musk told X/Twitter employees to work \"long hours at high intensity\" or get fired. More often it's an implicit contract, a buildup of organizational and cultural norms and the adoption of new technologies that make it easy to tether people to work.\n\nEither way, this workaholic behavior is unhealthy and counterproductive for workers and for organizations. It's time to fight back. Malissa Clark—a preeminent researcher on the culture of overwork—shows you how in Never Not Working. Clark examines overwork and burnout, not just from the individual's perspective but from an organizational perspective too. She delivers a comprehensive, nuanced definition of workaholism, busting myths along the way—working long hours, it turns out, doesn't automatically make you a workaholic. She also helps you assess whether you're falling prey to the phenomenon and whether you're creating workaholics in your organization.\n\nClark shows you how to escape the trap of putting work at the center of everything and thus losing your well-being—or your company's performance—in the process. Deeply researched and written for everyone from leaders to individual contributors, Never Not Working is the essential guide to identifying workaholism in yourself and others and starting on the road to recovery.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Culture in Business"]},{"id":"9781633697010","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Connected Strategy","authors":["Nicolaj Siggelkow","Christian Terwiesch"],"pages":"288","publication_date":"April 2019","description":"Business Models for Transforming Customer Relationships\n\nWhat if there were a way to turn occasional, sporadic transactions with customers into long-term, continuous relationships--while simultaneously driving dramatic improvements in operational efficiency? What if you could break your existing trade-offs between superior customer experience and low cost?\n\nThis is the promise of a connected strategy. New forms of connectivity--involving frequent, low-friction, customized interactions--mean that companies can now anticipate customer needs as they arise, or even before. Simultaneously, enabled by these technologies, companies can create new business models that deliver more value to customers.

At home, they often face an unequal division of household chores and childcare, and in the workplace, they deal with lower pay, lack of credit for their contributions, roadblocks to promotion, sexual harassment, and more. And while organizations are looking to address these issues, too many gender-inclusion initiatives focus on how women themselves should respond, reinforcing the perception that these are \"women's issues\" and that men—often the most influential stakeholders in an organization—don't need to be involved.\n\nGender-in-the-workplace experts David G. Smith and W. Brad Johnson counter this perception. In this important book, they show that men have a crucial role to play in promoting gender equality at work.

The main issue developed in this book is the connection between realistic and testable psychological features and the descriptive component of abstract axioms of rationality. It addresses three main topics for which the interaction between axiomatization and psychology leads to potential new developments in experimental decision-theory and puts strictures on the standard revealed preference methodology prevailing in that field. The possibility of a cardinal representation of preferences is discussed. Different ways of accounting for incomplete preferences, and in which sense, are analysed. Finally, the conditions of separability between preferences and beliefs, such as prescribed by axioms of state-independence, are submitted to actual and potential tests. The book offers a bridge between the disciplines of decision-theory, psychology, and neuroeconomics. It is thus relevant for those, in psychology and cognitive sciences, who are sometimes put off by the high degree of formalism and abstraction in decision-theory, that seems to lie beyond the reach of psychological realism. It also aims to convince those in decision-theory for whom psychological realism and empirical testability should not constrain the modelling enterprise that conceptual clarification can come from attempted experimentation.\n\nAddresses open and evolving theoretical issues in decision-theory, especially from experimental perspectives\nHelps researchers understand the psychological and neuroscientific mechanisms for decision-making\nConsiders how preferences shape beliefs and how beliefs shape preferences\nUncovers the very formal and abstract psychological and behavioral implications that are actually made in contemporary decision-theory","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Development","Critical Thinking"]},{"id":"9781941222607","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Cucumber Recipes","authors":["Ian Dees","Matt Wynne","Aslak Hellesoy"],"pages":"272","publication_date":"February 2013","description":"You can test just about anything with Cucumber.

It's time for men—and for all of us—to stand up and say, ‘Give us back our full humanity, give us back our dignity.'”—Paul Gilbert, PhD, author of The Compassionate Mind In a recent FiveThirtyEight poll, 60 percent of men surveyed said society puts pressure on men to behave in a way that is unhealthy or bad. Men account for 80 percent of suicides in the United States, and three in ten American men have suffered from depression. Ed Adams and Ed Frauenheim say a big part of the problem is a model of masculinity that's become outmoded and even dangerous, to both men and women. The conventional notion of what it means to be a man—what Adams and Frauenheim call “Confined Masculinity”—traps men in an emotional straitjacket; steers them toward selfishness, misogyny, and violence; and severely limits their possibilities. As an antidote, they propose a new paradigm: Liberating Masculinity. It builds on traditional masculine roles like the protector and provider, expanding men's options to include caring, collaboration, emotional expressivity, an inclusive spirit, and environmental stewardship. Through hopeful stories of men who have freed themselves from the strictures of Confined Masculinity, interviews with both leaders and everyday men, and practical exercises, this book shows the power of a masculinity defined by what the authors call the five Cs: curiosity, courage, compassion, connection, and commitment. Men will discover a way of being that fosters healthy, harmonious relationships at home, at work, and in the world.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Culture in Business"]},{"id":"9781626561038","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"The Multicultural Mind","authors":["David Thomas"],"pages":"176","publication_date":"February 2016","description":"Globalization has created a superheated competitive business environment that demands innovation to stay ahead.

But when the decisions are complex, business leaders tend to home in quickly on a couple of options, list the pros and cons, and spend the bulk of their time calculating — or deliberating about — how the competing courses of action stack up. They rarely take the time to frame decisions thoroughly or explore the full scope of options.\n\nUnfortunately, when decisions are framed this way, the authors contend, the outcome is frequently suboptimal. An effective way to work against this, they say, is to make better use of the classic decision matrix, which allows for the comparison of different options using the same set of predefined criteria. The authors argue that the decision matrix isn’t just an evaluation tool but also a process tool that can help executives extend their decision frame beyond the obvious options and criteria and help them think “out of the box.”\n\nAccording to the authors, the decision matrix can be useful at key stages in the decision-making process to (1) frame decisions, (2) make concrete choices, and (3) communicate solutions. It allows leaders to identify potential gaps and logical flaws in their reasoning, facilitate dialogue in the executive team, and build support and buy-in in the wider organization. To expand the decision frame in a systematic way, the authors note, executives should understand two concepts: mental buckets and golden cuts.\n\nMental buckets are vehicles for clustering similar ideas into related yet distinct categories. While brainstorming is a common way for teams to generate lots of ideas, ideas need to be organized at some point. Categorizing them into mental buckets helps people spot gaps and overlaps — in terms of both options and criteria. The cognitive act of creating new mental buckets serves to stimulate creativity.\n\nThe golden cut is a term the authors use to describe the most difficult trade-off in any decision. To find the golden cut, decision makers may need to reframe the problem by moving either up or down a level to identify the underlying tension. Identifying the golden cut is vital not just for framing decisions but also for engaging with key stakeholders. Being mindful about choosing and communicating the first cut on the criteria dimension is likely to create more openness and willingness to engage; the relevant criteria will be highlighted at the beginning rather than as an afterthought.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Development","Critical Thinking"]},{"id":"9780735625945","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Programming Microsoft Dynamics® CRM 4.0","authors":["Jim Steger Mike Snyder Brad Bosak, Corey O’Brien, and Phil Richardson"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"October 2008","description":"Get answers to common questions about setting up the design environment and building custom solutions with Microsoft Dynamics CRM.

Love is not only appropriate in the context of business, it’s the foundation of great leadership. To put it bluntly: love is just damn good business. That’s the simple but profound truth that leadership consultant Steve Farber has discovered in his extensive work with Fortune 100 companies and other successful businesses. His game-changing approach to love as a practical business strategy will help you to: • Identify your passions—and share them with others • Create a culture of love at work—and spark innovation, productivity, and joy • Serve your customers, so they love how you treat them—and have them coming back for more • Invest time in making personal connections—that are mutually rewarding • Focus on serving the needs of others—they’re going to love it • Do what you love—and make it your business, so others love it, too The proven principles you’ll find in this book will help you lay the groundwork for a thriving, competitive enterprise. When love is part of your organization’s framework and operationalized in its culture, employees and customers feel genuinely valued. Employees who are passionate about the work that they do are more loyal, innovative, creative, and inspired, and that translates to great customer experience. They don’t serve others out of obligation, but because of a genuine desire to improve people’s lives. And when customers reciprocate by loving your products, your services, and your people, that’s when something great happens. That’s when you get loyalty. That’s when you get raving fans. It’s a refreshingly human way of doing business. In addition to Farber’s field-tested strategies, you’ll find inspiring case studies from a wide range of industries and leaders, revealing self-assessment quizzes, and practical pointers on how to build a corporate culture based on love, the ultimate competitive advantage.

Washington asks company leaders, and often she hears about an ideal vision of an organization that values diversity and inclusion and wants employees to bring their whole selves to work.\n\nBut how can you get there? Organizations have largely missed the mark when it comes to creating environments where all employees thrive in an equal and equitable way, because they treat diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) as a program that gets done rather than the necessary and difficult journey it is. A truly inclusive workplace requires invention and reinvention, mistakes and humility, adaptation to a changing world, constant reflection, and sometimes significant sacrifice.\n\nThe road to an inclusive workplace is a difficult one, but you can traverse it, and there's help along the way. Start here with stories of companies making the necessary journey, including Slack, PwC, Best Buy, Denny's, and many others. Hear from company leaders about their successes and failures, the times they were on the vanguard, and the moments they realized they had much more work to do. These are profiles in perseverance from people who are keen enough to recognize the need for inclusive workplaces and humble enough to know they're not there yet. Along the way, Washington provides a framework for thinking about where these companies are on their journeys and where you and your company may be too.\n\nProgress is hard won on the necessary journey to becoming an inclusive organization, but it must be won.

The fate of any change effort depends on whether and how leaders engage their culture: the self-sustaining patterns of behaving, feeling, thinking, and believing that determine how things are done in an organization. Culture is implicit rather than explicit, emotional rather than rational--that's what makes it so hard to work with, but that's also what makes it so powerful. For the first time, this book lays out the Katzenbach Center's proven methodology for identifying your culture's four most critical elements: traits, characteristics that are at the heart of people's emotional connection to what they do; keystone behaviors, actions that would lead your company to succeed if they were replicated at a greater scale; authentic informal leaders, people who have a high degree of \"emotional intuition\" or social connectedness; and metrics, integrated, thoughtful measures to track progress, encourage the self-reinforcing cycle of lasting change and link to business performance. By leveraging these critical few elements, you can tap into a source of catalytic change within your organization. People will make an emotional, not just a rational, commitment to new initiatives. You will elicit enthusiasm and creativity and build the kind of powerful company that people recognize for its innate value and effectiveness.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Culture in Business"]},{"id":"9780132682084","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 Unleashed","authors":["Marc Wolenik","Damian Sinay","Rajya Bhaiya"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"September 2011","description":"Microsoft® Dynamics CRM 2011 Unleashed presents start-to-finish guidance for planning, customizing, deploying, integrating, managing, and securing the newest version of Dynamics CRM.

But when your company’s performance runs short of what you’ve promised, customers can seize control of your brand message, spreading their disappointment and frustration faster than you can keep up.\n\nTo keep pace with today’s connected customers, your company must become a connected company. That means deeply engaging with workers, partners, and customers, changing how work is done, how you measure success, and how performance is rewarded. It requires a new way of thinking about your company: less like a machine to be controlled, and more like a complex, dynamic system that can learn and adapt over time.\n\nConnected companies have the advantage, because they learn and move faster than their competitors. While others work in isolation, they link into rich networks of possibility and expand their influence.\n\nConnected companies around the world are aggressively acquiring customers and disrupting the competition.

To extend their capabilities and facilitate change, many organizations have experimented with different types of strategic partnerships with suppliers and customers that help them design and deliver products and services efficiently. But some innovative companies are attempting to redefine the parameters of strategic partnerships through multileveled relationships with customers and suppliers that leverage the resources and capabilities of the respective parties. What makes such partnerships — which the author calls adaptive strategic partnerships — counterintuitive is that they are being used in situations where the two most relevant streams of organizational economics would argue for vertical integration. One company that has pursued adaptive strategic partnerships is Bharti Airtel Ltd., the Indian telecommunications services company. Back in 2004, Bharti Airtel’s managers found that negotiating and updating contracts with vendors interfered with their ability to focus on satisfying the company’s customers and outsmarting its competition. Contrary to what other telecom operators have done, it negotiated unconventional relationships with some of its leading vendors, including Nokia Siemens Networks (now Nokia Solutions and Networks), Ericsson and IBM. Instead of expanding network infrastructure by purchasing increasing amounts of equipment (such as exchanges and cellular antennas), which often results in unused capacity, Bharti Airtel pays the vendors to operate the network; it compensates them based on telecom volume, paying only when equipment is in use. In addition to rethinking its approach to network capacity, vendors take responsibility for network performance and troubleshooting. Typically, companies with outside partners rely on simple tools such as service-level agreements, which specify what is expected from each party and provide for performance standards to assess compliance. But in managing its partnerships with vendors, Bharti Airtel uses a joint governing structure that encourages people at different levels of the organizations to communicate and address problems as they arise (for example, restoring service after a severe storm). In some cases, such interactions have led the company and its partners to redraw the scope of their collaborations (for example, assign responsibility for building and maintaining the cell towers to a new company), something that would be more difficult to do in a more traditional partnership. With flexible contracts, the companies can adapt to shifts in competitive environment and implementation challenges. The incentive system rewards vendors for efficient network management. By sharing information with its telecom equipment providers, Bharti Airtel and its partners are incentivized to develop processes that advance learning, innovation and mutual trust. Like Bharti Airtel, other companies are shifting the institutional framework on three dimensions: (1) incentives, (2) information, and (3) collaboration mechanisms. By managing across these dimensions, they are paving the way for the new level of collaboration.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Corporate Valuation"]},{"id":"53863MIT60221","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Public Sector Can Teach Us A Lot About Digitizing Customer Service","authors":["Nili Alireza","Alistair Barros","Mary Tate"],"pages":"6","publication_date":"January 2019","description":"Digital customer service agents (known as virtual assistants, chatbots, or softbots) are typically used to sift through and process only the most straightforward customer inquiries, such as requests for basic information.

Recently promoted to head his division, he's delivered two years of divisional losses in clients, market share, and profits. He knows his workers are talented and creative, but they don't respond to his efforts to lead them, and he's on the brink of being fired. In desperation, he reaches out to an old mentor, David Butler, who now works with wild mustang horses and hard-to-place foster children on a ranch in Colorado. David agrees to work with his former student but only on the condition that Matt comes to him—to the ranch. Matt has no idea what the ranch could possibly have to do with his problems, but David assures him that if he spends some time there, he'll learn exactly what he needs to know. Through David's unorthodox tutelage, Matt discovers that leaders who succeed in engaging their workers do so because they see their day-to-day work as an opportunity to build an organizational culture of engagement. The engagement model is illuminated as Matt comes to understand its components piece by piece—and ultimately discovers how to engage those on his team and in his life.In this inspiring leadership fable, John Stahl-Wert and Ken Jennings draw on their years of experience as consultants and chief executives, as well as on findings from Gallup's groundbreaking Q12 survey of 4 million workers from 360,000 workgroups, to lay out an innovative leadership model that will turn employees from dutiful drones to committed contributors. But Ten Thousand Horses is also a story of personal transformation. Beyond specific practices and techniques, Matt must learn a whole new way of relating to his employees—because, as he discovers, leading an engaged workforce is as much about who you are as what you do.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Culture in Business"]},{"id":"9781118662670","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Delivering Effective Social Customer Service: How to Redefine the Way You Manage Customer Experience and Your Corporate Reputation","authors":["Martin Hill-Wilson","Carolyn Blunt"],"pages":"250","publication_date":"November 2013","description":"Social Customer Service is new.

When Bachelder was named CEO of Popeyes in the fall of 2007, guest visits had been declining for years, restaurant sales and profit trends were negative, and the company stock price had dropped from $34 in 2002 to $13. The brand was stagnant, and relations between the company and its franchise owners were strained. By 2014, average restaurant sales were up 25 percent, and profits were up 40 percent. Popeyes' market share had grown from 14 percent to 21 percent, and the stock price was over $40. The franchisees were so pleased with the turnaround that they began reinvesting in the brand, rapidly remodeling restaurants, and building new units around the world. The difference maker, Bachelder says, was a conscious decision to lead in a new way. She and her team created a workplace where people were treated with respect and dignity yet challenged to perform at the highest level. Silos and self were set aside in favor of collaboration and team play. And the results were measured with rigor and discipline. Servant leadership is sometimes derided as soft or ineffective, but this book shows that it's actually challenging and tough minded—a daring path. Bachelder takes you firsthand through the transformation of Popeyes and shows how a leader at any level can become a Dare-to-Serve leader.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Culture in Business"]},{"id":"9780132120081","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"When You and Your Customers Make the Products Together","authors":["Juliette Powell"],"pages":"10","publication_date":"June 2010","description":"This Element is an excerpt from 33 Million People in the Room: How to Create, Influence, and Run a Successful Business with Social Networking (9780137154357) by Juliette Powell.

They also work closely with their suppliers in an effort to offer greater functionality and performance for their customers. However, some critical new product insights don’t come from suppliers and customers working together but from the customer’s customers. When suppliers and customers cooperate, the authors write, they can “tweak” the technology to provide big gains in value for the customer’s customers. In contrast to recent research on how suppliers and customers cooperate to save on costs, the authors examine the innovation process to understand how to achieve outcomes for the end user that otherwise would not occur. Drawing on numerous examples from technology companies, they look at how suppliers and customers become open to tweaking the supplier’s offering to better serve the customer’s customers; what makes for successful tweaking; and various ways parties can share the fruits of collaboration so that everyone benefits.Although some progressive suppliers and customers saw the potential benefits of working together, many of the businesses the authors examined regarded this kind of cooperation as a last resort. Small suppliers saw large prospective customers as slow to make decisions and overly aggressive about claiming intellectual property that came out of collaborations; large customers also tended to withhold information about how they used the suppliers’ technologies and their customers’ applications. However, the authors found that some technology businesses consciously seek opportunities to cooperate with their customers and customer’s customers. This was particularly true with small and medium-sized companies. The authors explore two key issues: the extent to which contact between the supplier and the customer’s customer needs to be direct; and how businesses bridge across different partial understandings to improve their chances of success. Although being able to interact with the customer’s customer directly is desirable in many instances, the authors found that businesses that aren’t able to arrange for this can compensate. The authors also found that by working together with their customers and the customer’s customers, some suppliers identified new business models that made their offerings more valuable.","tags":["Business","Project & Product Management","Product Management","Customer Experience"]},{"id":"9780133039740","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"The Death of Corporate Reputation: How Integrity Has Been Destroyed on Wall Street","authors":["Jonathan R. Macey"],"pages":"304","publication_date":"March 2013","description":"Why did the financial scandals really happen? Why are they continuing to happen? In The Death of Corporate Reputation, Yale's Jonathan Macey reveals the real, non-intuitive reason, and offers a new path forward. For over a century law firms, investment banks, accounting firms, credit rating agencies and companies seeking regular access to U.S. capital markets made large investments in their reputations.  They treated customers well and sometimes endured losses in transactions or business deals in order to sustain and nurture their reputations as faithful brokers and “gate-keepers.”  This has changed completely. The existing business model among leading participants in today’s capital markets no longer treats customers as valued clients whose trust must be earned and nurtured, but as one-off “counter-parties” to whom no duties are owed and no loyalty is required.  The rough and tumble norms of the market-place have replaced the long-standing reputational model in U.S. finance. \n\nThis book describes the transformation inAmerican financefrom the old reputational model to the existing laissez faire model and argues that the change came as a result of threefactors: (1) the growth of reliance on regulation rather than reputation as the primary mechanism for protecting customers and (2) the increasing complexity of regulation, which made technical expertise rather than reputation the primary criterion on which customers choose who to do business with in today’s markets; and (3) the rise of the “cult of personality” on Wall Street, which has led to a secular demise in the relevance of companies’ reputations and the concomitant rise of individual “rain-makers” reputation as the basis for premium pricing of financial services.This compelling book will drive the debate about the financial crisis and financial regulation for years to come--both inside and outside the industry.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Corporate Valuation"]},{"id":"9781422171967","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Harvard Business Review on Increasing Customer Loyalty","authors":["Harvard Business Review"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"February 2011","description":"How do you keep your customers coming back-and get them to bring others?If you need the best practices and ideas for making your customers loyal and profitable--but don't have time to find them--this book is for you.

When employees can't speak truth to power, senior leaders don't hear what they need to hear about their company's fitness to compete, and employees lose trust in those leaders and become less committed to change.\n\nIn Fit to Compete, Beer presents an antidote to silence--principles and a time-tested innovative process for holding honest conversations with everyone in your organization. Used by over eight hundred organizations across the globe, the strategic fitness process has helped leaders in a diverse range of industries--including medical technology, information technology, banking, restaurant chains, and pharmaceuticals--hear the raw but necessary truth about the sources of misalignment between their strategies and their organizations.\n\nIn addition to step-by-step instructions, Beer offers detailed and illustrative case studies of companies that have conducted honest conversations to great effect. He also shows how to apply the process more broadly to a variety of strategic challenges and at multiple levels throughout the organization.\n\nPractical, enlightening, and comprehensive, Fit to Compete is the book you should turn to if you to want create winning strategies that your entire company will rally behind.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Culture in Business"]},{"id":"9781782172796","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Learning Force.com Application Development","authors":["Chamil Madusanka"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"April 2015","description":"Learning Force.com Application Development empowers you to build robust and scalable applications using the Salesforce.com platform.

Inspired by pioneering work by Dr. Neale Martin, Sprint and Samsung created the Instinct interface from the bottom up to work the way your brain works.”\n\n—Doug Rossier, Sprint Instinct Marketing Lead\n\n“In Habit, Neale Martin provides what seems to be a simple observation—that human behavior is largely managed through subconscious process. In startling fashion, Martin makes this point and then proceeds to undermine much of what marketers have come to believe as absolute truths. This is a worthwhile read, with significant implications to anyone who hopes to build brands and sell products.”\n\n—John Stratton, Sr. Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer of Verizon\n\n“Neale provides some of the most comprehensive insights into marketing I have ever read. His understanding of today’s market complexity is simply brilliant.”\n\n—Derek Broes, Sr. Vice President, Paramount\n\n“At last someone has approached marketing with the clarity and precision of a brain surgeon.”\n\n—George Ford, Marketing Director, Petrafoods\n\n“Habit reveals why traditional approaches to acquiring and keeping customers don’t work anymore. Dr. Martin shows that by focusing on behavior instead of attitudes and intentions, companies can radically improve not only how many customers they win, but how many they keep.”\n\n—S. Somasegar, Microsoft Senior Vice President, Developer Division\n\n“Habit is an essential read for all marketers, managers and executives. Dr. Martin has elevated the seemingly boring concept of habits to a science with implications for every business in every market. This excellent book not only explains why consumers behave the way they do, but what companies should do in light of these startling insights!”\n\n—Jagdish N. Sheth, Ph.D, Charles H. Kellstadt  Professor of Marketing, Goizueta Business School,  Emory University\n\nHabit begins with a revolutionary premise—95% of human behavior is controlled by the unconscious mind. This fact exposes the central flaw in marketing theory, market research, and a preponderance of business strategy—that customers are consciously aware of what they’re doing. Habit explains why 80% of new products fail, why billions of advertising dollars are wasted every year, and why even satisfied customers aren’t loyal.\n\nIn Habit, Dr. Neale Martin persuasively contends that recent research from the brain sciences reveals that our brain evolved two minds—and marketing is focused on the wrong one. By explaining how the mind actually works, Martin shows how 50 years of marketing theory is deeply flawed, and how your customers’ habits thwart even your costliest marketing campaigns.\n\nHabit explains in practical terms how to work with both your customers’ executive and habitual minds to not only make sales but more importantly, create loyalty. You’ll discover how behavior actually rewires your customers' mind—and how to leverage this by refocusing on behavior, not on attitudes and beliefs.\n\nMartin offers a complete process for working with customers’ unconscious and conscious minds together, to become your customer’s habit, not just their choice. Using these techniques, you can finally achieve the twin holy grails of marketing: higher customer retention, and greater long-term profitability. \n\nWhy focusing on customer satisfaction is a waste of time Prioritizing customer satisfaction ignores a crucial reality: 85% of customers who defect report being satisfied!\n\nHow to establish a beachhead in your potential customer’s unconscious Teach new buying habits through cause and effect, reward and repetition\n\nWhy you should keep your regular customers from thinking about you Learn how to keep repurchase behavior on permanent autopilot\n\nwww.nealemartin.com","tags":["Business","Project & Product Management","Product Management","Customer Experience"]},{"id":"9781576755822","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"A Complaint Is a Gift, 2nd Edition","authors":["Janelle Barlow","Claus Møller"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"August 2008","description":"The first edition of A Complaint Is a Gift introduced the revolutionary notion that customer complaints are not annoyances to be dodged, denied, or buried but are instead valuable pieces of feedback – in fact, they’re your best bargain in market research.

Complaints provide a feedback mechanism that can help organizations rapidly and inexpensively strengthen products, service style, and market focus. Most importantly, complaints create a moment of truth when a customer who is deciding whether to return can be made even more loyal.\n\nUsing numerous real-life examples, A Complaint Is a Gift shows precisely how to handle complaints in a way that brings benefit to your organization and satisfaction to your customers – even when you have to say no.

In addition, the authors display great insight into what made Andersen great and the changes that led it to fail, while also raising serious questions about the remaining accounting firms and whether they understand how they must change to survive.

And it‘s written by people who not only drew the map, but blazed these trails in the first place.” –Brian Collins, Executive Creative Director, Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide Brand Integration Group In a market economy characterized by commoditized products and global competition, how do companies gain deep and lasting loyalty from their customers? The key, this book argues, is in providing meaningful customer experiences. Writing in the tradition of Louis Cheskin, one of the founding fathers of market research, the authors of Making Meaning observe, define, and describe the meaningful customer experience. By consciously evoking certain deeply valued meanings through their products, services, and multidimensional customer experiences, they argue, companies can create more value and achieve lasting strategic advantages over their competitors. A few businesses are already discovering this approach, but until now no one has articulated it in such a persuasive and practical way. Making Meaning not only encourages businesses to adopt an innovation process that’s centered on meaning, it also tells you how. The book outlines a plan of action and describes the attributes of a meaning-centric innovation team. With insightful real-world examples drawn from the Cheskin company's experience and from the authors' observations of the contemporary global market, this book outlines a plan of action and describes the attributes of a meaning-centric innovation team. Meaningful experiences—as distinct from trivial ones—reinforce or transform the customer’s sense of purpose and significance. The authors’ vision of a world of meaningful consumption is idealistic, but don’t be fooled: this is a straightforward business book with an eye on the ROI.

This book reviews the literature and results of an empirical study that investigated the relationship between mechanistic and organic cultures and the level of trust in technology-based organizations.\n\nThe book outlines the literature on organizational trust and culture and the role theorists believe they play in the success of a changing domestic and global business environment. It identifies ways of defining culture and trust as well as the survey instruments used to measure them. The book then examines the results of two studies that demonstrate the connection between organizational culture and trust. The two studies were conducted at separate times using data collected from several companies within a three-hour radius of each other. These companies are highly dependent upon the ability to identify, hire, and retain highly skilled knowledge workers.

This book aims to review this concept and show how it leads to the creation of value and new business opportunities.\n\nChapter 1 is based on four examples: the online-banking sector, an informative television channel, the postal sector and the higher education sector. It shows that in the current context, for a company facing challenges, the crowd remains an untapped resource. The next chapter presents crowdsourcing as a new form of externalization and offers definitions of crowdsourcing. In Chapter 3, the authors attempt to explain how a company can create value by means of a crowdsourcing operation. To do this, authors use a model linking types of value, types of crowd, and the means by which these crowds are accessed.\n\nChapter 4 examines in detail various forms that crowdsourcing may take, by presenting and discussing ten types of crowdsourcing operation. In Chapter 5, the authors imagine and explore the ways in which the dark side of crowdsourcing might be manifested and Chapter 6 offers some insight into the future of crowdsourcing.\n\nContents\n\n1.

In particular, a growing number of service organizations have been investigating the use of a sophisticated linear programming technique called DEA, or data envelopment analysis. (In this article, the authors use the term “balanced benchmarking” to denote DEA.) The technique enables companies to benchmark and locate best practices that are not visible through other commonly used management methodologies.Today, balanced benchmarking can be used by anyone with Microsoft Excel, but it was not always so easy. When it was first introduced in the 1980s, balanced benchmarking was an academic tool for measuring and managing relative efficiency of peer organizations.Balanced benchmarking simultaneously considers the multiple resources used to generate multiple services, along with the quality of the services provided. It also provides managers with a sophisticated mechanism to assess the performance of different service providers — comparing, for example, the London and Tokyo offices of a global advertising agency — by going well beyond crude metrics and ratios such as profitability and account billings per employee. A company can identify its least efficient offices or business units, and it can assess the magnitude of the inefficiency and investigate potential paths for improvement. Moreover, executives can study the top-performing units, identify the best practices and transfer that valuable knowledge throughout the organization. Lastly, balanced benchmarking enables companies to test their assumptions, particularly before implementing initiatives that might inadvertently be counterproductive.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Sales","Customer Service"]},{"id":"9781599962559","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"54 Golden Nuggets: The Best of the Telephone Doctor","authors":["Nancy Friedman The Telephone Doctor"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"January 2011","description":"The compilation of 54 articles covers all aspects of customer service and are organized into four easy-to-reference sections: Customer service, telephone service, human resources tips and voice mail/e-mail/cell phone tips.

The brand was stagnant, the team was discouraged, and the franchisees were just plain angry. Nine years later, restaurant sales were up 45 percent, restaurant profits had doubled, and the stock price was over $61. Servant leadership is sometimes derided as soft or ineffective, but this book confirms that challenging people to reach a daring destination, while treating them with dignity, creates the conditions for superior performance. The second edition of this bestselling book includes Bachelder's post-Popeyes observations and new examples of how you can switch your leadership from self to serve.

Johnson"],"pages":"488","publication_date":"November 2001","description":"'Shareholder Value' presents a powerful and useful toolkit of market-based perspectives, analytic approaches, valuation techniques, and specific financial metrics for use in everyday business life. The author helps a broad spectrum of professionals understand the salient points and real world implications of a 'value management' movement which has taken hold in many corporations in the United States and around the world. This movement is being supported by some of the major institutional investors who influence financial markets.The main goal of 'Shareholder Value' is to help working professionals grasp the concept of value 'creators' and 'destroyers', along with the implications. He also provides tools to measure the success (or failure) of major strategic and operational initiatives and enables corporate managers to understand how shareholder value is created, and then directs behaviour toward 'value-based' planning and action.Although mainly aimed at the professional market, 'Shareholder Value' will also be of use to students of business and finance as it is intended to provide a comprehensive foundation for important elements of business strategy and acquisition valuation, corporate financial analysis, capital investments, corporate financing and economic value based metrics.AUTHOR'S REVIEW:When developing this book, I strived to achieve the following:* Provide the finance professional and student of finance with a comprehensive template of shareholder value concepts and techniques - geared toward use in a corporate setting.* Give the non-financial professional an understanding of the underpinnings and behavioural aspects of economic value management.* Outline and provide details of an effective process for implementing a value-based financial performance system within a corporation.* ...And, combine learning with enjoyable reading by presenting technical material through a story.The \"story\" and \"characters\" are unique features of Shareholder Value - A Business Experience. The reader can get an appreciation of the environment surrounding value-based management, along with challenges that arise when transitioning from traditional \"accounting\" performance (where earnings and earnings per share reign supreme) to \"economic\" performance (where cash flow and return on investment are emphasized). Characters occupying operating and staff roles have been created to represent people that those working inside companies (large, medium and small) may encounter and, also, to invoke some humour. Insights into how to function in different corporate roles can be gained by following the characters through the story.Presents a combination of analysis and case study in which a strong technical treatment is blended with a fictional case study to offer clarity and explanationA practical and effective implementation process for a comprehensive financial performance systemOffers a perspective of the role of different corporate and business unit functions in the implementation of value-based financial performance within a company","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Corporate Valuation"]},{"id":"9781633692800","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Simply Better","authors":["Patrick Barwise","Sean Meehan"],"pages":"240","publication_date":"August 2004","description":"Most executives believe that winning and keeping customers requires offering something unique. But as physical products are seen as increasingly hard to differentiate, companies resort to branding, gimmicks, and thinking outside the box.” Meanwhile, customers are less satisfied than they were a decade ago.Patrick Barwise and Seán Meehan argue that most companies have taken differentiation so far that they’ve left their customers behind. Customers don’t want bells and whistles and don’t care about trivial differences between brands. What they really want are quality products, reliable services, and fair value for money. Yet most companies consistently fail to meet these basic customer needs.Simply Better is a no-nonsense, back-to-basics manifesto for today’s businesses. Barwise and Meehan argue that successful differentiation lies not in unique selling propositions, but in generic category benefits, such as good service, on-time delivery, and quality products, that any company can provide. The key is to deliver these consistently better than competitors. Illustrating this customer-focused differentiation through vivid examples of companies, including Toyota, P&G, Hilti, Tesco, and Ryanair, Simply Better outlines an actionable framework managers can use to: Understand what customers really value and why they buy the brands they do Discover basic, unmet needs ripe for reliable solutions Channel customer dissatisfaction into performance improvements Balance in-the-box thinking in strategy and innovation with out-of-the-box thinking in advertising and communications Create a learning culture that continuously responds to changing customer needsWhile being unique might be exciting and appealing, it doesn’t drive business success. Simply Better shows how meeting and exceeding the most ordinary of customer expectations can lead to extraordinaryand lastingrewards.","tags":["Business","Project & Product Management","Product Management","Customer Experience"]},{"id":"9781606491201","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Successful Cross-Cultural Management","authors":["Parissa Haghirian"],"pages":"179","publication_date":"January 2012","description":"This book outlines the particulars of cross-cultural management and is a guidebook for international managers.

In recent years, social media and online ratings have given businesses new ways to learn about customers’ opinions about their products. Today, however, some of the products themselves -- at least those devices that are part of the connected world of the Internet of Things -- are starting to provide unprecedented levels of information that can be used to improve both the products and the customer experience.\n\nIn particular, information from connected devices offers companies three tremendously important core pieces of contextual information that were previously unavailable: where the products are being used, how they are being used, and which customers are using them at any given time. Going forward, the authors expect that companies that manufacture smart, connected products will have an advantage in the market.\n\nFor instance, a company does not have to wait until a customer calls with a complaint to know that a product connected to the Internet of Things is not working correctly; the product has already communicated the information. With this advance knowledge, the company can report an issue to a customer and seek to address it before it becomes a bigger problem. This service call could also turn into a sales call if the company adds a new feature that gives the product additional capabilities.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Sales","Customer Service"]},{"id":"9781604913101","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Leadership in Action: Dividends and Interest - The Pleasure and pains of Writing this Column","authors":["Craig Chappelow"],"pages":"2","publication_date":"February 2005","description":"Sometimes the stories closest to home are the most absorbing.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Communication","Creative Writing"]},{"id":"9781606495995","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Making Sense of Iranian Society, Culture, and Business","authors":["Dr. K.H.

In fact, recognizing difference as a positive force can bring astonishing value to even the most diverse organizations.In Us Plus Them, leadership scholar Todd Pittinsky introduces a groundbreaking new science of diversity that: Debunks the assumption that wherever there is difference there will be inherent tension and animosity Challenges the effectiveness of our standard attempts to fight prejudice and combat hate in our schools and workplaces, our civic and religious lives Reveals how we benefit from the mixing of different ethnic, racial, national, social, and religious groups in a globalized worldThrough a wide range of examplesfrom Maine and Michigan to Rwanda and Bhutan, and from small-town classrooms to corporate boardroomsPittinsky opens our eyes to misunderstood yet useful aspects of us-and-them relations, including many of the neglected positive dimensions of difference. He provides a bold new assessment of the popular and scientific approaches to the issue, proving that it’s time to move beyond mere tolerance to build communities in which the two sides of the us-and-them equation engage each other because they both want to.Much as Martin Seligman and positive psychology have shifted the focus from mental illness to mental healthiness, this book shifts our mind-set to diversity as a positive force. Understanding the science and practical use of that energy will help us build the schools, neighborhoods, companies, and nations we want, and not simply avoid the ugliest problems of the past. Pittinsky shows us that our great diversity experiment hasn’t failedit hasn’t even begun.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Culture in Business"]},{"id":"9781606497999","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Fostering Creativity in Self and the Organization","authors":["Eric W.

Without enough “brain power,” multinationals can’t succeed in these markets. Yet they’re approaching the war in the wrong way—bringing in expats and engaging in bidding wars for hotshot local “male” managers. The solution is hiding in plain sight: the millions of highly educated women surging into the labor markets of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and the United Arab Emirates. Increasingly, these women boast better credentials, higher ambitions, and greater loyalty than their male peers.But there’s a catch: Attracting and retaining talented women in emerging economies requires different strategies than those used in mature markets. Complex cultural forces – family-related “pulls,” such as daughterly duties to parents and in-laws, and work-related “pushes,” such as extreme hours and dangerous commutes – force women to settle for dead-end jobs, switch to the public sector, or leave the workforce entirely.In Winning the War for Talent in Emerging Markets, Sylvia Ann Hewlett and Ripa Rashid analyze these forces and present strategies for countering them, including:• Sustaining ambition through stretch opportunities and international assignments• Combating cultural bias by building an infrastructure for female leadership (networks, mentors, sponsors)• Introducing flexible work arrangements to accommodate family obligations• Providing safe transportation, such as employer-subsidized taxi servicesDrawing on groundbreaking research, amplified with on-the-ground examples from companies as diverse as Google, Infosys, Goldman Sachs, and Siemens, this book is required reading for all companies seeking to strengthen their talent pipeline in these rich and expanding markets.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Culture in Business"]},{"id":"9780749457051","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Customer Care Excellence, 6th Edition","authors":["Sarah Cook"],"pages":"288","publication_date":"November 2010","description":"Customer Care Excellence sets the scene for customer care against a backdrop of increasing customer expectations, globalization and developing technology.

Gloor"],"pages":"7","publication_date":"April 2014","description":"Managing employees who work together globally is an ongoing challenge for executives of large organizations. The ability to quickly detect changes in the health of relationships with clients can unlock significant value. Many companies monitor customer satisfaction through customer satisfaction surveys, such as the Net Promoter Score (NPS) pioneered by Bain & Co. However, such methods are limited in their ability to provide frequent, detailed and cost-effective evaluations. The way people interact with each other and what they say offer an important window into how they feel about each other. However, the content of what is said is often less significant than how it is said and the accompanying body language. Although face-to-face meetings between providers and customers may offer the clearest and most comprehensive way for managers to gauge customer satisfaction, such information is not generally available in high-volume, globalized collaborations. The authors have developed an assessment method for analyzing email communication patterns between customers and vendors in geographically distributed environments where face-to-face meetings are impractical or impossible. In conducting the research, the authors analyzed the email interactions of 32 service delivery organizations — all part of Genpact, a large global services provider. After notifying the various parties involved and obtaining permissions, the authors retrieved the communications between account managers and their customers and constructed the social network. The authors collected the email boxes of two to three account executives per customer studied and compared the network structure of the communications to the customer’s NPS, which was the primary customer satisfaction metric Genpact had been using. The authors also collected the email headers from incoming and outgoing emails for the account executives over a period of eight months. The researchers compared the structure of the resulting communication network with the NPS scores. The authors acknowledge that the method is specifically based on email analysis, and thus it is poorly suited to work contexts where email is not widely employed. In the future, they suggest that it might be possible to adapt the methodology to other electronic media, such as instant messaging services and voice-over-IP telephony.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Sales","Customer Service"]},{"id":"9781098174156","language":"en","level":null,"title":"Improve Your Critical Thinking Skills","authors":["Charles Humble"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"August 2024","description":"This selection of shortcuts will enable you to improve your communication, critical thinking, documentation, and networking skills.

Decision makers at all levels are required to manage the consequences of complexity every day. They must deal with problems that arise unexpectedly, generate uncertainty, are characterised by interconnectivity, and spread across traditional boundaries. Simple solutions to complex problems are usually inadequate and risk exacerbating the original issues.\n\nLeaders of international bodies such as the UN, OECD, UNESCO and WHO — and of major business, public sector, charitable, and professional organizations — have all declared that systems thinking is an essential leadership skill for managing the complexity of the economic, social and environmental issues that confront decision makers. Systems thinking must be implemented more generally, and on a wider scale, to address these issues.\n\nAn evaluation of different systems methodologies suggests that they concentrate on different aspects of complexity. To be in the best position to deal with complexity, decision makers must understand the strengths and weaknesses of the various approaches and learn how to employ them in combination. This is called critical systems thinking.

He looked into this new virtual money more than once and, each time, decided not to invest. Like many long-term investors, he was looking for fundamentals. Crypto had none — or so he thought. This book details why his perspective on cryptoassets has shifted – and why yours should, too.\n\nRecent developments in this field have turned crypto from a speculative financial innovation to a new asset class, one with a new kind of fundamentals that offer real economic value. One that will change finance and investments. One that may be a trigger defining the fourth industrial revolution, the same way steam, electricity, and the Internet were triggers for the first, second, and third industrial revolutions, respectively.\n\nDespite what advocates of the traditional financial establishmentlike to claim, cryptoassets were by far the best financial investment of the last decade, even risk-adjusted, and could still be so for the coming one. They should not be overlooked, regardless of one’s opinion of them.\n\nThis book answers the main questions any potential long-term investor in cryptoassets should ask:\n\nWhat are cryptoassets and blockchain technology?\nWhy consider cryptoasset investments?\nWhen is a good time to invest?\nWhere should one invest?\nHow should one invest?\nWhich valuation methods are appropriate?\n\nUnderstanding Crypto Fundamentals includes a deep dive into the management of risks specific to cryptoassets, both financial and non-financial, and provides the tools needed for investment success in this new asset class. Upon completing the book, you will have a new perspective on cryptoassets and how you can benefit from them as an investor.\nThomas Jeegers is a CFA Charterholder and Financial Risk Manager (FRM), and has earned an MBA from INSEAD as well as multiple blockchain certifications from institutions including INSEAD and Oxford University. He has worked in finance for 10 years and is a frequent speaker at events on blockchain and cryptoassets.","tags":["Software Development","Blockchain / Decentralized Apps","Blockchain","Cryptocurrency"]},{"id":"9780133429961","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"The Dart Programming Language","authors":["Gilad Bracha"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"December 2015","description":"Dart is a class-based, object-oriented language that simplifies the development of structured modern apps, scales from small scripts to large applications, and can be compiled to JavaScript for use in any modern browser.

We'll show you how. It's time to adopt a brand new mindset. Remote working is here to stay. Come and join us.\n\nRemote working is on the rise. Whether or not we are remote workers, it is likely we are all part of a global workforce. We need to learn to interact remotely, because we are all remote from someone in some way.

Then, we'll learn the mindset of treating everyone as remote, and conquer both synchronous and asynchronous communication. You'll learn how to produce amazing artifacts, how to communicate clearly, and how to manage yourself and your teams. Then we'll look at the bigger picture: from measuring the remote readiness of your workplace, to creating a handbook for your team, to exploring remote-first culture and tackling burnout and mental well-being.\n\nFundamentally we'll see that adopting a remote-working mindset can do wonders for our organization, our effectiveness, and our impact in our careers.

Sometimes their expectations of you seem unreasonable. But sometimes your expectations of them seem just as unreasonable (in their eyes). The problem is that these mismatched expectations can lead to misunderstandings, frayed nerves, and ruffled feathers. More seriously, they often lead to flawed systems, failed projects, and a drain on resources. Managing Expectations shows how to identify expectations and suggests ways to gain more control of them. In today's turbulent business world, understanding and meeting your customers' expectations is indeed a challenge, and it's not hard to understand why: Expectations affect a range of interactions, including service responsiveness, service capability, product functionality, and project success. Expectations are difficult to control and impossible to turn off.

Capitalism as we know it today—an amoral culture of short-term self-interest, profit maximization, emphasis on shareholder value, isolationist thinking, and profligate disregard of long-term consequences—is an unsustainable system, a monster set to consume itself.Danah Zohar and Ian Marshall argue that a critical mass of individuals acting from higher motivations can make a difference. They offer a radically new philosophy for corporate governance that alters the meaning and purpose of business and wealth creation. They describe a values-based business culture that focuses on the accumulation of “spiritual capital” rather than material capital. Rather than strictly benefiting shareholders, spiritual capital benefits all stakeholders—including the whole human race, present and future, and the planet itself. Spiritual capital nourishes and sustains the human spirit. Danah Zohar and Ian Marshall introduce the concept of spiritual intelligence (SQ), and describe how it can be used to shift individuals and our culture from a state of acting from lower motivations (fear, greed, anger, and self-assertion) to one of acting from higher motivations (exploration, cooperation, power-within, mastery, and higher service). They show how this shift actually happens in a given organizational culture. They look in depth at the issues that dominate corporate culture and examine the role of the leadership elite who must be the ones to bring about and embody this cultural shift. Finally, Zohar and Marshall argue that spiritual capital is a valid and workable form of capitalism and detail what we, as individuals, can do to make it happen.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Culture in Business"]},{"id":"9781801074391","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Creating Actionable Insights Using CRM Analytics","authors":["Mark Tossell"],"pages":"368","publication_date":"December 2021","description":"Creating Actionable Insights Using CRM Analytics is your comprehensive guide to mastering CRM Analytics, a data analytics platform integrated with Salesforce.

In this book Yiassemides suggests that temporality plays an important role in many of Jung's central ideas, and is closely interlinked with his overall approach to the psyche and the cosmos at large.\n\nJung proposed a profound truth: that time is relative at large. To appreciate the whole of our experience we must reach beyond causality and temporal linearity, to develop an approach that allows for multidimensional and synchronistic experiences. Jung’s understanding surpassed Freud's dichotomous approach which restricted timelessness to the unconscious; his time theory allows us to reach beyond the everyday time-bound world into a greater realm, rich with meaning and connection.\n\nIncluded in the book:\n\n-Jung’s time theory\n\n-the death of time\n\n-time and spatial metaphors\n\n-the role of time in precognition, telepathy and synchronicity -Unus mundus and time\n\n-a comparison of Freud’s and Jung’s time theories: temporal directionality, dimensionality, and the role of timelessness.\n\nThis book is the first to explore time and timelessness in a systematic manner from a Jungian perspective, and the first to investigate how the concept of time affected the overall development of Jung's theory.

Coverage includes a historical perspective on the business models of the three major waves of private equity leading to today's 4.0 model, a detailed analysis of the industry today, as well as reflections on the future of private equity and prospective futures. It also provides readers with the analytical and financial tools to analyze a fund's performance, with clear explanations of the mechanisms, organizations, and individuals that make the system work.\n\nThe authors demystify private equity by providing a balanced, but critical, review of its contributions and shortcomings and moving beyond the simplistic journalistic descriptions. Its ecosystem is complex and not recognizing that complexity leads to inappropriate judgments. Because of its assumed opacity and some historical deviant (and generally transient) practices, it has often been accused of evil intents, making it an ideal scapegoat in times of economic crisis, prodding leading politicians and regulators to intervene and demand changes in practices. Unfortunately, such actors were often responding to public calls for action rather than a thorough understanding of the factors at play in this complex interdependent system, doing often more harm than good in the process and depriving economies of one of their most dynamic and creative forces. Self-regulation has clearly shown its limits, but righteous political interventions even more so.\n\nPrivate equity investment can be a valuable addition to many portfolios, but investors need a clear understanding of the forces at work before committing to this asset class. With detailed explanations and expert insights, Private Equity 4.0 is a comprehensive guide to the industry ways and means that enables the reader to capture its richness and sustainability.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Corporate Valuation"]},{"id":"9780857089540","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"The Storytelling Hero","authors":["Stewart Bewley"],"pages":"192","publication_date":"June 2023","description":"\"Full of practical steps that everyone can use to become a compelling storyteller.\"—Steve Pierce, Deputy Managing Director and Chief HR Oficer, Hitachi, Europe\n\n\"Raw and actionable, but with a dreamer's heart, 'The Storytelling Hero' helps even the most reluctant presenter find their voice, while Stew Bewley weaves through his own story to help us think carefully about message and motivation, humanity and heroes.\"—Aimee Riordan, Senior Communications Manager and reader, writer, storyteller at Microsoft\n\nMake your next speech one to remember\n\nWith expert guidance from veteran public speaking coach Stewart Bewley, you'll discover how to gain the confidence needed to become a phenomenal public speaker.

Version 1.1, updated January 17, 2022\n\nIn Take Control of Cryptocurrency, Glenn Fleishman casts aside the headlines and hype around cryptocurrency to dig in on the fundamentals. You learn everything you need to know as an individual from the ground up about cryptocurrency, including details about the popular forms of it. You’ll find out what risks it poses for the planet—and for your pocketbook. Discover the role of a cryptocurrency wallet, how to find the best one, and how to use it safely. You will understand the ins and outs of buying and selling cryptocurrency and using it for real-world purchases and sales. Glenn also explains the mystery of NFTs (non-fungible tokens), which are a peculiar but popular use of cryptocurrency that lets you own unique digital artwork.\n\nCryptocurrency is a new way of representing value that’s going through the throes of change and no one knows exactly what form of it will survive and thrive. It hit the mainstream years ago but 2021 seemed to whip people into a frenzy over Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, and several other popular forms. Valuations—the price in cash one could get when selling cryptocurrency—soared. But cryptocurrency doesn’t have an inherent price: it’s worth only what people will pay for it. In May 2021, most cryptocurrencies plunged in value by half or more.\n\nMeanwhile, a similar furor arose over the introduction of “non-fungible tokens” (NFTs), a way to use an aspect of cryptocurrency to buy and sell unique ownership of digital assets, like born-digital art and clips from NBA basketball games. NFTs similarly suffered a giant drop in value from a peak in May 2021. What is this all about, anyway? Why did cryptocurrency and NFTs tank?\n\nTake Control of Cryptocurrency ignores the hype in favor of the reality beneath it. This new form of currency is not going away, even if the price in dollars, euros, and renminbi may fluctuate madly. The future of the economy will incorporate cryptocurrency and you can get to know it in great but understandable detail with the help of author Glenn Fleishman.\n\nThis book teaches you what cryptocurrency really is and how it relates to government-backed money. Glenn walks through all the parts of a cryptocurrency in clear detail—like a wallet, blockchain, and transactions—and explains how cryptocurrencies produce permanent transfers. He also lets you see two different kinds of risk: the side effects of Bitcoin and others in consuming massive amounts of electricity and the rise of ransomware on the back of somewhat anonymized payments, and the risk to your pocketbook from scams and thefts (and how to guard against them).\n\nOf course, you also learn how to manage cryptocurrency: find out what a wallet does and how to obtain one (and which might be a good fit); buying, selling, and exchanging cryptocurrency; and even purchasing or selling items in the physical world using cryptocurrency. Glenn also delves into how NFTs swept the news in early 2021, as creators and others staked a claim on defining an “original” item in a digital world, and how—and whether—to get involved in buying and selling NFTs.\n\nWarning: Purchasing, holding, and selling cryptocurrency comes with a large variety of risks. This book doesn’t recommend investing in it or offer legal or financial advice. Instead, it’s an objective, friendly introduction to understanding and engaging in it, teaching a reader the risks so they can manage them.\n\nThis covers everything to do with cryptocurrency that you need to know to become an informed participant:\n\nMaster the elements that let you get set up and successfully buy, sell, and hold cryptocurrency.\nLearn what the blockchain is and how it works to commit transactions irrevocably.\nGet to know all the parts of a cryptocurrency, like coins, transactions, and wallets.\nDig into mining to understand the role that specialized participants in a cryptocurrency play in keeping the system running.\nDiscover the details and basics of major cryptocurrencies, including how to understand transaction fees and pay just the right amount when you post a transaction.\nAvoid fraud by learning how hackers and malware might target you.\nFigure out the right cryptocurrency wallet for you and how to protect its secrets.\nDevelop a working knowledge of proof of work and proof of stake, popular methods by which cryptocurrency ensure transactions are accurate and permanently committed.\nLearn why Bitcoin is using a significant percentage of the world’s electricity, and how that might change.\nThe emergence of cryptocurrency is a challenge to governments, particularly tax agencies. Get a grasp on what you need to know to record your interactions and avoid running afoul of financial rules and penalties.\nPuzzle out what a non-fungible token (NFT) really is and whether it means anything—to you or anyone else.","tags":["Software Development","Blockchain / Decentralized Apps","Blockchain","Cryptocurrency"]},{"id":"9781782173977","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Learning Apex Programming","authors":["Matthew Kaufman","Michael Wicherski"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"January 2015","description":"'Learning Apex Programming' is an essential guide for developers seeking to master the Apex programming language and leverage it to enhance Salesforce1 applications.

A financial revolution is materializing before our eyes. The way individuals, organizations, and governments conduct transactions—from purchasing a book online to acquiring major corporations to delivering billions in financial aid—will look vastly different in the near future. Bitcoin is spearheading this revolution and may be the best investment opportunity of our time, yet most people have yet to understand its promise. In this book, Bobby C. Lee, one of the earliest, most successful pioneers in the cryptocurrency space, debunks myths and dispels fears that surround Bitcoin, arguing that this rational, logical system is superior to traditional monetary systems. He cites signs of Bitcoin’s widening acceptance: a growing community of users worldwide and multiple initiatives for investing in and holding bitcoin among major financial services organizations and institutional investors who control trillions in assets. Lee offers a primer on the best strategies for investing in this digital currency, the value of which will only continue to grow. He discusses the pros and cons, and covers the complicated yet more profitable method of acquiring bitcoin, mining. He offers predictions for the future, including price, trajectory, use, and participation in the larger economy—as well as developments in regulation, technology, business, and society.

With Tailwind, you can style your text, move your items on the page, design complex page layouts, and adapt your design for devices from a phone to a wide-screen monitor. With this book, you'll learn how to use the Tailwind for its flexibility and its consistency, from the smallest detail of your typography to the entire design of your site.\n\nWith CSS, you can do amazing things to the basic text and images on your website, and with just a little bit of client-side code to add and remove CSS classes, you can do exponentially more. CSS can also be hard to debug, complicated to write, and hard to maintain - Ã??Ã?Âbut it doesn't have to be. With Tailwind, you can minimize the amount of CSS you need to write, making it easier to control and debug, and yet still enjoy full flexibility and consistency across your site. Use Tailwind to build complex page layouts, add responsive design that adjusts to different screen widths, and dramatically reduce the amount of CSS you need.\n\nThe Tailwind setup is extremely explicit, and makes it possible to understand the display just by looking at the HTML markup. Start by designing the typographic details of the individual elements, then placing and manipulating those elements in \"the box\" - the rectangle of space each element takes up on screen - using a flexbox or grid design. Move those elements around the page with helpful small animations and transitions. With Tailwind, it's easy to prototype, iterate, and customize your display. Use prefixes to specify behavior. Change defaults, add new behavior, or integrate with legacy CSS.\n\nUse Tailwind to make extraordinary web designs without extraordinary effort.\n\nWhat You Need:\n\nThis book is about Tailwind 2.0.

This innovative approach is particularly suited to the valuation of companies in industries where an underlying asset has high volatility (such as the mining or oil industries) or where research and development costs are high (for example, the pharmaceutical industry).

The author engages readers with an insightful and brief claim:  \"Values are more than numbers.\"  He then provides support for just how important human capital is to the value creation paradox.  He doesn't stop there because ideas without definitive actions don't promote transformation.  He further challenges the reader with:  \"If you don't think outside of the box, you're doomed to live in the box.\"A user-friendly manual chock full of vignettes, suggestions and pithy commentary EVE is a must read for owners, officers, boards and advisors to derive understanding of business value drivers.  This book teaches the reader how to conduct more intangible asset due diligence as well as what decisions and behaviors impact value. With more effective methods of risk identification, measurement, management, and mitigation (\"IMMM\"), trusted advisors and owners can establish a \"working on the business\" strategy to prioritize issues impacting a company's intangible assets – assets which almost inevitably create the largest component of value in flourishing companies. This focus also serves to reduce risk while leveraging human capital and operational effectiveness. This book challenges users of value enhancement and valuation services to demand greater intellectual rigor to best serve owners/investors of the United States' economic engine—the midmarket company. Therefore, readers are challenged to look beyond the common metrics and numbers.  They are admonished to rely less on formulaic approaches and on software that can generate spurious opinions. The reader is called to action by the author, a US Marine Combat Officer veteran, to lead the change: \"You burn the boats if you want to be sure you succeed taking the island.\"Trillions of dollars of private equity are changing hands as Baby Boomer owners and investors seek greater liquidity and legacies while investors seek higher returns from direct investment in private companies.

The familiar financial metrics may not be providing adequate indications of value creation – the core principle of most shareholder investment expectation. To identify risk and work with it effectively, practitioners need an in-depth understanding of the forces at play. Equity Value Enhancement is a detailed, insightful guide for making better equity decisions. Finally, the author puts his passion front and center by offering the reader the opportunity to invest in the human capital this book addresses by encouraging support of military veteran's with combat PTSD so they may be productive citizens with the leadership and business skills provided by our country's \"Greatest Generation.\"","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Corporate Valuation"]},{"id":"0596527330","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"CSS: The Definitive Guide, 3rd Edition","authors":["Eric A.

For many people the actuality of organizational life is that they do not feel they are treated as the most important assets and they do not feel their knowledge is understood or used.\n\n The arguments for the central role of people can play in the creation of sustainable competitive advantage are compelling. Each of us has our own set of stories about how people have made a real difference to their business. Living Strategy demonstrates that the companies who will be most successful in the 21st century will be those that are capable of gathering and bonding talented, creative people, who are excited and motivated, who trust the company and are inspired by what they do.

It will bring strategy to life for businesses because it will bring strategy to life for people.  \n\nLiving Strategy puts forth three basic tenets that differentiate people from money and technology: we operate in time, we search for meaning, and we have soul. These tenets are then used as the basis for putting human capital at the center of corporate strategy.\n\n We operate in time  Our current behavior is influenced by the memory of the past and by the beliefs of the future. Human development progresses through a shared sequence as skills and knowledge may take years to develop and attitudes and values area resistant to rapid change.\n\nWe search for meaning  We strive to interpret the clues and events around us, we actively engage with the world, to seek a sense of meaning - to understand who we are and what we can contribute. Over time groups of people create collective viewpoints, a sense of shared symbols, which may be events or artifacts are important in creating a sense of meaning.\n\n We have a soul  Each of us has a deep sense of personal identity of what we are and of what we believe in. We can trust and feel inspired by our work - and when we do we are more creative. We can dream about possibilities and events. We can choose to give or withhold our knowledge - depending on how we feel.  Living Strategy takes the reader through the why and the how of thinking and acting differently to increase the performance of their business, and create organizations, which have meaning and soul.\n\nContents\n\nThe need for a fundamental shift in our thinking\n\nThe first tenet: we operate in time\n\nThe second tenet: we search for meaning\n\nThe third tenet: we have soul\n\nBridging from theory to reality\n\nCreating a vision\n\nScanning for capability and identifying the gap\n\nCreating a map of the system\n\nBridging from dreams to reality\n\nBuilding human capital","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Culture in Business"]},{"id":"9781119405726","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Culture Hacker","authors":["Shane Green"],"pages":"224","publication_date":"April 2017","description":"HACK YOUR WORKPLACE CULTURE FOR GREATER PROFITS AND PRODUCTIVITY\n\n\"I LOVE THIS BOOK!\" —CHESTER ELTON, New York Times bestselling author of All In and What Motivates Me\n\n\"When companies focus on culture, the positive effects ripple outward, benefiting not just employees but customers and profits.

Now, in Contagious You, she hones in on the individual, showing us how each of us is contagious in our own way and stressing the importance of leading with intention to achieve positive results.\n\nFor anyone who’s sought to create change, or felt sucked into the drama and chaos of a toxic work environment, this book will advance the notion that everyone at an organization is a leader – for good or for bad – and that leaders have tremendous power to influence those who follow their example. The quality of our leadership is based upon our intentions, energy, and presence. By emphasizing authorship, self-care, and response-ability (not responsibility) as leadership skills and therefore cultural amplifiers, Contagious You shows you how to walk the path of more effective leadership while navigating the road blocks in your way. Whether these road blocks are working with negative co-workers with secret agendas and unrealistic expectations, or just the general “busyness” of life and its excessive demands, this book will take you on a journey to create more space, more courageous leadership, and stronger collaboration to influence others and create the impact you desire.\n\nThe common denominator is YOU. No matter what level you’re on, your intentions, energy, and presence impact your ability to do anything within your life. Contagious You is an invitation to UNLOCK your own power. YOU set the tone. YOU are the culture.

Therefore, from this perspective, debt can be viewed as the sale of a financial put option. As a result, financial analysts are able to establish different valuations of a company, according to these two financing methods. Valuation of the Liability Structure by Real Options explains how the real options method works in conjunction with traditional methods. This innovative approach is particularly suited to the valuation of companies in industries where an underlying asset has high volatility (such as the mining or oil industries) or where research and development costs are high (for example, the pharmaceutical industry). Integration of the economic value of net debt (rather than the accounting value) and integration of the asset volatility are the main advantages of this approach.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Corporate Valuation"]},{"id":"9781484290453","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Building With Ethereum: Products, Protocols, and Platforms","authors":["Jamie Rumbelow"],"pages":"272","publication_date":"February 2023","description":"Build products on top of Ethereum's new and expansive technological stack.\n\nWriting any good web application requires planning, care, and deft technical skills, but Ethereum's execution model presents its own challenges for engineers wishing to build applications on top of its smart contract layer.

The nation is suffering from a widespread lack of truly customer-satisfying service. We lack the very thing that we need to make this new paradigm work efficiently: service-ability.\n\nOrganizations of all kinds are facing high customer churn, serious customer antagonism, loss of consumer confidence and plummeting customer satisfaction. Research shows that totally satisfying the customer is the only thing that will secure loyalty and offer significant competitive advantage. Yet still, on a daily basis we encounter service that frustrates us.\n\nWhilst the emergence of technology has no doubt brought efficiency to many areas of business activity, including the third sector, it has led to the standardised and indifferent service we regularly receive. We appear to have lost sight that people do business with people. Through efficient technology, our organisations may be serviceable but they are not service able.\n\nThe arrival of Generation Y and the developments in social media, provide businesses with a whole new way to engage with their customers, but also provide a new way for customers to rate companies, products and services: not always in a positive manner. 'Like' or '#Fail' have become part of our social language.\n\nOrganizations that refocus on the need to treat customers in a way that satisfies them, and not the technology, will have better customer retention, lower costs of replacement and will build their brand value through better reputations.\n\nService-Ability delves deeply into these areas to show how today's managers need to re-think the way we structure, manage, lead and organize our companies to achieve total 'customer-centric' work cultures that develop lasting relationships with customers.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Sales","Customer Service"]},{"id":"9780470274361","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"HTML, XHTML, and CSS: Your visual blueprint™ for designing effective Web pages","authors":["Rob Huddleston"],"pages":"383","publication_date":"June 2008","description":"If you’ve ever been curious about any of the multitude of internet acronyms, the web technologies they represent, and how they can benefit you, this book is a great place to start.

In fact, one survey found that while 80 percent of companies described themselves as delivering “superior” service, consumers estimated the number at a mere 8 percent. The problem, according to service expert Steve Curtin, is actually quite simple. When asked what their work entails, most employees list the duties and tasks associated with their position. Very few refer to the true essence of their job, which should be their highest priority—to create delighted customers who will be less price sensitive, have higher repurchase rates, and enthusiastically recommend the company or brand to others. Without this customer focus, all that exists is a transaction—and transactional service does not make a lasting positive impression or inspire loyalty. In Delight Your Customers, Curtin reveals three elements common to all exceptional service experiences. He also makes a compelling case that attention needs to shift from monitoring service activities to modeling, recognizing, and reinforcing the behaviors that actually create happy customers, such as expressing genuine interest, offering sincere compliments, sharing unique knowledge, conveying authentic enthusiasm, providing pleasant surprises, and delivering service heroics when needed.

The challenge is customers often don't know precisely what they want. As Henry Ford is reputed to have said, “If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.\" To surprise and awe your customers, Chip Bell advises developing co-creation partnerships with them. Co-creation partnerships are about fulfilling customers' hopes and aspirations, not just their needs and expectations. Co-creation partnerships require (1) curiosity that uncovers insight, (2) grounding that promotes clear focus, (3) discovery that fosters risk-taking, (4) trust that safeguards partnership purity, and (5) passion that inspires energized generosity. Using examples from organizations like McDonald's, DHL, Marriott, Lockheed Martin, Discover Financial, Ultimate Software, and many more, Bell shows how co-creation partnerships enable you to tap into the treasure trove of ideas, ingenuity, and genius-in-the-raw within every customer.","tags":["Business","Project & Product Management","Product Management","Customer Experience"]},{"id":"9781576751732","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"A Peacock in the Land of Penguins: A Fable about Creativity & Courage","authors":["Warren H.

Although we now have ample insight into how customers evaluate new products, many companies focus primarily on creating value -- without enough regard to how customers recognize innovations and evaluate new products.\n\nThere are only two ways consumers can collect information, the author notes: They can search, or they can infer. Knowing when consumers will search or infer will help you determine which of your innovations customers will recognize.\n\nThe Internet has had a profound impact on the way customers evaluate many products. First, it has lowered the cost of search by making information more accessible. Second, the Internet has broadened what is searchable by including customer reviews as well as product features on standard spec sheets.\n\nTo ensure that customers will recognize the value your products offer, the author recommends focusing on three questions: Are customers motivated to search?

Next, he demonstrates CVA at work, presents research and case studies that prove its value, and shows how to use it to consistently measure, manage, and optimize profit, cash flow, and shareholder value. Readers will learn why CVA works; how to measure it; how changes in CVA correlate to changes in profits and cash flow; and how to use CVA to steer the enterprise. Along the way, Sexton illuminates CVA's key implications for managers, including why managers must focus attention simultaneously on both customers and costs, and why well-publicized \"generic strategies\" such as \"net recommend\" offer only part of the solution.

Congratulations to Glen Urban for moving 'best marketing practice' up a notch.\"\n\n—Philip Kotler, author of several books on marketing, including Kotler on Marketing, Marketing From A to Z, Lateral Marketing, Ten Deadly Marketing Sins, Social Marketing, and the best-selling and authoritative textbook, Marketing Management, now in its 12th edition.\n\nTraditional \"push/pull\" marketing no longer works. Even highly-touted customer relationship initiatives are failing. Smart companies are pioneering an entirely new route to higher margins and sustainable competitive advantage: customer advocacy. This book reveals how it works, why it works, and how to make it work for your company.\n\nIn today's environment, you must build unprecedented trust among customers who have more information, options, and sophistication than ever. You must transcend \"relationship marketing\" to focus on maximizing customer interests and deepening customer partnerships. It's not easy. But if you do it, you gain immense opportunities your competitors simply can't touch.\n\nGlen Urban offers a complete blueprint for getting there. You'll learn how to improve on all eight elements of customer advocacy, from transparency to partnership. Urban answers frequently asked questions about advocacy strategies, helping you identify and overcome your most significant obstacles. Then, drawing on new case studies, he shows how to align culture, metrics, incentives, and organization, driving effective advocacy throughout your entire organization.\n\nPower shift: Why your customers now drive your relationship ...and why they no longer respond to conventional marketing\n\nDo your customers trust you now?

You can fight them, and lose. Or you can become a true customer advocate, and win.\n\nCustomer advocacy means faithfully representing your customers' interests. It means giving them open, honest, and complete information (because they'll discover the truth no matter what you do). It means talking with them, not at them. And it requires a massive transformation in both your culture and your processes. Now, one of the world's leading marketing innovators shows why you must make that transformation— and how to make it work.\n\nMIT's Glen Urban covers the entire \"pyramid\" of customer advocacy: the \"base\" (starting with TQM and customer satisfaction initiatives); the \"middle\" (relationship marketing); and the \"pinnacle\": new advocacy techniques built on trust, not coercion. Drawing on the latest customer advocacy initiatives at firms such GM, Intel, Qwest, and John Deere, he identifies crucial lessons for earning customer trust, keeping it, and profiting from it.\n\n© Copyright Pearson Education.

Customers today have unlimited information at their fingertips—and can influence the purchase decisions and behaviors of millions of others. With this comes a shift in the balance of power, and every company must come to terms with the fact that the customer is in control. Interacting with customers in the way they want is an essential business strategy and in many industries, the key to business success.\n\nExecutives still refer to B2B and B2C business models, as though companies control demand by going to customers with products and services. But as Bill Price and David Jaffe (authors of The Best Service is No Service) show, a new business model is emerging in which the customer directs the relationship. It is becoming a world of \"Me2B\"—one in which the customer, not the business, dictates the terms of engagement. In order for your business to thrive, you must create positive experiences to fulfill a range of customer needs.\n\nThough the mediums for customer engagement continuously evolve, Price and Jaffe show that customer needs remain unchanging. In Your Customer Rules!, they define a critical hierarchy of seven needs that your company can meet and apply as a methodology.\n\nThroughout this practical guidebook, Price and Jaffe share examples of companies who succeed by meeting these seven needs, including Amazon, Apple, IKEA, Nordstrom, USAA, Shoes of Prey, Vente-Privee, and Yamato Transport, as well as those that didn't. Your Customer Rules! offers tailored advice for companies at every stage, from nimble startups to legacy firms with established customer service practices—and everyone in between.\n\nWith a simple, elegant solution for driving lasting value for customers, Your Customer Rules! is a clear guide for strengthening customer relationships and competing on more than price.

Building authentic and lasting human relations may be the most important calling for leaders in this century. According to management and global leadership specialist Maya Hu-Chan, the concept of “saving face” can help any leader preserve dignity and create more empathetic cross-cultural relationships. “Face” represents one's self-esteem, self-worth, identity, reputation, status, pride, and dignity. Saving face is often understood as saving someone from embarrassment, but it's also about developing an understanding of the background and motivations of others to discover the unique facets we all possess. Without that understanding, we risk causing others to lose face without even knowing it. Hu-Chan explains saving face through anecdotes and practical tools, such as her BUILD leadership model (Benevolence, Understanding, Interacting, Learning, and Delivery). This book illustrates how we can give face to create positive first impressions, avoid causing others to lose face, and, most importantly, build trust and lasting relationships inside and outside the workplace.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Culture in Business"]},{"id":"9781609940621","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Good Company","authors":["Laurie Bassi","Ed Frauenheim","Lawrence Costello"],"pages":"296","publication_date":"September 2011","description":"Companies shirk taxes while padding profits.Firms foul the planet but keep raking in revenue.Reckless greed on Wall Street goes largely unpunished.More evidence that bad guys finish first in business?No. A different story is unfolding.Laurie Bassi and her coauthors show that despite the dispiriting headlines, we are entering a more hopeful economic age. The authors call it the “Worthiness Era.” And in it, the good guys are poised to win. Good Company explains how this new era results from a convergence of forces, ranging from the explosion of online information sharing to the emergence of the ethical consumer and the arrival of civic-minded Millennials. Across the globe, people are choosing the companies in their lives in the same way they choose the guests they invite into their homes. They are demanding that companies be “good company.”Proof is in the numbers. The authors created the Good Company Index to take a systematic look at Fortune 100 companies' records as employers, sellers, and stewards of society and the planet. The results were clear: worthiness pays off. Companies in the same industry with higher scores on the index—that is, companies that have behaved better—outperformed their peers in the stock market. And this is not some academic exercise: the authors have used principles of the index at their own investment firm to deliver market-beating results.Using a host of real-world examples, Bassi and company explain each aspect of corporate worthiness and describe how you can assess other companies with which you do business as a consumer, investor, or employee.

But most companies would rather slash costs, cut headcount, replace well-paid employees with lower-paid employees or outsourced workers, and reduce customer service. No wonder so many fail and how others focused on doing the right thing can remain profitable and growth-oriented for decades. James Parker shows why \"doing the right thing\" isn't just naïve \"feel-goodism\": it's the most powerful rule for business success. Parker's stories won't just convince readers: they'll move them. He tells how, after 9/11, Southwest made three pivotal decisions: no layoffs, no pay cuts, and \"no-penalty, no-questions-asked refunds\" for any customer wanting them. The result: Southwest's revenue passenger miles for 4Q01 dropped by only 0.5%, and its market cap soon exceeded all its major competitors combined. These pivotal decisions grew naturally from its culture of mutual respect and trust: Parker reveals how that culture developed, offering deeply personal insights into the principles that can make any team, organization or company strong. Discover how great leaders are found at every level, \"hire for attitude and train for skills,\" achieve unparalleled teamwork, and actually make work fun.

Members of minority groups strive to make their organizations better for others like themselves without limiting their career paths. Socially or environmentally conscious workers seek to act on their values at firms more concerned with profits than global poverty or pollution.\n\nYet many firms leave little room for differences, and people who don't \"fit in\" conclude that their only option is to assimilate or leave. In Rocking the Boat, Debra E. Meyerson presents an inspiring alternative: building diverse, adaptive, family-friendly, and socially responsible workplaces not through revolution but through walking the tightrope between conformity and rebellion.\n\nMeyerson shows how these \"tempered radicals\" work toward transformational ends through incremental means—sticking to their values, asserting their agendas, and provoking change without jeopardizing their hard-won careers. Whether it's by resisting quietly, leveraging \"small wins,\" or mobilizing others in legitimate but powerful ways, tempered radicals turn threats to their identities into opportunities to make a positive difference in their companies—and in the world.\n\nTimely and provocative, Rocking the Boat puts self-realization and change within everyone's reach—whether your difference stems from race, gender, sexual orientation, values, beliefs, or social perspective.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Culture in Business"]},{"id":"9780137083152","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Crowdsourcing Markets: Birds of a Feather Buy Together","authors":["Jon Spector","Barry Libert"],"pages":"8","publication_date":"February 2010","description":"This Element is an excerpt from We Are Smarter Than Me: How to Unleash the Power of Crowds in Your Business (9780132244794) by Barry Libert and Jon Spector. Available in print and digital formats.\n\nContent and beyond: enabling your customers to create your products for you!\n\nOur focus here is on the role of communities in manufacturing companies’ products or content.
