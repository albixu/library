It points to three spheres of contexts with different narratives for the year 2030 and beyond, in which the coming Metaverse as the precursor of the future Multiverse can be embedded naturally. The book aims at providing the reader with new cross-disciplinary research material, ranging from communication and computer science to cognitive science, social sciences, and behavioral economics, for building a deeper Metaverse. It will be instrumental in helping the reader find and overcome some of the most common 6G and Next G blind spots.\n\nModern networks are more than communication and computer science. They may be better viewed as techno-social systems that exhibit complex adaptive system behavior and resemble biological superorganisms. 6G and especially Next G should go beyond continuing the linear incremental 6G=5G+1G mindset of past generations of mobile networks. To this end, the book:\n\nHelps readers inquire into new areas of knowledge or understanding that they didn’t have or didn't pay attention to find their 6G/Next G blind spots\nHighlights the unique potential benefits of the virtual world for society in that it provides a useful extension of the real-world economy by compensating for its well-known market failures, e.g., rising income inequality\nProvides a comprehensive description of the original Metaverse vision and highlights the different Metaverse components, applications, open research challenges, and early Metaverse deployment examples from both industry and academia\nDescribes how the Multiverse goes beyond the Metaverse origins and explores the importance of experience innovation since experiences play a central role in the Metaverse\nExplains Web3 and the emerging field of token engineering and tokenization, i.e., the process of creating tokenized digital twins via programmable tokens, which are viewed as the killer application of Web3 networks for creating technology-enabled social organisms and restoring tech-driven common goods\nReviews anticipated 6G paradigm shifts and elaborates on the difference between 6G and Next G research, including Next G Alliance's audacious goals and their symbiotic relationship between technology and a population's societal and economic needs\nDoubles down on the mutually beneficial symbiosis between digitalization and biologization for our possible evolution into future metahumans with infinite capabilities by making us smarter and creating a fundamentally new form of sociality in the Metaverse and Multiverse as well as the future stigmergy enhanced Society 5.0 by leveraging on time-tested self-organization mechanisms borrowed from nature\nPresents a variety of different concepts of the true nature of reality that bring us closer to the original Metaverse vision and explains how 6G, Next G, and the Metaverse may eventually pave the way to the peak-experience machine that democratizes access to the upper range of human experiences\nTouches on the possible transition from communication to services beyond communication, most notably the cross-cultural phenomenon of communitas in anthropology and its increasing degrees of perceived connectedness with others, the world, and oneself, given the importance of creating a deep sense of community in the Metaverse\n\nWritten for students, network researchers, professionals, engineers, and practitioners, 6G and Onward to Next G: The Road to the Multiverse explores the latest Internet developments, with a particular focus on 6G and Next G networks in the context of the emerging Metaverse and future Multiverse as the successors of today’s mobile Internet that has defined the last two decades.","tags":["Hardware","Wireless Technology","Telecommunications","5G"]},{"id":"9780470030707","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"GSM - Architecture, Protocols and Services, Third Edition","authors":["Jörg Eberspächer","Hans-Jörg Vögel","Christian Bettstetter"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"February 2009","description":"With around 3 billion subscribers, GSM is the world's most commonly used technology for wireless communication.

Chris Sells’ book is in great position to be the definitive work on the emerging technology.”\n\n     —Brian Graff, Sr. SW Engineer, PreEmptive Solutions, Inc.\n\n“Chris has written the best WinForms book around. Period.”\n\n     —Pierre Nallet, DevelopMentor Instructor\n\n“Chris does a nice job of presenting the core elements of WinForms complete with many concise samples and graphic depictions of UI features in action. Even more compelling, however, is how Chris anticipates how most developers will want to use these features, and presents techniques and paradigms of usage that will be invaluable for any serious WinForms developer. This book is destined to become dog-eared in the hands anyone building WinForms applications.”\n\n     —Fritz Onion, DevelopMentor instructor and author of Essential ASP.NET\n\n“I don’t want just a description of the WinForms widgets. I can get that online or from other books. What I want is a roadmap for pitfalls to avoid, and innovative solutions for common problems. That is where this book shines.”\n\n     —Johan Ericcson, SW Engineer, Agilent\n\n“This is the definitive book for every Windows Programmer.”\n\n     —Fumiaki Yoshimatsu, Sr. Engineer, Intoferia Corporation\n\n“After browsing through countless books that introduce me to Windows Forms basics, it is refreshing to find a book that dives right into some real hard-core programming. This is, without a doubt the best and most useful C#/WinForms book I have ever read. I would suggest this book to be essential reading for very serious .NET WinForms developer who wants to work smarter instead of harder.”\n\n     —Serge Shimanovsky, Software Developer, Rueters Group PLC\n\n“In this book, Chris Sells discusses how the Windows Forms classes and their supporting infrastructure can be used to write robust and rich smart client applications. If you’re an experienced Windows programmer who has previously used MFC or directly utilized the Win32 API to write such applications, you will find Chris’s direct delivery very appropriate for transferring your knowledge to the managed classes. If you’re a developer with less Windows development experience, you’ll find the treatment of core concepts in application UI programming indispensable.”\n\n     —From the foreword by Mike Blaszczack, Architect, SQL Server Data Warehousing, Microsoft\n\n\"I think this book does a great job of hitting a huge number of features—sometimes I forget how much there is to WinForms!\"—Chris Anderson, Software Architect, Microsoft Windows Forms team\n\nProgramming Windows Forms in C# is the ultimate guide to using the Microsoft .NET forms package. Readers learn how to build smart client applications that take full advantage of both the rich user interface features of the Microsoft Windows operating system and the deployment features of HTML-based applications. Author Chris Sells draws upon his WinForms research and programming experience to provide what the Windows Forms documentation could not: a clear picture of exactly how C# programmers will want to use WinForms.\n\nWell-written and easy to navigate, this book presents the building blocks of WinForms and the best practices for creating stand-alone client applications and front ends to databases and Web services. Readers gain an understanding of the rationale behind aspects of WinForms' design and will find out how to avoid or solve common problems. Figures illustrate WinForms' user interface features and code samples are used throughout the book to demonstrate best practices. All code has been tested with Visual Studio .NET 1.1 and is available at www.sellsbrothers.com, where readers will also find updates to the book.\n\nThis book focuses on the topics readers need to understand in order to build real-world applications. These topics include:\n\nForm layout\n\nMultiple top-level windows\n\nNon-rectangular windows\n\nAccessing data from the middle tier, filesystems, XML, databases, and Web services\n\nClasses outside the System.WinForms namespace, including System.Drawing and System.Security\n\nCustom drawing\n\nHosting and building controls\n\nDesign-time integration\n\nData binding\n\nMultithreaded user interfaces\n\nDeploying WinForms over the Web\n\nMoving from MFC\n\nDelegates and events\n\nSerialization basics\n\nProgramming Windows Forms in C# is the tutorial for experienced Windows programmers who are serious about mastering Windows Forms.","tags":["Software Development","Programming Languages",".NET","Windows Forms"]},{"id":"9781119454847","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Ham Radio For Dummies, 3rd Edition","authors":["H.

Many businesses are also using their internal local and wide-area network infrastructure to replace legacy enterprise telephone networks. This migration to a single network carrying voice and data is called convergence, and it's revolutionizing the world of telecommunications by slashing costs and empowering users. The technology of families driving this convergence is called VoIP, or Voice over IP.\n\nVoIP has advanced Internet-based telephony to a viable solution, piquing the interest of companies small and large. The primary reason for migrating to VoIP is cost, as it equalizes the costs of long distance calls, local calls, and e-mails to fractions of a penny per use. But the real enterprise turn-on is how VoIP empowersbusinesses to mold and customize telecom and datacom solutions using a single, cohesive networking platform. These business drivers are so compelling that legacy telephony is going the way of the dinosaur, yielding to Voice over IP as the dominant enterprise communications paradigm.\n\nDeveloped from real-world experience by a senior developer, O'Reilly's Switching to VoIP provides solutions for the most common VoIP migration challenges. So if you're a network professional who is migrating from a traditional telephony system to a modern, feature-rich network, this book is a must-have. You'lldiscover the strengths and weaknesses of circuit-switched and packet-switched networks, how VoIP systems impact network infrastructure, as well as solutions for common challenges involved with IP voice migrations. Among the challenges discussed and projects presented:\n\nbuilding a softPBX\nconfiguring IP phones\nensuring quality of service\nscalability\nstandards-compliance\ntopological considerations\ncoordinating a complete system ?switchover?\nmigrating applications like voicemail and directoryservices\nretro-interfacing to traditional telephony\nsupporting mobile users\nsecurity and survivability\ndealing with the challenges of NAT\n\nTo help you grasp the core principles at work, Switching to VoIP uses a combination of strategy and hands-on \"how-to\" that introduce VoIP routers and media gateways, various makes of IP telephone equipment, legacy analog phones, IPTables and Linux firewalls, and the Asterisk open source PBX software by Digium.You'll learn how to build an IP-based or legacy-compatible phone system and voicemail system complete with e-mail integration while becoming familiar with VoIP protocols and devices. Switching to VoIP remains vendor-neutral and advocates standards, not brands. Some of the standards explored include:\n\nSIP\nH.323, SCCP, and IAX\nVoice codecs\n802.3af\nType of Service, IP precedence, DiffServ, and RSVP\n802.1a/b/g WLAN\n\nIf VoIP has your attention, like so many others, then Switching to VoIP will help you build your own system, install it, and begin making calls.

Internationally sought-after diversity consultant Tiffany Jana empowers readers to work against institutional bias no matter what their position is in an organization.   Building upon the revelatory power of her book Overcoming Bias, which addressed managing individual and interpersonal bias, Erasing Institutional Bias scales up the framework to impact systemic change in organizations. Jana and coauthor Ashley Diaz Mejias bring together in-depth research on how biases become embedded into workplace cultures with practical and engaging tools that will mobilize readers toward action. They confront specific topics such as racism, sexism, hiring and advancement bias and retribution bias, meaning when organizations develop a culture of aggression, and offer solutions for identifying and controlling them. This book urges readers to ask questions such as, “Are we attempting to create systems in which all people can thrive? What kind of world and what kind of workplaces are we cultivating?” These questions, the authors say, must first be answered by ourselves, recognizing our own role in perpetuating harmful biases that come to define institutions. In a world divided, Erasing Institutional Bias is designed to raise awareness about imbalances and help us hold ourselves accountable for creating a world that works for everyone. Each of us can evaluate our own current role in perpetuating systemic bias and define our new role in breaking it down. Jana and Mejias inspire and equip us so that we can all affect organizational change, together.","tags":["Business","Human Resources","Workforce Diversity"]},{"id":"9781783987641","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Zabbix Performance Tuning","authors":["Luciano Alves"],"pages":"152","publication_date":"June 2015","description":"Zabbix Performance Tuning provides a comprehensive guide to optimizing and enhancing Zabbix system performance.

Cognitive radio technology integrates computational intelligence into software-defined radio for embedded intelligent agents that adapt to RF environments and user needs. Using this technology, users can more fully exploit the radio spectrum and services available from wireless connectivity. For example, an attempt to send a 10MB e-mail in a zone where carrier charges are high might cause a cognitive radio to alert its user and suggest waiting until getting to the office to use the LAN instead. Cognitive Radio Architecture examines an \"ideal cognitive radio\" that features autonomous machine learning, computer vision, and spoken or written language perception.\n\nThe author of this exciting new book is the inventor of the technology and a leader in the field. Following his step-by-step introduction, readers can start building aware/adaptive radios and then make steps towards cognitive radio. After an introduction to adaptive, aware, and cognitive radio, the author develops three major themes in three sections:\n\nFoundations\n\nRadio Competence\n\nUser Domain Competence\n\nThe book makes the design principles of cognitive radio more accessible to students of teleinformatics, as well as to wireless communications systems developers. It therefore embraces the practice of cognitive radio as well as the theory. In particular, the publication develops a cognitive architecture that integrates disparate disciplines, including autonomous machine learning, computer vision, and language perception technologies. An accompanying CD-ROM contains the Java source code and compiled class files for applications developed in the book. In addition, for the convenience of the reader, Web resources introducing key concepts such as speech applications programmer interfaces (APIs) are included.\n\nAlthough still five to ten years away from full deployment, telecommunications giants and research labs around the world are already dedicating R&D to this new technology.

Before DHCP came along, administrators had to manually configure each host on a network with an IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway. Maintaining the changes and the associated logs took a tremendous amount of time and was prone to error. DHCP uses a client/server model in which the system updates and maintains the network information dynamically. Windows 2000 provides enhanced DHCP client-server support. DHCP for Windows 2000 is custom-designed for system administrators who are responsible for configuring and maintaining networks with Windows 2000 servers. It explains the DHCP protocol and how to install and manage DHCP on both servers and clients--including client platforms other than Windows 2000. Readers get detailed and explicit instructions for using Windows 2000 DHCP to manage their network IP configurations much more efficiently and effectively.They get background information for using DHCP in general, plus complete information about the Windows 2000 use of DHCP.

XPath and XPointer are two closely related languages that play a key role in XML processing by allowing developers to find these needles and manipulate embedded information. XPath describes a route for finding specific items by defining a path through the hierarchy of an XML document, abstracting only the information that's relevant for identifying the data. XPointer extends XPath to identify more complex parts of documents. The two technologies are critical for developers seeking needles in haystacks in various types of processing.XPath and XPointer fills an essential need for XML developers by focusing directly on a critical topic that has been covered only briefly. Written by John Simpson, an author with considerable XML experience, the book offers practical knowledge of the two languages that underpin XML, XSLT and XLink. XPath and XPointer cuts through basic theory and provides real-world examples that you can use right away.Written for XML and XSLT developers and anyone else who needs to address information in XML documents, the book assumes a working knowledge of XML and XSLT. It begins with an introduction to XPath basics. You'll learn about location steps and paths, XPath functions and numeric operators. Once you've covered XPath in depth, you'll move on to XPointer--its background, syntax, and forms of addressing. By the time you've finished the book, you'll know how to construct a full XPointer (one that uses an XPath location path to address document content) and completely understand both the XPath and XPointer features it uses.XPath and XPointer contains material on the forthcoming XPath 2.0 spec and EXSLT extensions, as well as versions 1.0 of both XPath and XPointer.

The painful reality is that performance is acceptable day after day, until quite suddenly it all falls apart. When this happens, the administrator needs to be prepared to help the organization get through the crisis. Computer applications are growing ever more intelligent and easy to use. One of the by-products of making applications easier to use is that they usually also require more resources to run. And wherever productivity is a central factor in the decisions you make, performance considerations loom large and continue to play an important role in system management. Are you wondering, for example, if more expensive equipment would give better performance? The answer is often yes, but not always. This book will show you why it is important to understand the performance characteristics of the hardware and of the workload, and how they match up against each other. Windows 2000 Performance Guide takes you through problem solving techniques like measurement methodology, workload characterization, benchmarking, decomposition techniques, and analytic queuing models.

Such diversity and choice should surely beg the question, “are manufacturers using the right technology for the right product?? Developing Practical Wireless Applications will explore this question and, in doing so, will illustrate many of the wireless technologies currently available whilst drawing upon their individual strengths and weaknesses. More specifically, the book will draw your attention to the diverse collection of standardized and proprietary solutions available to manufacturers. As developers and innovators your choices are not restricted to any norm and, as such, a standardized or proprietary solution may afford you greater benefits in realising any product roadmap. Developing Practical Wireless Applications will provide you with a comprehensive understanding of how each technology works, coupled with an exploration into overlapping, complementary and competing technologies. In establishing this foundation, we will explore wireless applications in their context and address their suitability.

In addition, the flexibility offered by the spread spectrum (SS) and time division multiplexing (TDM) techniques motivated many researchers to investigate several MC combined multiple access schemes, such as MC-CDMA, OFDMA and MC-TDMA. These schemes benefit from the advantages of each sub-system and offer high flexibility, high spectral efficiency, simple detection strategies and narrow-band interference rejection capability.\n\nMulti-Carrier and Spread Spectrum Systems is one of the first books to describe and analyze the basic concepts of multi-carrier OFDM transmission and its combination with spread spectrum (MC-CDMA). The different architectures and detection strategies as well as baseband-related transceiver components are explained. This includes topics like FEC channel coding and decoding, modulation and demodulation (IFFT/FFT), digital I/Q-generation, time and frequency synchronisation, channel estimation, frequency domain equalization and RF aspects such as phase noise and non-linearity issues. Concrete examples of its applications for cellular mobile communication systems (B3G/4G) are given. Further derivatives of MC-SS (such as OFDMA, SS-MC-MA and DFT-spread OFDM) and their corresponding applications in the LTE, WiMAX, WLAN and DVB-RCT standards are detailed. Capacity and flexibility enhancements of multi-carrier OFDM systems by different MIMO diversity techniques such as space time/frequency coding (STC, SFC) and software defined radio concepts are also described.\n\nWritten in a highly accessible manner this book provides a unique reference on the topics of multi-carrier and spread spectrum communications, assisting 4G engineers with their implementation.\n\nFully updated new edition of successful text, including two new chapters on LTE and WiMAX\n\nDescribes in detail new applications of OFDM in mobile communication standards\n\nExamines all multi-carrier spread spectrum schemes, with in-depth analysis, from theory to practice\n\nIntroduces the essentials of important wireless standards based on multi-carrier/spread spectrum techniques.","tags":["IT Operations","Computer Networking","Wireless Networks","LTE"]},{"id":"0738435309","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"ABCs of z/OS System Programming: Volume 9","authors":["Paul Rogers","Richard Conway"],"pages":"854","publication_date":"April 2011","description":"The ABCs of z/OS System Programming is an 13-volume collection that provides an introduction to the z/OS operating system and the hardware architecture.

Raman"],"pages":"272","publication_date":"September 2003","description":"Praise for XForms: XML Powered Web Forms\n\n“XForms is an exciting new technology for designing Web forms in an elegant and accessible way. Raman’s book provides strong motivations for flexibility in the design of human-machine interactions, and explains how to use XForms to this end in crystal-clear prose.”\n\n         —Eve Maler              XML Standards Architect, Sun Microsystems\n\n“Interactive forms technology is the logical evolution of Web user interface design. XForms represents a significant leap forward in that evolution.”\n\n         —Sean McGrath              CTO, Propylon\n\n“The greatest strength of this book is the skill with which T. V. Raman links the XForms technology with the larger context of the Web. The limitations of HTML forms, the ways in which XForms provides a better foundation for Web and Web service user interfaces, and the opportunities for an XForms-powered Web that is accessible to all users and devices are outlined and brought together in a compelling way.”\n\n         —Michael Champion              Advisory Research and Development Specialist, Software AG\n\n“Raman’s book gives the reader an excellent explanation of the emerging W3C XForms recommendation. It’s a well-organized and well-written book that begins with a gentle introduction to the concepts that motivated the development of XForms and then provides a reasonable overview of the relevant XML technology related to XForms. Most of the book covers XForms components: user interface controls, model properties, functions, actions, and events. It concludes with XForms as a Web service, offering multi-modal access and accessibility. In light of the October 2003 deadline for U.S. federal agencies to comply with the mandate of the Government Paperwork Elimination Act (GPEA) to give citizens the opportunity to provide information online, this important technical work comes none too soon. As T. V. masterfully elucidates, XForms provides the ‘last mile’ in ‘connecting users to their data.’ Insightfully, he also observes ‘the document is the human interface’ to data—an understanding without which the challenge to make eGov services ‘citizen-centered’ simply cannot and will not be met.”\n\n         —Owen Ambur              Cofounder and Cochair, XML Working Group, U.S. CIO Council\n\n“I found the author’s straightforward style quite comfortable and informative. I heartily recommend this book, especially for government XML developers interested in the broader area of E-Forms. Understanding XForms is key to developing robust and flexible E-Forms solutions that separate content, logic, validation, and presentation. You’ll never look at (X)HTML forms the same way after reading Raman’s book.”\n\n         —Kenneth Sall              GSA eGov Technical Architect/XML Specialist, SiloSmashers\n\n“Reusable components such as E-Forms are at the heart of the U.S. Federal Enterprise Architecture and E-Government, and XML standards-based solutions are starting to appear for use across the government. T. V. Raman’s book meticulously explains how XForms leverage the power of using XML for E-Forms and have been designed to abstract much of XML’s functionality into a set of components referred to as MVC (Model, View, Controller), which separates the model from its final presentation. This XForms component architecture serves as an excellent roadmap for the reader. T. V. eloquently shows how XForms make the original promise of ‘the document is the interface’ a reality so the collected data can be directly submitted to a Web service—thus putting a human face on Web services!”\n\n—Brand Niemann, Ph.D., Chair, XML Web Services Working Group, U.S. CIO Council\n\nXForms—XML-powered Web forms—are set to replace HTML forms as the backbone of electronic commerce. XForms enable the creation and editing of structured XML content within a familiar Web browser environment, which is likely to play a key role in enabling simple browser-based access to Web services. XForms leverage the power of XML in modeling, collecting, and serializing user input. In this book, World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) XForms specification editor T. V. Raman explains how programmers can create durable and dependable feature-rich forms accessible from multiple platforms and devices and available in multiple languages and modes.\n\nXForms play a key role in connecting humans to information technologies, deployed as Web services. This book begins by providing an overview of the XForms technology and the set of XML standards on which it is built, including XML Path Language (XPath), Dom2 events, XML events, XML namespaces, and XML Schema. Part II profiles the XForms architecture and its components. An introduction to the available user interface controls leads into a guide to creating complex user interfaces. The following chapters describe XForms model properties, functions, actions, and events. Each chapter’s increasingly complex examples illustrate the concepts discussed. The final part of the book details how XForms will be used to create a new generation of human-centric, multimodal, accessible Web transactions.\n\nReaders will learn:\n\nWhy XForms can deliver better user interaction at less cost\n\nHow the XForms technology works\n\nWhat comprises the XForms architecture\n\nHow to use XForms to connect users to Web services\n\nHow XForms can accommodate spoken and visual interaction\n\nHow to ensure universal accessibility to Web content with XForms\n\nXForms will transform the way companies and consumers handle Web transactions. XForms: XML Powered Web Forms provides Web developers, IT professionals, and Web server administrators with a firm grasp of this standard, how it will shape emerging solutions, and how it will change the nature of their day-to-day work.","tags":["Data","Data Engineering","Storage Formats","XML"]},{"id":"0596000537","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"XSLT","authors":["Doug Tidwell"],"pages":"480","publication_date":"August 2001","description":"XSLT documents a core technology for processing XML. Originally created for page layout, XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Transformations) is now much more: a general-purpose translation tool, a system for reorganizing document content, and a way to generate multiple results-- such as HTML, WAP, and SVG--from the same content. What sets XSLT apart from other books on this critical tool is the depth of detail and breadth of knowledge that Doug Tidwell, a developer with years of XSLT experience, brings to his concise treatment of the many talents of XSLT. He covers XSLT and XPath, a critical companion standard, and addresses topics ranging from basic transformations to complex sorting and linking. He explores extension functions on a variety of different XSLT processors and shows ways to combine multiple documents using XSLT. Code examples add a real-world dimension to each technique. Useful as XSLT is, its peculiar characteristics make it difficult to get started in, and the ability to use advanced techniques depends on a clear and exact understanding of how XSLT templates work and interact. For instance, the understanding of \"variables\" in XSLT is deeply different from the understanding of \"variables\" in procedural languages. The author explains XSLT by building from the basics to its more complex and powerful possibilities, so that whether you're just starting out in XSLT or looking for advanced techniques, you'll find the level of information you need.","tags":["Data","Data Engineering","Storage Formats","XML"]},{"id":"9780735624313","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Windows Administration Resource Kit: Productivity Solutions for IT Professionals","authors":["Dan Holme"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"February 2008","description":"Get the comprehensive, essential resource for improving Windows administrator productivity.

Surprisingly though, a large number of users--even highly experienced users--exhibit poor file management skills, resulting in frustration and lost data. This brief but invaluable book, File Management Made Simple can resolve this by providing you with the skills and best practices needed for creating, managing and protecting your data.\n\nDo any of the following scenarios sound familiar to you? You've downloaded an attachment from your e-mail, but aren't sure where you downloaded it to. You spent an entire evening working on a document only to discover the next morning that you didn't save it to your flash drive like you thought you had? Maybe you had a guest visiting and wanted to share with them the pictures you took of your kids recital, yet when you went to get them you were unable to recall where you stored them on your PC. Or you scanned your receipts for your expense reports on day and came back the next day and scanned some for another report only to find that the new ones numbered Scan 1, Scan 2,... still exist. Unfortunately, for a vast number of PC users, scenarios like these are all too common. These situations are not only extremely frustrating for the user, but also tend to discourage them from ever wanting to touch a PC again!\n\nWhy is that? What is the common factor? It's simple really. Each of these issues can be attributed to poor file management skills. In my experience, the people with the worst file management skills are simply the ones that lack an understanding of how to navigate the Windows operating system. However this situation can be easily rectified. And once you can successfully navigate your computer's drive and folder structure, you'll be hard pressed to misplace anything.\n\nAlthough this process can seem daunting to the uninitiated, this isn't black magic. In fact, it's actually quite simple. Keeping your files and folders organized on the computer is no more difficult than keeping them organized in real life. There is a place for everything and everything has its place. We will show you how to navigate Windows correctly and efficiently. Where specific types of files should be stored. We'll also show you how best to name and manage your files; such as using descriptive folders to identify files, implementing the best naming conventions for files and directories, and how to group various types of data together; ensuring that the data you need is always readily available. Finally we'll introduce you to some of the best options for transporting and protecting your data. We will show you the skills you need to easily manage your data, using clear and simple English, without the confusing technical jargon.

In recent decades, cognitive radio-based networks have garnered increased attention and have been well studied to overcome the problem of spectrum scarcity in future wireless communications systems. Many new challenges in resource allocation appear in cognitive radio-based networks. This book focuses on effective resource allocation solutions in several important cognitive radio-based networks, including opportunistic spectrum access networks, cooperative sensing networks, cellular networks, high-speed vehicle networks, and smart grids.\n\nCognitive radio networks are composed of cognitive, spectrum-agile devices capable of changing their configuration on the fly based on the spectral environment. This capability makes it possible to design flexible and dynamic spectrum access strategies with the purpose of opportunistically reusing portions of the spectrum temporarily vacated by licensed primary users. Different cognitive radio-based networks focus on different network resources, such as transmission slots, sensing nodes, transmission power, white space, and sensing channels.\n\nThis book introduces several innovative resource allocation schemes for different cognitive radio-based networks according to their network characteristics:\n\nOpportunistic spectrum access networks\n– Introduces a probabilistic slot allocation scheme to effectively allocate the transmission slots to secondary users to maximize throughput\nCooperative sensing networks\n– Introduces a new adaptive collaboration sensing scheme in which the resources of secondary users are effectively utilized to sense the channels for efficient acquisition of spectrum opportunities\nCellular networks\n– Introduces a framework of cognitive radio-assisted cooperation for downlink transmissions to allocate transmission modes, relay stations, and transmission power/sub-channels to secondary users to maximize throughput\nHigh-speed vehicle networks\n– Introduces schemes to maximize the utilized TV white space through effective allocation of white space resources to secondary users\nSmart grids\n– Introduces effective sensing channel allocation strategies for acquiring enough available spectrum channels for communications between utility and electricity consumers","tags":["Hardware","Wireless Technology","Telecommunications","Radio","Cognitive Radio"]},{"id":"9780132442701","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Ad Hoc Mobile Wireless Networks: Protocols and Systems","authors":["C.-K.

Johansson, author of Windows Server 2008 Security Resource KitThe credentials of the contributors to Windows Server 2008 Security Resource Kit are quite impressive. How important was it to assemble such a group for this title?In my opinion, it was necessary. Server products are necessarily complex, and security, by its very nature, requires a very broad understanding of the product. Developing that understanding in a single person is possible, but very time consuming and still does not lead to the breadth of perspective that you find in a group of people. No single person can truly understand both what it is like to implement Active Directory in a 50,000 seat organization, and how to run a 50-seat small business network long-term, and neither of them is probably going to also be one of the world's foremost experts on implementing public key cryptography infrastructures. By putting together this world-wide team of experts (representing four countries on three continents) we were able to produce a resource that had far more depth and breadth of knowledge than would otherwise have been possible, and you get the expertise of 12 of the foremost experts on Windows Security in a single package.What extras are available on the Resource Kit CD?First, you get a bonus chapter on Rights Management Services, as well as an electronic copy of the entire book. I am very excited about the electronic copy because it provides a searchable way to read the book. These types of books are always used as references and being able to search it is very valuable.You also get some tools that may come in handy for managing servers. Scripting Guru Ed Wilson wrote some custom PowerShell scripts specifically for this book to manage user accounts and other security related aspects of your deployment. In addition, I wrote a couple of tools for the book. One is my password generator, which I first made available several years ago. It enables you to manage unique administrator account passwords and service account passwords on hundreds or thousands of servers on a network. I also included my elevation tools, which allow you to launch an elevated instance of Windows Explorer, as well as elevating any command you want from the command line. Having worked with User Account Control (UAC) daily for about two years I find that one of the biggest impediments to running under UAC is the multiple prompts you get when you perform many file operations. As an administrator, that is a very common task. Elevating Windows Explorer lets you do those operations with a single elevation prompt, and still leave UAC turned on.Comparing the two programs, what are some of the fundamental differences between Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2003?To me, the biggest difference is the fact that while Windows Server 2003 was built under the security best practices of 2002, Windows Server 2008 incorporates all the secure development practices Microsoft learned in the five years since. The field of secure software development has progressed immensely between 2002 and 2007, and incorporating them will make Windows Server 2008 much more able to stand up to the threats we will see in the next five years. By the way, it is with a heavy heart that I say that, as I worked hard on security in Windows Server 2003, but it is true.Apart from the engineering process, the first thing people will notice is the completely new management model in Windows Server 2008. Instead of installing a lot of separate components, you now deploy roles to the server. This makes a lot of sense because the roles are what you bought the server to fill. By implementing that metaphor in the management tools the risk for misconfiguration is greatly reduced.The new kernel features are also very important and will make a big difference for many. First, the new virtualization features are fundamentally going to change how we build and run data centers. The improvements in security, reliability, and performance in the kernel features, such as thread scheduling, and in the networking features, such as the new network file system, also are going to be valuable to many.What do you feel is the biggest security oversight made by network admins?Put a slightly different way, the area where I see the most room for improvement is in security posture management. Administrators are far too focused on vulnerabilities and on the types of \"hardening\" tweaks that were useful in the 1990s, when software shipped wide open by default. Today, those things are not nearly as important as it is to manage the security posture of your servers. Far too many administrators still believe in the perimeter and fail to recognize that just about every organizational network today is semi-hostile, at best. The biggest security oversight is not to analyze and manage the threats posed to servers by other actors on the network. The Security Resource Kit goes into depth in discussing what I refer to as Network Threat Modeling, as the analysis phase of Server and Domain Isolation – probably the most powerful security tool in the arsenal today. Yet, the proportion of networks that use these tools is infinitesimal.What are your thoughts on the constant hype surrounding potential security flaws in Vista?As I have written elsewhere (http://msinfluentials.com/blogs/jesper/?archive/2008/01/24/do-vista-users-need-?fewer-patches-than-xp-users.aspx) I fail to see any data backing up the argument. Certainly, there have been flaws in Vista – and anyone who expected it to be flawless was unrealistic – but the improvements are tremendous over Windows XP. Windows Vista has about half as many critical problems as Windows XP in the same time-frame. I'm not sure that it would have been reasonable to expect it to perform much better than that given how large and complex modern software is and how fast the security landscape is moving.Therefore, I have to think that the reasons for the hype are something other than data. The popular press seems to operate on the assumption that complaining about Microsoft generates advertising revenue, and they are probably correct. The fact of the matter today is that a significant portion of the software industry, specifically the security portion, has built its business almost exclusively on selling software that purports to protect Microsoft's customers from Microsoft's screw-ups. It is simply terrifying to it, and a grave threat to its business model, that Microsoft should actually manage to produce software, and particularly operating systems, that are so secure they do not need most of the products that portion of the industry sells.The popular press, being a largely advertising funded business, has happily latched on to this perception and boosted the unsubstantiated claims of Windows Vista's vulnerability to the benefit of their major advertisers. It is truly a sick eco-system that harms the customer in both the short and long term. The threats today, as I mentioned above, are trending toward the types of things that the security software industry cannot protect against. The new threats are against people, and the focus needs to shift to helping people make better security decisions and take responsibility for their own actions. Unfortunately, the current unsubstantiated hype about Windows Vista is not about protecting customers, it is about selling unnecessary security software and inculcating users and IT managers alike in the belief that they must buy third party software to run Windows safely; a belief that, with a few notable exceptions, such as anti-virus software, is falsified by the data. In fact, the hype has even lead to a huge growth industry in malicious, fake, security software. I have seen a lot of people lured by the hype into buying security software that is not security software at all, but simply malware in disguise. The average consumer, inundated with hype, is unable to make out what to really believe. This sick ecosystem is harmful and the press and the pundits are not helping, but only increasing the hype.In your opinion, which network faces the biggest security risk today: the small office with multiple power users or large corporation with a large LUA base?The unmanaged networks. I have seen very well managed and very secure networks in both small and large organizations, and I have seen poorly managed and very insecure networks in both as well. It is not really a matter of size but of how much time and effort is put into the security aspects of it. One of the largest weaknesses seems to be training. Security today is about end-points. The attacks are against people far more prevalent than those against technology and vulnerabilities. We need to, as an industry, understand how to push the security out to the assets that we are trying to protect. In the past we have centralized security because it was a way to centralize management of security. The challenge now is to de-centralize security, while still permitting centralized management. This is a non-trivial task, but it must be done. As a starting point, I dare every IT manager to start analyzing the risks to his or her network, and specifically, what it is they want the network to be used for. Once you understand what it is you want the network to provide you have a chance to work on making it provide that and nothing else. To me, that is the most important thing we can do. A properly staffed IT group, with adequate training and resources to train its users, an organizational mandate to protect the organization's assets, and a keen understanding of the business they serve will build a network that is adequately secured regardless of the size of the network. Windows Server 2008 certainly provides some very powerful technologies to help you manage security in your network, but while that is a necessary component, it is insufficient by itself. At a very base level, it is about the people and the processes you have, more than about the technology. Technology will help, but it is just a tool that your people will implement using a process that helps or hurts.\n\nVisit the catalog page for Microsoft® Windows Server 2008™ Security Resource KitVisit the errata page for Microsoft® Windows Server 2008™ Security Resource KitDownload the supplemental content for Microsoft® Windows Server 2008™ Security Resource Kit","tags":["Software Development","Operating Systems","MS Operating Systems","Windows","Windows Server"]},{"id":"9781466508422","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Fading and Interference Mitigation in Wireless Communications","authors":["Stefan Panic","Mihajlo Stefanovic","Jelena Anastasov"],"pages":"264","publication_date":"December 2013","description":"Fading and Interference Mitigation in Wireless Communications will help readers stay up to date with recent developments in the performance analysis of space diversity reception over fading channels in the presence of cochannel interference.","tags":["IT Operations","Computer Networking","Wireless Networks"]},{"id":"032126892X","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Data Binding with Windows Forms 2.0: Programming Smart Client Data Applications with .NET","authors":["Brian Noyes"],"pages":"736","publication_date":"January 2006","description":"“Brian Noyes’ writing style easily captures your attention as he elaborates on all aspects of data binding in his book.

The introduction of these new data types has implied some changes in the administration processes and programming techniques. The book Large Objects with DB2 for z/OS and OS/390, SG24-6571, introduced and described the usage of LOBs with DB2 for z/OS at Version 7 level. Major enhancements for LOB manipulation have been introduced with DB2 UDB for z/OS Version 8 and DB2 Version 9.1 for z/OS (DB2 9 in this book). These enhancements include performance functions such as the avoidance of LOB locks and DRDA LOB flow optimization, usability functions such as file reference variables, FETCH CONTINUE, and the automatic creation of objects. DB2 utilities provide integrated support with LOAD and UNLOAD, Cross Loader, REORG, CHECK DATA, and CHECK LOB.

Many times, this information is all the programmer requires to correct the problem. However, it might be necessary to delve a little deeper into the code to figure out the problem. Debug Tool allows the programmer to step through the code at whatever level is required to determine where the error was introduced or encountered.\n\nAfter the code or data is corrected, the same process is followed again until no errors are encountered. However, volume testing or testing with multiple terminals is sometimes required to ensure real-world reliability. Workload Simulator can be used to perform this type of testing.\n\nAfter all of the tests are completed, running the application by using Application Performance Analyzer can ensure that no performance bottlenecks are encountered.

IBM System z®, the latest generation of the IBM distinguished family of mainframe systems, has come a long way from its IBM System/360 heritage. Likewise, its IBM z/OS® operating system is far superior to its predecessors in providing, among many other capabilities, world-class and state-of-the-art support for the TCP/IP Internet protocol suite.\n\nTCP/IP is a large and evolving collection of communication protocols managed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), an open, volunteer organization. Because of its openness, the TCP/IP protocol suite has become the foundation for the set of technologies that form the basis of the Internet. The convergence of IBM mainframe capabilities with Internet technology, connectivity, and standards (particularly TCP/IP) is dramatically changing the face of information technology and driving requirements for ever more secure, scalable, and highly available mainframe TCP/IP implementations.\n\nThe IBM z/OS Communications Server TCP/IP Implementation series provides understandable, step-by-step guidance about how to enable the most commonly used and important functions of z/OS Communications Server TCP/IP.\n\nThis IBM Redbooks® publication is for people who install and support z/OS Communications Server. It explains how to set up security for your z/OS networking environment. Network security requirements have become more stringent and complex. Because many transactions are from unknown users and untrusted networks, careful attention must be given to host and user authentication, data privacy, data origin authentication, and data integrity. Also, because security technologies are complex and can be confusing, we include helpful tutorial information in the appendixes of this book.","tags":["Software Development","Operating Systems","z/OS"]},{"id":"9781555583477","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Microsoft Exchange Server 2007: Tony Redmond's Guide to Successful Implementation","authors":["Tony Redmond"],"pages":"1056","publication_date":"May 2007","description":"Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 marks the biggest advancement in the history of the Exchange Product group.

In addition, the quest for global profits has created worldwide competition for the corporate suite, and U.S.-born minorities and whites are losing out. This isn’t only a civil rights issue, as studies have shown that businesses with a strong commitment to diversity outperform their peers.

By connecting the virtual community with the local environment, mobile social networks (MSNs) create the opportunity for a multitude of new personalized services for mobile users. Along with that comes the need for new paradigms, mechanisms, and techniques with the capacity to autonomously manage their functioning and evolution.Currently, most books about mobile networks focus mainly on the technical point of view. Mobile Social Networking and Computing: A Multidisciplinary Integrated Perspective not only addresses the theoretical aspects of MSN and computing, but also introduces and categorizes existing applications. It supplies a multidisciplinary perspective that considers the technology, economics, social sciences, and psychology behind MSNs.In addition to fundamental theory, the book investigates the practical issues in MSN, including characteristics, inner structural relationship, incentive mechanisms, resource allocating, information diffusion, search, ranking, privacy, trust, and reputation. Introducing recently developed technologies, modes, and models, the book provides two distinct (but related) viewpoints about MSN applications: socially inspired networking technology and networking technology that uses recent advancements to enhance quality of life.The text illustrates the interaction between the macrolevel structure and the local rational behaviors (microlevel) in MSN. It summarizes currently available MSN development platforms, including Android and iOS, and introduces and categorizes existing applications related to MSN and computing.Both location-based service (LBS) and mobile social networks in proximity (MSNPs) are presented in a comprehensive manner. Highlighting key research opportunities, this much-needed reference outlines incentive mechanisms inspired by classical economics, behavioral economics, and social psychology, and, perhaps for the first time, it presents a summary of the economic and business models of MSNs.","tags":["Hardware","Wireless Technology","Telecommunications"]},{"id":"9781523001378","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Ending Checkbox Diversity","authors":["Dannie Lynn Fountain"],"pages":"160","publication_date":"October 2022","description":"A Google strategist shows how companies can move beyond performative allyship into the authentic enactment of diversity, equity, and inclusion.","tags":["Business","Human Resources","Workforce Diversity","Diversity and Inclusion"]},{"id":"9780735651234","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Microsoft® Exchange Server 2010 Inside Out","authors":["Tony Redmond"],"pages":"1248","publication_date":"November 2010","description":"Dive into Exchange Server 2010 and SP1—and discover how to really put your messaging solutions to work!

It starts with a discussion of virtual IP addressing (VIPA) for high-availability, with and without a dynamic routing protocol. It describes several workload balancing approaches with the z/OS Communications Server. It also explains optimized Sysplex Distributor intra-sysplex load balancing.

Zacker"],"pages":"672","publication_date":"January 2003","description":"Windows XP is the latest, most reliable, and best-looking version of the world's most widely used operating system, combining the extremely stable engine of Windows NT and 2000 with the user-friendliness of the Windows 98 and Me consumer models. In its first year, XP became the fastest-selling Windows OS ever. But one major failing remains unaddressed: XP Pro comes without a single page of printed instructions. This superbly written guide fills the gap. Coauthored by David Pogue, New York Times technology columnist and Missing Manuals creator, Windows XP Pro: The Missing Manual uses wit, technical insight, and scrupulous objectivity to light the way for first-time and intermediate PC fans. The book reveals which features work well and which don't, such as the Remote Desktop software that enables people to connect to the office from home, the encryption file system that protects sensitive information, and the Windows Messenger that enables real-time text, voice and video communication. Contents include: Getting started. The book's early chapters cover using menus, finding lost files, reducing window clutter, and taming the new, multi-column Start menu. Mastering the network. Special chapters help you navigate the corporate network, dial in from the road, and even set up your own small-office (peer-to-peer) network, step by step. Understanding security. User accounts, file encryption, and the NTFS file system keep your private files private, while still offering network access to coworkers you specify. Flying the Net. This book demystifies Outlook Express 6 for email, Internet Explorer 6 for Web browsing, and the new Windows Messenger for voice, chat, and video conferencing. Windows XP Pro: The Missing Manual isn't for system administrators or OS theory geeks; it's for the novice or budding power user who wants to master the machine and get down to work. Yet, anyone who uses XP Pro (including hardcore techies) will find this new system much easier -- and more fun -- to digest with this new Missing Manual. This is the crystal-clear, jargon-free book that should have been in the box.","tags":["Software Development","Operating Systems","MS Operating Systems","Windows"]},{"id":"9781597495783","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2 Administrator's Reference","authors":["Dustin Hannifin"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"August 2010","description":"Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2: The Administrators Essential Reference introduces the Windows Server 2008 R2, which is Microsofts flagship server operating systems latest release.

If significant resource investments are placed in mature systems, IT organizations need to balance old and new technology. Older technology, such as non-IBM pre-relational databases, is costly, inflexible, and non-standard. Users store their information on the mainframe and thus preserve the skills and qualities of service their business needs.

Written for developers with a good handle on TFS basics, this book shows you how to solve real-life problems. It's not a repetition of Microsoft's product documentation. Team Foundation Server 2008 in Action is a practitioner's handbook for how to work with TFS under common constraints. This book walks you through real-life software engineering problems based on hundreds of hours of TFS experience.\n\nYou'll benefit from expert author Jamil Azher's extensive interactions with members of Microsoft's TFS team and MVPs, survey feedback from the author's blog, and interviews with organizations and user groups using TFS. Instead of just offering a high-level overview, the book provides detailed solutions for solving common—and not-so-common—problems using TFS. It discusses the strengths as well as weaknesses of TFS, and suggests appropriate problem resolution steps, workarounds, or custom solutions.\n\nAbout the Technology\n\nIn complex software projects, managing the development process can be as critical to success as writing the code itself. A project may involve dozens of developers, managers, architects, testers, and customers, hundreds of builds, and thousands of opportunities to get off-track. To keep tabs on the people, tasks, and components of a medium- to large-scale project, most teams use a development system that allows for easy monitoring, follow-up, and accountability.\n\nMicrosoft Team Foundation Server 2008 (TFS), the server component of Microsoft's Visual Studio Team System (VSTS), provides a powerful collaborative platform for software-development teams. The product offers an integrated toolset for tracking work items, creating test cases, managing source code, generating builds, constructing database schemas, and so on. Because in software development one size does not fit all, TFS provides process customization, project management, and reporting capabilities to build solutions around your requirements.\n\nAbout the BookWhat's Inside\nDetailed, bottom-up solutions to real-life problems using TFS\nTFS for database professionals\nVisual Studio 2008 TFS\nAbout the ReaderAbout the Author\n\nJamil Azher has over 18 years of experience in software development ranging from hands-on programming, global project management, technology leadership, and entrepreneurial ventures.

In case you have ever wondered how high this throughput really is, this book is the right read for you: At first, it presents results from experimental research and simulations of the physical layer of HSDPA, WiMAX, and LTE. Next, it explains in detail how measurements on such systems need to be performed in order to achieve reproducible and repeatable results. The book further addresses how wireless links can be evaluated by means of standard-compliant link-level simulation. The major challenge in this context is their complexity when investigating complete wireless cellular networks. Consequently, it is shown how system-level simulators with a higher abstraction level can be designed such that their results still match link-level simulations. Exemplarily, the book finally presents optimizations of wireless systems over several cells.\n\nThis book:\n\nExplains how the performance of modern cellular wireless networks can be evaluated by measurements and simulations\n\nDiscusses the concept of testbeds, highlighting the challenges and expectations when building them\n\nExplains measurement techniques, including the evaluation of the measurement quality by statistical inference techniques\n\nPresents throughput results for HSDPA, WiMAX, and LTE\n\nDemonstrates simulators at both, link- level and system-level\n\nProvides system-level and link-level simulators (for WiMAX and LTE) on an accompanying website (https://www.nt.tuwien.ac.at/downloads/featured-downloads)\n\nThis book is an insightful guide for researchers and engineers working in the field of mobile radio communication as well as network planning.

Major databases, authoring tools (including Microsoft's Office 2000), and browsers are committed to XML support. Many content creators and programmers for the Web and other media are left wondering, \"What can XML and its associated standards really do for me?\" Getting the most from XML requires being able to tag and transform XML documents so they can be processed by web browsers, databases, mobile phones, printers, XML processors, voice response systems, and LDAP directories, just to name a few targets. In Learning XML, the author explains XML and its capabilities succinctly and professionally, with references to real-life projects and other cogent examples. Learning XML shows the purpose of XML markup itself, the CSS and XSL styling languages, and the XLink and XPointer specifications for creating rich link structures. The basic advantages of XML over HTML are that XML lets a web designer define tags that are meaningful for the particular documents or database output to be used, and that it enforces an unambiguous structure that supports error-checking. XML supports enhanced styling and linking standards (allowing, for instance, simultaneous linking to the same document in multiple languages) and a range of new applications. For writers producing XML documents, this book demystifies files and the process of creating them with the appropriate structure and format.

Thus, one way of viewing operating systems is as resource managers. Before job processing, operating systems reserve input and output resources for jobs. During job processing, operating systems manage resources such as processors and storage. After job processing, operating systems free all resources used by the completed jobs, making the resources available to other jobs. This process is called resource management.There is more to the processing of jobs than the managing of resources needed by the jobs. At any instant, a number of jobs can be in various stages of preparation, processing, and post-processing activity. To use resources efficiently, operating systems divide jobs into parts. They distribute the parts of jobs to queues to wait for needed resources. Keeping track of where things are and routing work from queue to queue is called workflow management, and is a major function of any operating system.JES3 considers job priorities, device and processor alternatives, and installation-specified preferences in preparing jobs for processing job output.

The best organizations have become genuine cross-cultural communities that believe equally in reconciling differences and valuing them. To that end, The Diversity Code promotes understanding by answering many of the toughest questions that professionals and their employers are often afraid to ask, including: • How do you define diversity—what it is and isn’t? • Am I “safe” simply following the law? • Can’t we just acknowledge that we are the same and different—then get on with our work? • How do I handle diversity problems on my staff—or worse, with people who outrank me? • What do I do if I’m accused of something? • How do I institute change without ticking people off?

For information technology professionals, WCF supplies an impressive array of administration tools that enterprises and software vendors can use to reduce the cost of ownership of their solutions without writing a single line of code. Most important, WCF delivers on the promise of model-driven software development with the new software factory approach, by which one can iteratively design solutions in a modeling language and generate\n\nexecutables from lower-level class libraries.\n\nWindows Communication Foundation 3.5 Unleashed is designed to be the essential resource for software developers and architects working with WCF. The book guides readers through a conceptual understanding of all the facilities of WCF and provides step-by-step guides to applying the technology to practical problems.\n\nAs evangelists at Microsoft for WCF, WF, and CardSpace, Craig McMurtry, Marc Mercuri, Nigel Watling, and Matt Winkler are uniquely positioned to write this book. They had access to the development team and to the product as it was being built. Their work with enterprises and outside software vendors has given them unique insight into how others see the software, how they want to apply it, and the challenges they face in doing so.\n\n--Gives you nearly 100 best practices for programming with WCF\n\n--Provides detailed coverage of how to version services that you will not find anywhere else\n\n--Delves into using WCF together with Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) and Windows CardSpace\n\n--Provides detailed coverage of the new high-performance data contract serializer for .NET\n\n--Walks you through creating secure, reliable, transacted messaging, and how to understand the available options\n\n--Introduces you to federated, claims-based security and shows you how to incorporate SAML and WS-Trust security token services into your architecture\n\n--Provides step-by-step instructions for how to customize every aspect of WCF\n\n--Shows you how to add behaviors, communication channels, message encoders, and transports\n\n--Presents options for implementing publish/subscribe solutions\n\n--Gives clear guidance on peer-to-peer communications with WCF","tags":["Software Development","Programming Languages",".NET","Windows Communication Foundation"]},{"id":"9781786301734","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Wi-Fi Integration to the 4G Mobile Network","authors":["André Pérez"],"pages":"288","publication_date":"May 2018","description":"The adoption of smartphones has had as a corollary the use of services that require streaming, such as video streaming, which is a constraint for the 4G mobile network. The integration of the network of Wi-Fi hotspots deployed by the operators adds capacity to the 4G mobile network.The use of Wi-Fi technology in carrier networks is the result of developments coordinated by the IEEE, WFA and WBA standardization bodies. For its part, the 3GPP standardization body has been working to integrate Wi-Fi technology into the 4G mobile network.The first part of this book presents the characteristics of the Wi-Fi radio interface. The different IEEE 802.11b / g / n / ac physical layers characterize the implementation in the 2.4 GHz ISM frequency bands and U- NII at 5 GHz. The MAC layer defines a number of media access procedures such as scanning, associating, or transferring data.The second part of this book deals with the architecture of the 4G network based on the Wi-Fi interface. This architecture defines several models corresponding, on the one hand, to Wi-Fi access controlled or not, On the other hand, to a handover controlled by the network or by the mobile. The integration of Wi-Fi technology resulted in a redefinition of attachment and session set-up procedures.Smartphones have the ability to activate simultaneously the two radio interfaces, LTE and Wi-Fi, which allows to direct certain services to one and / or the other of the interfaces. The ANDSF and HotSpot 2.0 functions provide the mobile with rules for network selection and traffic control to determine which traffic is to be routed to what type of interface.","tags":["IT Operations","Computer Networking","Wireless Networks","LTE"]},{"id":"9780470525227","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Professional Xcode® 3","authors":["James Bucanek"],"pages":"743","publication_date":"March 2010","description":"A solid guide that responds to the active interest in Apple's Xcode tools\n\nApple's Xcode tools are a collection of applications and frameworks that are used to develop, test, and optimize applications primarily written for Mac OS X or the iPhone.

A time saver for sure, but it's new!\n\nDr. Rory Lewis, Yulia McCarthy and Stephen Moraco — a best selling Apress author, a former Apple iOS engineering group intern and a successful app developer — have teamed up to bring you this book, Beginning iOS Storyboarding. The three authors have found a beautiful way to lead the beginner into Storyboarding and at the same time show old school coders of Objective-C the new and exquisite methodology of this incredible tool.\n\nFor the beginner who has never programmed, Beginning iOS Storyboarding shows how to extract those cool and innovative app ideas you have in your head into a working app ready for sale on the iTunes store by using Apple's new technology that allows you to skip chunks of code by just dragging scenes and segues onto your Storyboard canvas.\n\nEven if you're an intermediate or pro-level Objective-C developer, you can still learn the ins and outs of Xcode's new Storyboarding feature, and find new ways of building and debugging your new Storyboarding app. Yup: This book is also for you, too.\n\nIn this book, you get the following, beyond learning the fundamentals and classical elements of Storyboarding:\n\nDesign and build utilities and a location based service app using Storyboarding techniques\n\nDesign and build a universal app with a rich user interface and user experience (UX)\n\nCreate a fun game app, and more\n\nWhat you'll learn\n\nHow iOS Storyboarding is like a different planet in the Xcode universe. We do this by introducing you to the standard transitions to views, passing data to the views, returning data from the views, and, lastly, showing how to navigate the critical transitions to views.\n\nHow to develop a simple utility app using Storyboarding. Here we learn the foundation of many apps, which is how to place controls on the settings screen of a utility application and to return those settings to the main view of the app via the settings view delegate protocol.\n\nHow to develop an app with an advanced MKMapView. Specifically, we introduce you to override the default views provided by Apple's initial project templates.

Despite efforts that have been made in the last few decades, gender and racioethnic equity still hasn’t been achieved. What's worse, Black, Indigenous, Asian, and Latina women are being held back more than their White counterparts.\n\nWe need to change how we strive for equity. We must move beyond individual solutions toward collective action, where people from historically power-dominant and marginalized groups work together, so that all women experience the benefits of professional growth and equity. We need Shared Sisterhood, and anyone, regardless of gender, can join in.\n\nProfessor Tina Opie first started Shared Sisterhood as a movement to drive gender and racial equity in organizations. Since then, she and professor Beth A. Livingston have worked together to spread the word to leaders across organizations, with thousands of followers joining the cause. In this book, they explain how to use vulnerability, trust, empathy, and risk-taking to build Shared Sisterhood and break down three key parts of the process:\n\nDig into your own assumptions around racioethnicity, gender, and power\nBridge the divide between women of all backgrounds through authentic relationships\nAdvance all women across the organization and beyond\n\nBalancing a mix of history, research, and real-life examples—including the authors' own experiences—this book encourages everyone to join Shared Sisterhood and advance equity for all.","tags":["Business","Human Resources","Workforce Diversity"]},{"id":"9780874259803","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"50 Activities for Diversity Training","authors":["Jonamay Lambert"],"pages":"300","publication_date":"January 1994","description":"Part of our best-selling 50 Activities series!

This release continues to deliver industry leadership for security. Improvements have been introduced to further enhance the security-rich environment z/OS users rely on. These enhancements include:\n\n- RACF support for virtual key rings to treat the collection of all the certificates owned by one user ID, including the SITE and CERTAUTH reserved user IDs, as an independent key ring. The use of the CERTAUTH virtual key ring will help to eliminate the need to manually create multiple real key rings for SSL-enabled z/OS client applications such as FTP.\n\n- RACF template extensions allow templates to expand beyond their current 4K size.\n\n- RACF supports the use of passwords longer than eight characters, now called password phrases.\n\n- The RACF access control module exit, DSNXRXAC, has changed substantially with DB2® version 9. A RACF administrators can now define a security rule before an object is created and preserve the rule for a dropped object. In addition, RACF general resources for member and group profiles can be used by an installation to protect multiple DB2 resources with a single RACF profile.\n\n- A new parameter on the IRRUT200 utility tells the utility to activate the backup data set printed to as output. This is accomplished by the utility internally issuing an RVARY ACTIVE for the backup data set after the copy is complete. IRRUT200 and IRRUT400 utilities now check whether their output data sets are active primary or backup RACF data sets on this system. New RACF health checks are introduced.\n\n- RACF in z/OS V1R8 provides a solution to some functional gaps in the way that change logging of RACF profile updates were reflected in z/OS LDAP, and an enhancement is made to LISTUSER to demonstrate whether password enveloping is enabled for a user.\n\nIn addition to describing the new features, this book includes detailed steps for implementing these enhancements.

Joint source-channel decoding is now seen as a viable alternative to separate decoding of source and channel codes, if the protocol layers are taken into account. A joint source/protocol/channel approach is thus addressed in this book: all levels of the protocol stack are considered, showing how the information in each layer influences the others.\n\nThis book provides the tools to show how cross-layer and joint source-channel coding and decoding are now compatible with present-day mobile and wireless networks, with a particular application to the key area of video transmission to mobiles. Typical applications are broadcasting, or point-to-point delivery of multimedia contents, which are very timely in the context of the current development of mobile services such as audio (MPEG4 AAC) or video (H263, H264) transmission using recent wireless transmission standards (DVH-H, DVB-SH, WiMAX, LTE).\n\nThis cross-disciplinary book is ideal for graduate students, researchers, and more generally professionals working either in signal processing for communications or in networking applications, interested in reliable multimedia transmission. This book is also of interest to people involved in cross-layer optimization of mobile networks. Its content may provide them with other points of view on their optimization problem, enlarging the set of tools which they could use.\n\nPierre Duhamel is director of research at CNRS/ LSS and has previously held research positions at Thomson-CSF, CNET, and ENST, where he was head of the Signal and Image Processing Department.

The IBM System z®, the latest generation of the IBM distinguished family of mainframe systems, has come a long way from its IBM System/360 heritage. Likewise, its IBM z/OS® operating system is far superior to its predecessors, providing, among many other capabilities, world-class, state-of-the-art, support for the TCP/IP Internet protocol suite.\n\nTCP/IP is a large and evolving collection of communication protocols managed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), an open, volunteer, organization. Because of its openness, the TCP/IP protocol suite has become the foundation for the set of technologies that form the basis of the Internet. The convergence of IBM mainframe capabilities with Internet technology, connectivity, and standards (particularly TCP/IP) is dramatically changing the face of information technology and driving requirements for ever more secure, scalable, and highly available mainframe TCP/IP implementations.\n\nThe IBM z/OS Communications Server TCP/IP Implementation series provides understandable, step-by-step guidance about how to enable the most commonly used and important functions of z/OS Communications Server TCP/IP.\n\nThis IBM Redbooks® publication provides useful implementation scenarios and configuration recommendations for many of the TCP/IP standard applications that z/OS Communications Server supports.\n\nFor more specific information about z/OS Communications Server standard applications, high availability, and security, see the other volumes in the series:\n\nIBM z/OS V1R13 Communications Server TCP/IP Implementation: Volume 1 Base Functions, Connectivity, and Routing, SG24-7996\n\nIBM z/OS V1R13 Communications Server TCP/IP Implementation: Volume 3 High Availability, Scalability, and Performance, SG24-7998\n\nIBM z/OS V1R13 Communications Server TCP/IP Implementation: Volume 4 Security and Policy-Based Networking, SG24-7999\n\nFor comprehensive descriptions of the individual parameters for setting up and using the functions that we describe in this book, along with step-by-step checklists and supporting examples, see the following publications:\n\nz/OS Communications Server: IP Configuration Guide, SC31-8775\n\nz/OS Communications Server: IP Configuration Reference, SC31-8776\n\nz/OS Communications Server: IP User's Guide and Commands, SC31-8780\n\nThis book does not duplicate the information in those publications.

Although limited XML-to-HTML conversion is possible within some browsers, web developers creating dynamic or complex sites will find server-side XML transformation a necessity. Unfortunately, until recently, there have been few XML tools available for server-side XML transformation or authoring. AxKit, a mod_perl and Apache-based XML content delivery solution, was designed to meet that need with a cost-effective and efficient plugin architecture. AxKit allows the developer to quickly design modules to create faster web sites, and deliver them in a wide variety of media formats. AxKit also takes care of caching so the developer doesn't have to worry about it. AxKit meets the demands of the web developer nicely, but, as with any new toolkit, there is a learning curve. For developers who want to flatten that learning curve and get right to work with AxKit, XML Publishing with AxKit provides detailed information on how to install, configure, and deploy AxKit effectively. The first book solely devoted to AxKit, XML Publishing with AxKit also offers a concise and focused look at how to create XSLT and XPathScript-based pipelines for XML data transfer. This solidly useful new book presents web programmers with the hands-on knowledge they need to get really creative with AxKit. It features a thorough introduction to XSP (extensible Server Pages), which applies the concepts of Server Pages technologies (embedded code, tag libraries, etc) to the XML world, and covers integrating AxKit with other tools such as Template Toolkit, Apache:: Mason, Apache::ASP, and plain CGI. The book also includes invaluable reference sections on configuration directives, XPathScript, and XSP. With XML Publishing with AxKit, web developers will have all the tools they need to deliver complex XML-based systems quickly, the power to develop their own systems for style sheet negotiation, and the flexibility to design completely new style sheet languages. XML Publishing with AxKit gives those new to XML all the background and the courage they need to jump right in and deploy AxKit. And it gives XML-savvy professionals everything they need to hit the ground running.","tags":["Data","Data Engineering","Storage Formats","XML"]},{"id":"9781430249832","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"CSS for Windows 8 App Development","authors":["Jeremy Foster"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"February 2013","description":"CSS for Windows 8 App Development is your learning guide for CSS – the language of great Windows 8-style apps.

So if you are a system architect or solution designer and you need to make decisions about SOA enablement or transitioning on the z/OS platform, this book offers an excellent starting point. It describes patterns, transition approaches, migration scenarios, and the features and functions of the available technology options. And specialists who are interested in technical details of the solutions will also find plenty of useful information. Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is a hot topic on the agendas of many CIOs and architects. But the bright and shining landscape of an SOA, with all the advantages it offers, is quite different from the reality that currently exists in many IT environments; the IT is too complex, too tightly integrated, and too inflexible. The time to market of IT changes is often unacceptably long, and organizations are often not ready for an SOA. And although many IT professionals believe that SOA will make IT more flexible and significantly reduce the time to market, the challenge of how to execute toward a full-blown SOA implementation still remains.This publication will help you to meet that challenge. It helps you define an SOA strategy on z/OS, follow the appropriate implementation steps, and decide what technology to use. Much of the information is applicable to non-z/OS platforms as well.","tags":["Software Development","Operating Systems","z/OS"]},{"id":"0738492760","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"OSA-Express Integrated Console Controller Implementation Guide","authors":["Bill White","Jeff Nesbitt"],"pages":"164","publication_date":"October 2005","description":"This IBM Redbooks publication discusses how to plan, implement, and configure the Open Systems Adapter-Express Integrated Console Controller (OSA-ICC) function.

Many CPU reductions are built in directly to DB2, requiring no application changes. Some enhancements are implemented through normal DB2 activities through rebinding, restructuring database definitions, improving applications, and utility processing. The CPU demand reduction features have the potential to provide significant total cost of ownership savings based on the application mix and transaction types.\n\nImprovements in optimization reduce costs by processing SQL automatically with more efficient data access paths. Improvements through a range-list index scan access method, list prefetch for IN-list, more parallelism for select and index insert processing, better work file usage, better record identifier (RID) pool overflow management, improved sequential detection, faster log I/O, access path certainty evaluation for static SQL, and improved distributed data facility (DDF) transaction flow all provide more efficiency without changes to applications. These enhancements can reduce total CPU enterprise costs because of improved efficiency in the DB2 10 for z/OS.\n\nDB2 10 includes numerous performance enhancements for Large Objects (LOBs) that save disk space for small LOBs and that provide dramatically better performance for LOB retrieval, inserts, load, and import/export using DB2 utilities.

In years past, it took a trained technician to set up and manage a computer network; that's not the case anymore. With more and more households having multiple PCs, there is an increased demand to network those PCs to share files, peripherals, and an Internet connection. And it's become much easier to create a home network, thanks to easier-to-use wireless networking technologies and equipment. The problem is setting up a wireless network can still be somewhat confusing, and often difficult. Even setting up a simple wireless network to share an Internet connection can be a frustrating trial-and-error process. What kind of wireless network should you choose -- 802.11a, b, g, or n? What equipment do you need? How do you configure all your computers to work on the network? How do you share a single printer on your network? The confusion continues when one considers the different issues related to different operating systems. Setting up a wireless network under Windows Vista is much different than setting up a similar network under Windows XP. Users are looking for simple answers to all these questions. Unfortunately, most networking books today are geared toward technology-savvy networking professionals. Where does the average user turn to for solutions to his wireless networking problems?

The result is default settings that restrict flexibility, interminable wizards that turn two-step tasks into twelve-step sagas, and the hiding of powerful and useful programs behind layers of menus and dialog boxes.

Instead, this book offers shortcuts for boosting your productivity, customizations for making Windows Vista work the way you do, workarounds for known Windows Vista problems, and warnings for avoiding Windows Vista pitfalls.

These applications can also send XML content to other applications for updating or for use in different situations.\n\nActionScript 3.0 introduced some fundamental changes to the way in which Flash and Flex applications work with XML. One significant change is that XML is now a native data type. ActionScript 3.0 also introduced new classes and a different framework for working with external documents. These changes are based on the E4X ECMAScript standard, and they streamline and simplify the process for working with XML in Flash and Flex.\n\nIn Foundation XML and E4X for Flash and Flex, Sas Jacobs gives you an introduction to XML and E4X. She explores the XML and XMLList classes and explains E4X expressions, providing examples for both Flash and Flex. In addition to explaining how to incorporate XML documents in Shockwave Flash applications, Sas shows you approaches specific to Flash and Flex and explores real-world usage. The book finishes with two case studies. In the first, you will learn how to consume and display information and images from Flickr using Flash. In the second, you will work with Adobe Kuler in Flex.\n\nWhether you are a designer or developer, this book will help you work with XML and make the transition from ActionScript 2.0 to ActionScript 3.0. It will also provide you with an excellent grounding if you are new to Flash and Flex.","tags":["Data","Data Engineering","Storage Formats","XML"]},{"id":"9780738459141","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"zPDT Sysplex Extensions - 2020","authors":["Frank Kyne","Bill Ogden"],"pages":"180","publication_date":"October 2020","description":"This IBM® Redbooks® publication describes the IBM System z® Personal Development Tool (IBM zPDT®) Sysplex Extensions 2020, which is a package that consists of sample files and supporting documentation to help you get a functioning, data sharing sysplex up and running with minimal time and effort. This book is a significant revision of zPDT 2017 Sysplex Extensions, SG24-8386.\n\nThis package is designed and tested to be installed on top of a standard Application Developer Controlled Distribution (ADCD) environment. It provides the extra files that you need to create a two-way data sharing IBM z/OS® 2.4 sysplex that runs under IBM z/VM® in a zPDT environment.\n\nThis package differs from the zPDT sysplex package delivered in IBM zPDT Guide and Reference System z Personal Development Tool, SG24-8205, in that it provides working examples of more sysplex exploiters. It also is designed to adhere to IBM's sysplex best practice recommendations, in as far as is possible in a zPDT environment.\n\nAlthough the package was not tested with IBM Z® Development and Test Environment (previously known as RD&T), it may be used to reduce the effort to create a fully functional sysplex under zD&T.\n\nConceptually, the package might also be restored and used as a template to create a sysplex environment that is running on a real IBM Z CPC.\n\nThe target audience for this document is system programmers who are responsible for designing, creating, and maintaining IBM Parallel Sysplex® environments.

Based on groundbreaking research that spanned eight years, Our Separate Ways compares and contrasts the experiences of 120 black and white female managers in the American business arena. In-depth histories bring to life the women's powerful and often difficult journeys from childhood to professional success, highlighting the roles that gender, race, and class played in their development.\n\nAlthough successful professional women come from widely diverse family backgrounds, educational experiences, and community values, they share a common assumption upon entering the workforce: \"I have a chance.\" Along the way, however, they discover that people question their authority, challenge their intelligence, and discount their ideas. And while gender is a common denominator among these women, race and class are often wedges between them.\n\nIn Our Separate Ways, you will find candid discussions about stereotypes, learn how black women's early experiences affect their attitudes in the business world, become aware of how white women have--perhaps unwittingly--aligned themselves more often with white men than with black women, and see ways that our country continues to come to terms with diversity in all of its dimensions.\n\nWhether you are a human resources director wondering why you're having trouble retaining black women, a white female manager considering the role of race in your office, or a black female manager searching for perspectives, you will find fresh insights about how black and white women's struggles differ and encounter provocative ideas for creating a better workplace environment for everyone.","tags":["Business","Human Resources","Workforce Diversity"]},{"id":"9780132174381","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Using Microsoft Windows Live","authors":["Mark Edward Soper"],"pages":"504","publication_date":"December 2011","description":"More than just a book!\n\nLearn how to use Microsoft’s free Windows® Live tools to stay connected, make the most of your media, and stay safe online.

A handful of smart companies have tapped into the opportunities of today’s female consumer base and talent poolyet too many companies still struggle with an outdated and ineffective imbalance of genders, across all levels, functions, and geographies.Now, Avivah Wittenberg-Cox brings a practical, seasoned voice to the problem of gender imbalance in business, laying out proven actions designed to make gender balance a sustainable reality. Wittenberg-Cox, CEO of the consultancy 20-first, has worked with some of the world’s largest and most reputable firms to deliver the benefits of balance. In this HBR Single ebook, she outlines what companies need to do to bring about real change. Beyond the usual well-intentioned but often ineffective mentoring and networking programs for women, the author argues that building gender balance is a twenty-first century management and leadership skill. Bringing a business into successful gender balance requires leaders who have a strategic understanding of the considerable economic benefits that lie untapped in the female populationin their roles both as customers and as talentand the competencies needed to work across genders.It’s time for businesses to tap into 100% of the talent pool and connect with 100% of the marketboth male and female. Wittenberg-Cox tells us how and why gender balance needs to happen nowand how to achieve it.HBR Singles provide brief yet potent business ideas, in digital form, for today’s thinking professional.","tags":["Business","Human Resources","Workforce Diversity"]},{"id":"9780133105056","language":"en","level":null,"title":"Windows® 8 On Demand, Second Edition","authors":["Steve Johnson"],"pages":"576","publication_date":"October 2012","description":"Need answers quickly?

It assumes no previous knowledge of the language, and many developers have used it as their first introduction to XSLT; however, it is not structured as a tutorial, and there are other books on XSLT that provide a gentler approach for beginners.\n\nThe book does assume a basic knowledge of XML, HTML, and the architecture of the Web, and it is written for experienced programmers. There's no assumption that you know any particular language such as Java or Visual Basic, just that you recognize the concepts that all programming languages have in common.\n\nThe book is suitable both for XSLT 1.0 users upgrading to XSLT 2.0, and for newcomers to XSLT. The book is also equally suitable whether you work in the Java or .NET world.\n\nAs befits a reference book, a key aim is that the coverage should be comprehensive and authoritative. It is designed to give you all the details, not just an overview of the 20 percent of the language that most people use 80 percent of the time. It's designed so that you will keep coming back to the book whenever you encounter new and challenging programming tasks, not as a book that you skim quickly and then leave on the shelf. If you like detail, you will enjoy this book; if not, you probably won't.\n\nBut as well as giving the detail, this book aims to explain the concepts, in some depth. It's therefore a book for people who not only want to use the language but who also want to understand it at a deep level.\n\nThe book aims to tell you everything you need to know about the XSLT 2.0 language. It gives equal weight to the things that are new in XSLT 2.0 and the things that were already present in version 1.0. The book is about the language, not about specific products. However, there are appendices about Saxon (the author's own implementation of XSLT 2.0), about the Altova XSLT 2.0 implementation, and about the Java and Microsoft APIs for controlling XSLT transformations, which will no doubt be upgraded to handle XSLT 2.0 as well as 1.0. A third XSLT 2.0 processor, Gestalt, was released shortly before the book went to press, too late to describe it in any detail. But the experience of XSLT 1.0 is that there has been a very high level of interoperability between different XSLT processors, and if you can use one of them, then you can use them all.\n\nIn the previous edition we split XSLT 2.0 and XPath 2.0 into separate volumes. The idea was that some readers might be interested in XPath alone. However, many bought the XSLT 2.0 book without its XPath companion and were left confused as a result; so this time, the material is back together. The XPath reference information is in self-contained chapters, so it should still be accessible when you use XPath in contexts other than XSLT.\n\nThe book does not cover XSL Formatting Objects, a big subject in its own right. Nor does it cover XML Schemas in any detail. If you want to use these important technologies in conjunction with XSLT, there are other books that do them justice.\n\nThis book contains twenty chapters and eight appendixes (the last of which is a glossary) organized into four parts. The following section outlines what you can find in each part, chapter, and appendix.\n\nPart I: Foundations: The first part of the book covers essential concepts. You should read these before you start coding. If you ignore this advice, as most people do, then you read them when you get to that trough of despair when you find it impossible to make the language do anything but the most trivial tasks. XSLT is different from other languages, and to make it work for you, you need to understand how it was designed to be used.\n\nChapter 1: XSLT in Context: This chapter explains how XSLT fits into the big picture: how the language came into being and how it sits alongside other technologies. It also has a few simple coding examples to keep you alert.\n\nChapter 2: The XSLT Processing Model: This is about the architecture of an XSLT processor: the inputs, the outputs, and the data model. Understanding the data model is perhaps the most important thing that distinguishes an XSLT expert from an amateur; it may seem like information that you can't use immediately, but it's knowledge that will stop you making a lot of stupid mistakes.\n\nChapter 3: Stylesheet Structure: XSLT development is about writing stylesheets, and this chapter takes a bird's eye view of what stylesheets look like. It explains the key concepts of rule-based programming using templates, and explains how to undertake programming-in-the-large by structuring your application using modules and pipelines.\n\nChapter 4: Stylesheets and Schemas: A key innovation in XSLT 2.0 is that stylesheets can take advantage of knowledge about the structure of your input and output documents, provided in the form of an XML Schema. This chapter provides a quick overview of XML Schema to describe its impact on XSLT development. Not everyone uses schemas, and you can skip this chapter if you fall into that category.\n\nChapter 5: The Type System: XPath 2.0 and XSLT 2.0 offer strong typing as an alternative to the weak typing approach of the 1.0 languages. This means that you can declare the types of your variables, functions, and parameters, and use this information to get early warning of programming errors. This chapter explains the data types available and the mechanisms for creating user-defined types.\n\nPart II: XSLT and XPath Reference: This section of the book contains reference material, organized in the hope that you can easily find what you need when you need it. It's not designed for sequential reading, though you might well want to leaf through the pages to discover what's there.\n\nChapter 6: XSLT Elements: This monster chapter lists all the XSLT elements you can use in a stylesheet, in alphabetical order, giving detailed rules for the syntax and semantics of each element, advice on usage, and examples. This is probably the part of the book you will use most frequently as you become an expert XSLT user. It's a \"no stone unturned\" approach, based on the belief that as a professional developer you need to know what happens when the going gets tough, not just when the wind is in your direction.\n\nChapter 7: XPath Fundamentals: This chapter explains the basics of XPath: the low-level constructs such as literals, variables, and function calls. It also explains the context rules, which describe how the evaluation of XPath expressions depends on the XSLT processing context in which they appear.\n\nChapter 8: XPath: Operators on Items: XPath offers the usual range of operators for performing arithmetic, boolean comparison, and the like. However, these don't always behave exactly as you would expect, so it's worth reading this chapter to see what's available and how it differs from the last language that you used.\n\nChapter 9: XPath: Path Expressions: Path expressions are what make XPath special; they enable you to navigate around the structure of an XML document. This chapter explains the syntax of path expressions, the 13 axes that you can use to locate the nodes that you need, and associated operators such as union, intersection, and difference.\n\nChapter 10: XPath: Sequence Expressions: Unlike XPath 1.0, in version 2.0 all values are sequences (singletons are just a special case). Some of the most important operators in XPath 2.0 are those that manipulate sequences, notably the \"for\" expression, which translates one sequence into another by applying a mapping.\n\nChapter 11: XPath: Type Expressions: The type system was explained in Chapter 5; this chapter explains the operations that you can use to take advantage of types. This includes the \"cast\" operation which is used to convert values from one type to another.A big part of this chapter is devoted to the detailed rules for how these conversions are done.\n\nChapter 12: XSLT Patterns: This chapter returns from XPath to a subject that's specific to XSLT. Patterns are used to define template rules, the essence of XSLT's rule-based programming approach. The reason for explaining them now is that the syntax and semantics of patterns depends strongly on the corresponding rules for XPath expressions.\n\nChapter 13: The Function Library: XPath 2.0 includes a library of functions that can be called from any XPath expression; XSLT 2.0 extends this with some additional functions that are available only when XPath is used within XSLT. The library has grown immensely since XPath 1.0. This chapter provides a single alphabetical reference for all these functions.\n\nChapter 14: Regular Expressions: Processing of text is an area where XSLT 2.0 and XPath 2.0 are much more powerful than version 1.0, and this is largely through the use of constructs that exploit regular expressions. If you're familiar with regexes from languages such as Perl, this chapter tells you how XPath regular expressions differ. If you're new to the subject, it explains it from first principles.\n\nChapter 15: Serialization: Serialization in XSLT means the ability to generate a textual XML document from the tree structure that's manipulated by a stylesheet. This isn't part of XSLT processing proper, so (following W3C's lead) it's separated it into its own chapter. You can control serialization from the stylesheet using an declaration, but many products also allow you to control it directly via an API.\n\nPart III: Exploitation: The final section of the book is advice and guidance on how to take advantage of XSLT to write real applications. It's intended to make you not just a competent XSLT coder, but a competent designer too. The best way of learning is by studying the work of others, so the emphasis here is on practical case studies.\n\nChapter 16: Extensibility: This chapter describes the \"hooks\" provided in the XSLT specification to allow vendors and users to plug in extra functionality. The way this works will vary from one implementation to another, so we can't cover all possibilities, but one important aspect that the chapter does cover is how to use such extensions and still keep your code portable.\n\nChapter 17: Stylesheet Design Patterns: This chapter explores a number of design and coding patterns for XSLT programming, starting with the simplest \"fill-in-the-blanks\" stylesheet, and extending to the full use of recursive programming in the functional programming style, which is needed to tackle problems of any computational complexity. This provides an opportunity to explain the thinking behind functional programming and the change in mindset needed to take full advantage of this style of development.\n\nChapter 18: Case Study: XMLSpec: XSLT is often used for rendering documents, so where better to look for a case study than the stylesheets used by the W3C to render the XML and XSLT specifications, and others in the same family, for display on the web? The resulting stylesheets are typical of those you will find in any publishing organization that uses XML to develop a series of documents with a compatible look-and-feel.\n\nChapter 19: Case Study: A Family Tree: Displaying a family tree is another typical XSLT application. This example with semi-structured data—a mixture of fairly complex data and narrative text—that can be presented in many different ways for different audiences. It also shows how to tackle another typical XSLT problem, conversion of the data into XML from a legacy text-based format. As it happens, this uses nearly all the important new XSLT 2.0 features in one short stylesheet. But another aim of this chapter is to show a collection of stylesheets doing different jobs as part of a complete application.\n\nChapter 20: Case Study: Knight's Tour: Finding a route around a chessboard where a knight visits every square without ever retracing its steps might sound a fairly esoteric application for XSLT, but it's a good way of showing how even the most complex of algorithms are within the capabilities of the language. You may not need to tackle this particular problem, but if you want to construct an SVG diagram showing progress against your project plan, then the problems won't be that dissimilar.\n\nPart IV: Appendices: Appendix A: XPath 2.0 Syntax Summary: Collects the XPath grammar rules and operator precedences into one place for ease of reference.\n\nAppendix B: Error Codes: A list of all the error codes defined in the XSLT and XPath language specifications, with brief explanations to help you understand what's gone wrong.\n\nAppendix C: Backward Compatibility: The list of things you need to look out for when converting applications from XSLT 1.0.\n\nAppendix D: Microsoft XSLT Processors: Although the two Microsoft XSLT processors don't yet support XSLT 2.0, we thought many readers would find it useful to have a quick summary here of the main objects and methods used in their APIs.\n\nAppendix E: JAXP: the Java API for XML Processing: JAXP is an interface rather than a product. Again, it doesn't have explicit support yet for XSLT 2.0, but Java programmers will often be using it in XSLT 2.0 projects, so the book includes an overview of the classes and methods available.\n\nAppendix F: Saxon: At the time of writing Saxon (developed by the author of this book) provides the most comprehensive implementation of XSLT 2.0 and XPath 2.0, so its interfaces and extensions are covered in some detail.\n\nAppendix G: Altova: Altova, the developers of XML Spy, have an XSLT 2.0 processor that can be used either as part of the development environment or as a freestanding component. This appendix gives details of its interfaces.\n\nAppendix H: Glossary\n\nNote: CD-ROM/DVD and other supplementary materials are not included as part of eBook file.","tags":["Data","Data Engineering","Storage Formats","XML"]},{"id":"9780124199859","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"4G: LTE/LTE-Advanced for Mobile Broadband, 2nd Edition","authors":["Erik Dahlman","Stefan Parkvall","Johan Skold"],"pages":"544","publication_date":"October 2013","description":"This book focuses on LTE with full updates including LTE-Advanced (Release-11) to provide a complete picture of the LTE system.  Detailed explanations are given for the latest LTE standards for radio interface architecture, the physical layer, access procedures, broadcast, relaying, spectrum and RF characteristics, and system performance.\n\nKey technologies presented include multi-carrier transmission, advanced single-carrier transmission, advanced receivers, OFDM, MIMO and adaptive antenna solutions, radio resource management and protocols, and different radio network architectures.

An alternative to DTDs as the way to describe and validate data in an XML environment, XML Schema enables developers to create precise descriptions with a richer set of datatypes?such as booleans, numbers, currencies, dates and times?that are essential for today?s applications.Schemas are powerful, but that power comes with substantial complexity. This concise book explains the ins and outs of XML Schema, including design choices, best practices, and limitations. Particularly valuable are discussions of how the type structures fit with existing database and object-oriented program contexts. With XML Schema, you can define acceptable content models and annotate those models with additional type information, making them more readily bound to programs and objects. Schemas combine the easy interchange of text-based XML with the more stringent requirements of data exchange, and make it easier to validate documents based on namespaces.You?ll find plenty of examples in this book that demonstrate the details necessary for precise vocabulary definitions. Topics include:\n\nFoundations of XML Schema syntax\nFlat, \"russian-doll\", and other schema approaches\nWorking with simple and complex types in a variety of contexts\nThe built-in datatypes provided by XML Schema\nUsing facets to extend datatypes, including regular expression-based patterns\nUsing keys and uniqueness rules to limit how and where information may appear\nCreating extensible schemas and managing extensibility\nDocumenting schemas and extending XML Schema capabilities through annotations\nIn addition to the explanatory content, XML Schemaprovides a complete reference to all parts of both the XML Schema Structures and XML Schema Datatypes specifications, as well as a glossary. Appendices explore the relationships between XML Schema and other tools for describing document structures, including DTDs, RELAX NG, and Schematron, as well as work in progress at the W3C to more tightly integrate XML Schema with existing specifications.No matter how you intend to use XML Schema - for data structures or document structures, for standalone documents or part of SOAP transactions, for documentation, validation, or data binding ? all the foundations you need are outlined in XML Schema.","tags":["Data","Data Engineering","Storage Formats","XML"]},{"id":"9780137885817","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Absolute Beginner's Guide Computer Basics, Windows 11 Edition, 10th Edition","authors":["Michael Miller"],"pages":"368","publication_date":"July 2022","description":"Make the most of your Windows 11 laptop or desktop computer--without becoming a technical expert!

XML, or eXtensible Markup Language, is a specification for storing information. It is also a specification for describing the structure of that information. And while XML is a markup language (just like HTML), XML has no tags of its own. It allows the person writing the XML to create whatever tags they need. The only condition is that these newly created tags adhere to the rules of the XML specification. In the seven years since the first edition of “XML: Visual QuickStart Guide” was published, XML has taken its place next to HTML as a foundational language on the Internet. XML has become a very popular method for storing data and the most popular method for transmitting data between all sorts of systems and applications. The reason being, where HTML was designed to display information, XML was designed to manage it. This book begins by showing you the basics of the XML language. Then, by building on that knowledge, additional and supporting languages and systems will be discussed. To get the most out of this book, you should be somewhat familiar with HTML, although you don’t need to be an expert coder by any stretch. No other previous knowledge is required. “XML: Visual QuickStart Guide, 2nd Edition” is divided into seven parts. Each part contains one or more chapters with step-by-step instructions that explain how to perform XML-related tasks. Wherever possible, examples of the concepts being discussed are displayed, and the parts of the examples on which to focus are highlighted. The order of the book is intentionally designed to be an introduction to the fundamentals of XML, followed by discussions of related XML technologies.     •    In Part 1 of the book, you will learn how to create an XML document. It’s relatively straightforward, and even more so if you know a little HTML.     •    Part 2 focuses on XSL, which is a set of languages designed to transform an XML document into something else: an HTML file, a PDF document, or another XML document. Remember, XML is designed to store and transport data, not display it.     •    Parts 3 and 4 of the book discuss DTD and XML Schema, languages designed to define the structure of an XML document. In conjunction with XML Namespaces (Part 5), you can guarantee that XML documents conform to a pre-defined structure, whether created by you or by someone else.     •    Part 6, Developments and Trends, details some of the up-and-coming XML-related languages, as well as a few new versions of existing languages.     •    Finally, Part 7 identifies some well-known uses of XML in the world today; some of which you may be surprised to learn. This beginner’s guide to XML is broken down as follows:     •    Introduction     •    Chapter 1:  Writing XML     •    Part 2:  XSL     •    Chapter 2:  XSLT     •    Chapter 3:  XPath Patterns and Expressions     •    Chapter 4:  XPath Functions     •    Chapter 5:  XSL-FO     •    Part 3:  DTD     •    Chapter 6:  Creating a DTD     •    Chapter 7:  Entities and Notations in DTDs     •    Chapter 8:  Validation and Using DTDs     •    Part 4:  XML Schema     •    Chapter 9:  XML Schema Basics     •    Chapter 10:  Defining Simple Types     •    Chapter 11:  Defining Complex Types     •    Part 5:  Namespaces     •    Chapter 12:  XML Namespaces     •    Chapter 13:  Using XML Namespaces     •    Part 6:  Recent W3C Recommendations     •    Chapter 14:  XSLT 2.0     •    Chapter 15:  XPath 2.0     •    Chapter 16:  XQuery 1.0     •    Part 7:  XML in Practice     •    Chapter 17:  Ajax, RSS, SOAP and More","tags":["Data","Data Engineering","Storage Formats","XML"]},{"id":"9781787286641","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Learn to Create WordPress Themes by Building 5 Projects","authors":["Eduonix Learning Solutions"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"December 2017","description":"This book takes you step by step into the world of WordPress theme development.

This practical book covers a wide range of antenna array topics that are becoming increasingly important in wireless applications, with emphasis on array design, applications, and computer modeling.\n\nEach chapter in Antenna Arrays builds upon the previous chapter, progressively addressing more difficult material. Beginning with basic electromagnetics/antennas/antenna systems information, the book then deals with the analysis and synthesis of arrays of point sources and their associated array factors. It presents a sampling of different antenna elements that replace these point sources, then presents element configurations that do not have to lie along a line or in a plane.\n\nThe complex and difficult-to-predict interactions of elements and electromagnetic waves are introduced, along with computer modeling and experiments that are necessary for predicting the performance of arrays where mutual coupling is important. Then, various approaches to getting signals to and from the array elements to a computer where the signal detection takes place are explored, as are the numerical techniques behind smart antennas.\n\nThe book emphasizes the computational methods used in the design and analysis of array antennas. Also featured are signal processing and numerical modeling algorithms, as well as pictures of antenna arrays and components provided by industry and government sources, with explanations of how they operate.\n\nFully course-tested, Antenna Arrays serves as a complete text in phased array design and theory for advanced undergraduate- and graduate-level courses in electronics and communications, as well as a reference for practicing engineers and scientists in wireless communications, radar, and remote sensing.","tags":["Hardware","Wireless Technology"]},{"id":"1587050404","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Signaling System No. 7 (SS7/C7): Protocol, Architecture, and Services","authors":["Lee Dryburgh","Jeff Hewett"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"August 2004","description":"A complete, practical guide to the world's most popular signaling system, including SIGTRAN, GSM-MAP, and Intelligent Networks.\n\nProvides in-depth coverage of the SS7 protocols, including implementation details\n\nCovers SS7 over IP (SIGTRAN) using real-world examples\n\nCovers SS7/C7 from both a North American and European perspective, providing a broad international understanding of the technology and associated standards\n\nExplains mobile wireless concepts and signaling, including mobile application part (MAP)\n\nProvides a thorough explanation of the Intelligent Network (IN) and associated protocols (INAP/AIN)\n\nSignaling System No. 7 (SS7) is a signaling network and protocol that is used globally to bring telecommunications networks, both fixed-line and cellular, to life.

It is one of the most important topics of research in the area of mobile and personal communications. SDR is viewed as the enabler of global roaming and a platform for the introduction of new technologies and services into existing live networks. It therefore gives networks a greater flexibility into mobile communications. It bridges the inter-disciplinary gap in the field as SDR covers two areas of development, namely software development and digital signal processing and the internet. It extends well beyond the simple re-configuration of air interface parameters to cover the whole system from the network to service creation and application development. Reconfigurability entails the pervasive use of software reconfiguration, empowering upgrades or patching of any element of the network and of the services and applications running on it. It cuts across the types of bearer radio systems (Paging to cellular, wireless local area network to microwave, terrestrial to satellite, personal communications to broadcasting) enable the integration of many of today's disparate systems in the same hardware platform. Also it cuts across generation (second to third to fourth). This volume complements the already published volumes 1 and 2 of the Wiley Series in Software Radio.

Chris’s insights shine a light from the internals of WPF to those standing at the entrance, guiding you through the concepts that form the foundation of his creation.” –From the foreword by Chris Sells\n\n“As one of the architects behind WPF, Chris Anderson skillfully explains not only the ‘how,’ but also the ‘why.’ This book is an excellent resource for anyone wanting to understand the design principles and best practices of WPF.” –Anders Hejlsberg, technical fellow, Microsoft Corporation\n\n“If WPF stands as the user interface technology for the next generation of Windows, then Chris Anderson stands as the Charles Petzold for the next generation of Windows user interface developers.” –Ted Neward, founding editor, TheServerSide.NET\n\n“This is an excellent book that does a really great job of introducing you to WPF, and explaining how to unlock the tremendous potential it provides.” –Scott Guthrie, general manager, Developer Division, Microsoft\n\n“WPF is a whole new animal when it comes to creating UI applications, drawing on design principles originating from both Windows Forms and the Web. Chris does a great job of not only explaining how to use the new features and capabilities of WPF (with associated code and XAML based syntax), but also explains why things work the way they do. As one of the architects of WPF, Chris gives great insight into the plumbing and design principles of WPF, as well as the mechanics of writing code using it. This is truly essential if you plan to be a serious WPF developer.” –Brian Noyes, chief architect, IDesign Inc.; Microsoft Regional Director; Microsoft MVP\n\n“I was given the opportunity to take a look at Chris Anderson’s book and found it to be an exceedingly valuable resource, one I can comfortably recommend to others. I can only speak for myself, but when faced with a new technology I like to have an understanding of how it relates to and works in relation to the technology it is supplanting. Chris starts his book by tying the WPF directly into the world of Windows 32-bit UI in C++. Chris demonstrates both a keen understanding of the underlying logic that drives the WPF and how it works and also a skill in helping the reader build on their own knowledge through examples that mimic how you would build your cutting edge applications.” –Bill Sheldon, principal engineer, InterKnowlogy\n\nWindows Presentation Foundation (WPF) replaces Microsoft’s diverse presentation technologies with a unified, state-of-the-art platform for building rich applications. WPF combines the best of Windows and the Web; fully integrates user interfaces, documents, and media; and leverages the full power of XML-based declarative programming.\n\nIn Essential Windows Presentation Foundation, former WPF architect Chris Anderson systematically introduces this breakthrough platform, focusing on the concepts and techniques working developers need in order to build robust applications for real users. Drawing on his unique experience as an architect on the team, Anderson thoroughly illuminates the crucial new concepts underlying WPF and reveals how its APIs work together to offer developers unprecedented value.\n\nThrough working sample code, you’ll discover how WPF draws on the Web’s simple models for markup and deployment, common frame for applications, and rich server connectivity, and on Windows’ rich client model, simple programming model, strong control over look-and-feel, and rich networking.

They offer nearly the same power and flexibility of classic Win32 development, but for a fraction of the effort. The programming model is lean and streamlined, and many of the tedious details that developers used to have to spend time on are now dealt with automatically by the platform. .NET Windows Forms in a Nutshell offers an accelerated introduction to this next-generation of rich user interface development. The book provides an all-inclusive guide for experienced programmers using the .NET Windows Forms platform to develop Windows applications, along with a compact but remarkably complete reference to the .NET Framework Class Library (FCL) Windows Forms namespaces and types. The authors present solid coverage of the fundamental building blocks, such as Controls, Forms, Menus, and GDI+, and enough detail to help you build your own fully featured reusable visual components so you can write visual component libraries as well as standalone applications. .NET Windows Forms in a Nutshell aims to provide not just the practical information and advice required to get programs working, but also to communicate the rationale behind the various parts of Windows Forms' design. The authors show how the thinking behind the framework enhances your productivity substantially. The new framework allows you to guess correctly what \"the Right Way\" to do things is a majority of the time, even if you've never tried what you're doing before. No more digging around in documentation for days to try to find the bit of information you need to use one particular feature. Anyone who is involved in user interface development will appreciate the ease of creation and expanded capabilities provided by .NET Windows Forms, as well as the in-depth focus and straight-forward approach this book brings.

By the time of the second edition, XML had already proven itself to be more than a passing fad, and was in fact being used throughout the industry for an incredibly wide range of uses. With the third edition, it was clear that XML was a mature technology, but more important, it became evident that the XML landscape was dividing into several areas of expertise. Now in this edition, we needed to categorize the increasing number of specifications surrounding XML, which either use XML or provide functionality in addition to the XML core specification.\n\nSo what is XML? It's a markup language, used to describe the structure of data in meaningful ways. Anywhere that data is input/output, stored, or transmitted from one place to another, is a potential fit for XML's capabilities. Perhaps the most well-known applications are web-related (especially with the latest developments in handheld web access—for which some of the technology is XML-based). However, there are many other non-web-based applications for which XML is useful—for example, as a replacement for (or to complement) traditional databases, or for the transfer of financial information between businesses. News organizations, along with individuals, have also been using XML to distribute syndicated news stories and blog entries.\n\nThis book aims to teach you all you need to know about XML—what it is, how it works, what technologies surround it, and how it can best be used in a variety of situations, from simple data transfer to using XML in your web pages. It answers the fundamental questions:\n\nWhat is XML?\n\nHow do you use XML?\n\nHow does it work?\n\n* What can you use it for, anyway?\n\nThis book is for people who know that it would be a pretty good idea to learn XML but aren't 100 percent sure why. You've heard the hype but haven't seen enough substance to figure out what XML is and what it can do. You may be using development tools that try to hide the XML behind user interfaces and scripts, but you want to know what is really happening behind the scenes. You may already be somehow involved in web development and probably even know the basics of HTML, although neither of these qualifications is absolutely necessary for this book.\n\nWhat you don't need is knowledge of markup languages in general. This book assumes that you're new to the concept of markup languages, and we have structured it in a way that should make sense to the beginner and yet quickly bring you to XML expert status.\n\nThe word \"Beginning\" in the title refers to the style of the book, rather than the reader's experience level. There are two types of beginner for whom this book is ideal:\n\nProgrammers who are already familiar with some web programming or data exchange techniques. Programmers in this category will already understand some of the concepts discussed here, but you will learn how you can incorporate XML technologies to enhance those solutions you currently develop.\n\nThose working in a programming environment but with no substantial knowledge or experience of web development or data exchange applications. In addition to learning how XML technologies can be applied to such applications, you will be introduced to some new concepts to help you understand how such systems work.\n\nThe subjects covered in this book are arranged to take you from novice to expert in as logical a manner as we could. This Fourth Edition is structured in sections based on various areas of XML expertise. Unless you are already using XML, you should start by reading the introduction to XML in Part I. From there, you can quickly jump into specific areas of expertise, or, if you prefer, you can read through the book in order. Keep in mind that there is quite a lot of overlap in XML, and that some of the sections make use of techniques described elsewhere in the book.\n\nThe book begins by explaining what exactly XML is and why the industry felt that a language like this was needed.\n\nAfter covering the why, the next logical step is the how, so it shows you how to create well-formed XML.\n\nOnce you understand the whys and hows of XML, you'll go on to some more advanced things you can do when creating your XML documents, to make them not only well formed, but valid. (And you'll learn what \"valid\" really means.)\n\nAfter you're comfortable with XML and have seen it in action, the book unleashes the programmer within and looks at an XML-based programming language that you can use to transform XML documents from one format to another.\n\nEventually, you will need to store and retrieve XML information from databases. At this point, you will learn not only the state of the art for XML and databases, but also how to query XML information using an SQL-like syntax called XQuery.\n\nXML wouldn't really be useful unless you could write programs to read the data in XML documents and create new XML documents, so we'll get back to programming and look at a couple of ways that you can do that.\n\nUnderstanding how to program and use XML within your own business is one thing, but sending that information to a business partner or publishing it to the Internet is another. You'll learn about technologies that use XML that enable you to send messages across the Internet, publish information, and discover services that provide information.\n\nSince you have all of this data in XML format, it would be great if you could easily display it to people, and it turns out you can. You'll see an XML version of HTML called XHTML. You'll also look at a technology you may already be using in conjunction with HTML documents called CSS. CSS enables you to add visual styles to your XML documents. In addition, you'll learn how to design stunning graphics and make interactive forms using XML.\n\nFinally, the book ends with a case study, which should help to give you ideas about how XML can be used in real-life situations, and which could be used in your own applications.\n\nThis book builds on the strengths of the earlier editions, and provides new material to reflect the changes in the XML landscape—notably XQuery, RSS and Atom, and AJAX. Updates have been made to reflect the most recent versions of specifications and best practices throughout the book. In addition to the many changes, each chapter has a set of exercise questions to test your understanding of the material. Possible solutions to these questions appear in Appendix A.\n\nPart I: Introduction: The introduction is where most readers should begin. The first three chapters introduce some of the goals of XML as well as the specific rules for constructing XML. Once you have read this part you should be able to read and create your own XML documents.\n\nChapter 1: What Is XML?: This chapter cover some basic concepts, introducing the fact that XML is a markup language (a bit like HTML) whereby you can define your own elements, tags, and attributes (known as a vocabulary). You'll see that tags have no presentation meaning—they're just a way to describe the structure of the data.\n\nChapter 2: Well-Formed XML: In addition to explaining what well-formed XML is, we offer a look at the rules that exist (the XML 1.0 and 1.1 Recommendations) for naming and structuring elements—you need to comply with these rules in order to produce well-formed XML.\n\nChapter 3: XML Namespaces: Because tags can be made up, you need to avoid name conflicts when sharing documents. Namespaces provide a way to uniquely identify a group of tags, using a URI. This chapter explains how to use namespaces.\n\nPart II: Validation: In addition to the well-formedness rules you learn in Part I, you will most likely want to learn how to create and use different XML vocabularies. This Part introduces you to DTDs, XML Schemas, and RELAX NG: three languages that define custom XML vocabularies. It also shows you how to utilize these definitions to validate your XML documents.\n\nChapter 4: Document Type Definitions: You can specify how an XML document should be structured, and even provide default values, using Document Type Definitions (DTDs). If XML conforms to the associated DTD, it is known as valid XML. This chapter covers the basics of using DTDs.\n\nChapter 5: XML Schemas: XML Schemas, like DTDs, enable you to define how a document should be structured. In addition to defining document structure, they enable you to specify the individual datatypes of attribute values and element content. They are a more powerful alternative to DTDs.\n\nChapter 6: RELAX NG: RELAX NG is a third technology used to define the structure of documents. In addition to a new syntax and new features, it takes the best from XML Schemas and DTDs, and is therefore very simple and very powerful. RELAX NG has two syntaxes; both the full syntax and compact syntax are discussed.\n\nPart III: Processing: In addition to defining and creating XML documents, you need to know how to work with documents to extract information and convert it to other formats. In fact, easily extracting information and converting it to other formats is what makes XML so powerful.\n\nChapter 7: XPath: The XPath language is used to locate sections and data in the XML document, and it's important in many other XML technologies.\n\nChapter 8: XSLT: XML can be transformed into other XML documents, HTML, and other formats using XSLT stylesheets, which are introduced in this chapter.\n\nPart IV: Databases: Creating and processing XML documents is good, but eventually you will want to store those documents. This section describes strategies for storing and retrieving XML documents and document fragments from different databases.\n\nChapter 9: XQuery, the XML Query Language: Very often, you will need to retrieve information from within a database. XQuery, which is built on XPath and XPath2, enables you to do this in an elegant way.\n\nChapter 10: XML and Databases: XML is perfect for structuring data, and some traditional databases are beginning to offer support for XML. This chapter discusses these, and provides a general overview of how XML can be used in an n-tier architecture. In addition, new databases based on XML are introduced.\n\nPart V: Programming: At some point in your XML career, you will need to work with an XML document from within a custom application. The two most popular methodologies, the Document Object Model (DOM) and the Simple API for XML (SAX), are explained in this part.\n\nChapter 11: The Document Object Model (DOM): Programmers can use a variety of programming languages to manipulate XML using the Document Object Model's objects, interfaces, methods, and properties, which are described in this chapter.\n\nChapter 12: Simple API for XML (SAX): An alternative to the DOM for programmatically manipulating XML data is to use the Simple API for XML (SAX) as an interface. This chapter shows how to use SAX and utilizes examples from the Java SAX API.\n\nPart VI: Communication: Sending and receiving data from one computer to another is often difficult, but several technologies have been created to make communication with XML much easier. This part discusses RSS and content syndication, as well as web services and SOAP. This edition includes a new chapter on Ajax techniques.\n\nChapter 13: RSS, Atom, and Content Syndication: RSS is an actively evolving technology that is used to publish syndicated news stories and website summaries on the Internet. This chapter not only discusses how to use the different versions of RSS and Atom, it also covers the future direction of the technology. In addition, it demonstrates how to create a simple newsreader application that works with any of the currently published versions.\n\nChapter 14: Web Services: Web services enable you to perform cross-computer communications. This chapter describes web services and introduces you to using remote procedure calls in XML (using XML-RPC and REST), as well as giving you a brief look at major topics such as SOAP. Finally, it breaks down the assortment of specifications designed to work in conjunction with web services.\n\nChapter 15: SOAP and WSDL: Fundamental to XML web services, the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) is one of the most popular specifications for allowing cross-computer communications. Using SOAP, you can package up XML documents and send them across the Internet to be processed. This chapter explains SOAP and the Web Services Description Language (WSDL) that is used to publish your service.\n\nChapter 16: Ajax: Ajax enables you to utilize JavaScript with web services and SOAP, or REST communications. Additionally, Ajax patterns can be used within web pages to communicate with the web server without refreshing. This chapter is new to the Fourth Edition.\n\nPart VII: Display: Several XML technologies are devoted to displaying the data stored inside of an XML document. Some of these technologies are web-based, and some are designed for applications and mobile devices. This part discusses the primary display strategies and formats used today.\n\nChapter 17: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS): Website designers have long been using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) with their HTML to easily make changes to a website's presentation without having to touch the underlying HTML documents. This power is also available for XML, enabling you to display XML documents right in the browser. Or, if you need a bit more flexibility with your presentation, you can use XSLT to transform your XML to HTML or XHTML and then use CSS to style these documents.\n\nChapter 18: XHTML: XHTML is a new version of HTML that follows the rules of XML. This chapter discusses the differences between HTML and XHTML, and shows you how XHTML can help make your sites available to a wider variety of browsers, from legacy browsers to the latest browsers on mobile phones.\n\nChapter 19: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG): Do you want to produce a custom graphic using XML? SVG enables you to describe a graphic using XML-based vector commands. This chapter teaches you the basics of SVG and then dives into a more complex SVG-based application that can be published to the Internet.\n\nChapter 20: XForms: XForms are XML-based forms that can be used to design desktop applications, paper-based forms, and of course XHTML-based forms. This chapter demonstrates both the basics and some of the more interesting uses of XForms.\n\nPart VIII: Case Study: Throughout the book you'll gain an understanding of how XML is used in web, business-to-business (B2B), data storage, and many other applications. The case study covers an example application and shows how the theory can be put into practice in real-life situations. The case study is new to this edition.\n\nChapter 21: Case Study: Payment Calculator: This case study explores some of the possibilities and strategies for using XML in your website.

As a matter of fact, it's been reported that the number of blogs during that time has grown from 100,000 to 4.8 million-with no end to this growth in sight.What's the technology that makes blogging tick? The answer is RSS--a format that allows bloggers to offer XML-based feeds of their content. It's also the same technology that's incorporated into the websites of media outlets so they can offer material (headlines, links, articles, etc.) syndicated by other sites.As the main technology behind this rapidly growing field of content syndication, RSS is constantly evolving to keep pace with worldwide demand. That's where Developing Feeds with RSS and Atom steps in. It provides bloggers, web developers, and programmers with a thorough explanation of syndication in general and the most popular technologies used to develop feeds.This book not only highlights all the new features of RSS 2.0-the most recent RSS specification-but also offers complete coverage of its close second in the XML-feed arena, Atom. The book has been exhaustively revised to explain:\n\nmetadata interpretation\nthe different forms of content syndication\nthe increasing use of web services\nhow to use popular RSS news aggregators on the market\nAfter an introduction that examines Internet content syndication in general (its purpose, limitations, and traditions), this step-by-step guide tackles various RSS and Atom vocabularies, as well as techniques for applying syndication to problems beyond news feeds. Most importantly, it gives you a firm handle on how to create your own feeds, and consume or combine other feeds.If you're interested in producing your own content feed, Developing Feeds with RSS and Atom is the one book you'll want in hand.","tags":["Data","Data Engineering","Storage Formats","XML"]},{"id":"9780750652148","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Radio and Electronics Cookbook","authors":["RSGB"],"pages":"336","publication_date":"November 2000","description":"Radio and Electronics Cookbook is a unique collection of electronics projects, ideal for all electronics enthusiasts and experimenters.

It is one of the most important topics of research in the area of mobile and personal communications. SDR is viewed as the enabler of global roaming and a platform for the introduction of new technologies and services into existing live networks. It therefore gives networks a greater flexibility into mobile communications. It bridges the inter-disciplinary gap in the field as SDR covers two areas of development, namely software development and digital signal processing and the internet. It extends well beyond the simple re-configuration of air interface parameters to cover the whole system from the network to service creation and application development. Reconfigurability entails the pervasive use of software reconfiguration, empowering upgrades or patching of any element of the network and of the services and applications running on it. It cuts across the types of bearer radio systems (Paging to cellular, wireless local area network to microwave, terrestrial to satellite, personal communications to broadcasting) enable the integration of many of today's disparate systems in the same hardware platform. Also it cuts across generation (second to third to fourth). This volume complements the already published volumes 1 and 2 of the Wiley Series in Software Radio. The book discusses the requirements for reconfigurability and then introduces network architectures and functions for reconfigurable terminals. Finally it deals with reconfiguration in the network. The book also provides a comprehensive view on reconfigurability in three very active research projects as CAST, MOBIVAS and TRUST/SCOUT.\n\nKey features include:\n\nPresents new research in wireless communications\n\nSummarises the results of an extensive research program on software defined radios in Europe\n\nProvides a comprehensive view on reconfigurability in three very active research projects as CAST (Configurable radio with Advanced Sodftware Technology), MOBIVAS (Downloadable MOBIle Value Added Services through Software Radio and Switching Integrated Platforms), TRUST (Transparently Re-configurable Ubiquitous Terminal) and SCOUT (Smart User-Centric Communciation Environment).","tags":["Hardware","Wireless Technology","Telecommunications","Radio"]},{"id":"0131851373","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"RFID Sourcebook","authors":["Sandip Lahiri"],"pages":"304","publication_date":"August 2005","description":"The realistic, no-hype guide to RFID evaluation, planning, and deployment\n\nApproaching crucial decisions about Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology?

Or have you ever wanted to publish information on the Web so that programs other than browsers could work with it? XML-RPC, a system for remote procedure calls built on XML and the ubiquitous HTTP protocol, is the solution you've been looking for.Programming Web Services with XML-RPC introduces the simple but powerful capabilities of XML-RPC, which lets you connect programs running on different computers with a minimum of fuss, by wrapping procedure calls in XML and establishing simple pathways for calling functions. With XML-RPC, Java programs can talk to Perl scripts, which can talk to Python programs, ASP applications, and so on. You can provide access to procedure calls without having to worry about the system on the other end, so it's easy to create services that are available on the Web.XML-RPC isn't the only solution for web services; the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) is another much-hyped protocol for implementing web services. While XML-RPC provides fewer capabilities than SOAP, it also has far fewer interoperability problems and its capabilities and limitations are much better understood. XML-RPC is also stable, with over 30 implementations on a wide variety of platforms, so you can start doing real work with it immediately.Programming Web Services with XML-RPC covers the details of five XML-RPC implementations, so you can get started developing distributed applications in Java, Perl, Python, ASP, or PHP. The chapters on these implementations contain code examples that you can use as the basis for your own work. This book also provides in-depth coverage of the XML-RPC specification, which is helpful for low-level debugging of XML-RPC clients and servers.

It also gets into significant detail about when data binding is appropriate to use, and provides numerous practical examples of using data binding in applications.\n\nAs Author Brett McLaughlin says \"Too many books are written about technologies by people who barely understand them. I've already written two data binding implementations (Zeus, and a previous one for IBM DeveloperWorks.) I've actually used data binding for longer than the official specification has been in existence, and I've really been able to dig into what it takes to code an effective data biding implementation, as well as use one correctly. This book is part user guide, part under-the-hood manual, and part use-case. It's a powerful combination, and one I think people need.\"","tags":["Data","Data Engineering","Storage Formats","XML"]},{"id":"0768668425","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Performing an Active Directory Health Check","authors":["Andrew Abbate"],"pages":"104","publication_date":"August 2006","description":"Organizations that have implemented Microsoft® Windows Active Directory® need to make sure that Active Directory is configured and operating properly.

Gender discrimination takes center stage in discussions of internal pay equity, but many other protected characteristics may be invoked as grounds for alleging discrimination: age, race, disability, physical appearance, and more. This broad range of vulnerability to discrimination charges is often neglected in corporate assessments of how well compensation systems comply with the law and satisfy employee norms of fairness. Blind spots in general equity constitute a serious threat to organizational performance and risk management. In Compensating Your Employees Fairly, a respected practitioner and consultant lays out in practical terms everything you need to know to protect your company along the full spectrum of internal pay equity issues, including all the technical methods you need to optimize compliance and minimize risk.\n\nCompensating Your Employees Fairly is a timely survey and comprehensive handbook for compensation specialists, HR professionals, EEO compliance officers, and in-house counsel. It provides all the information you need to ensure that compensation systems are equitable, auditable, internally consistent, and externally compliant with equal employment opportunity laws and regulations. The author presents technical information—both legal and statistical—in common-sense terms. Her non-technical breakdown of complex statistical concepts distills just as much as practitioners need to know in order to effectively deploy and interpret the standard applications of statistical analysis to internal pay equity. The focus throughout the book is on real-world application, current examples, and up-to-the-minute information on recent and pending wrinkles in the evolving legal landscape.\n\nReaders of Compensating Your Employees Fairly will learn:\n\nWhy internal equity in compensation matters\n\nHow to detect intentional and non-intentional discrimination in compensation\n\nThe basics of statistical inference and multiple regression analysis\n\nThe essentials of data availability, measurability, and collection\n\nThe criteria for assessing compensation systems for internal equity\n\nHow to investigate potential problems and react to formal complaints and actions\n\nHow to avoid litigation and put in place ongoing measures for proactive self-auditing\n\nWhat you'll learn\n\nReaders of Compensating Your Employees Fairly will learn:\n\nWhy internal equity in compensation matters\n\nHow to detect intentional and non-intentional discrimination in compensation\n\nHow to investigate potential problems and react to formal complaints and actions\n\nHow to avoid litigation and put in place ongoing measures for proactive self-auditing\n\nWho this book is for\n\nHR professionals, compensation specialists, EEO compliance officers, in-house counsel, and employment attorneys will find invaluable the expert author's non-technical treatment of the technical issues that are essential to understanding all facets of internal pay equity.

A lot of organizations are not only attracted to VoIP's promise of cost savings, but its ability to move data, images, and voice traffic over the same connection. Think of it: a single Internet phone call can take information sharing to a whole new level.\n\nThat's why many IT administrators and developers are actively looking to set up VoIP-based private telephone switching systems within the enterprise. The efficiency that network users can reach with it is almost mind-boggling. And cheap, if the system is built with open source software like Asterisk. There are commercial VoIP options out there, but many are expensive systems running old, complicated code on obsolete hardware. Asterisk runs on Linux and can interoperate with almost all standards-based telephony equipment. And you can program it to your liking.\n\nAsterisk's flexibility comes at a price, however: it's not a simple system to learn, and the documentation is lacking. Asterisk: The Future of Telephony solves that problem by offering a complete roadmap for installing, configuring, and integrating Asterisk with existing phone systems. Our guide walks you through a basic dial plan step by step, and gives you enough working knowledge to set up a simple but complete system.\n\nWhat you end up with is largely up to you. Asterisk embraces the concept of standards-compliance, but also gives you freedom to choose how to implement your system. Asterisk: The Future of Telephony outlines all the options, and shows you how to set up voicemail services, call conferencing, interactive voice response, call waiting, caller ID, and more. You'll also learn how Asterisk merges voice and data traffic seamlessly across disparate networks. And you won't need additional hardware. For interconnection with digital and analog telephone equipment, Asterisk supports a number of hardware devices.\n\nReady for the future of telephony? We'll help you hook it up.","tags":["Hardware","Wireless Technology","Telecommunications","VoIP","Asterisk"]},{"id":"9780768686005","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"MCTS 70-640 Exam Cram: Windows Server 2008 Active Directory, Configuring","authors":["Don Poulton"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"September 2008","description":"MCTS Exam Cram\n\nWindows Server 2008 Active Directory, Configuring\n\nExam 70-640\n\nDon Poulton\n\nCovers the critical information you’ll need to know to score higher on Exam 70-640!\n\nUtilize new features of Windows Server 2008 related to Active Directory\n\nInstall and configure Active Directory forests and domains\n\nPlan and implement an Organizational Unit structure\n\nPlan and manage Active Directory infrastructure components, such as operations masters, global catalogs, read-only domain controllers, and sites\n\nPlan, implement, and manage Active Directory using Group Policy\n\nPlan and manage Active Directory roles, including Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services, Active Directory Rights Management Services, and Active Directory Federation Services\n\nDeploy software in Active Directory using Group Policy\n\nUtilize Active Directory features to manage users and groups\n\nBack up and restore Active Directory, and rebuild an Active Directory domain controller from backup\n\nDeploy and manage a public key infrastructure using Active Directory Certificate Services\n\nCD Features MeasureUp Practice Questions!\n\nDetailed explanations of correct and incorrect answers\n\nMultiple test modes\n\nRandom questions and order of answers\n\nCoverage of each 70-640 exam objective\n\nWRITTEN BY A LEADING EXPERT:\n\nDon Poulton, MCSA, MCSE, A+, Network+, Security+, has been involved in consulting with small training providers as a technical writer, during which time he wrote training and exam prep materials for Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000, and Windows XP.

Written by an author team of veteran programmers and developers, Professional Visual Studio 2010 gets you quickly up to speed on what you can expect from the newest version of Visual Studio.\n\nThis book's first section is dedicated to familiarizing you with the core aspects of Visual Studio 2010. Everything you need is contained in the first five chapters, from the IDE structure and layout to the various options and settings you can change to make the user interface synchronize with your own way of doing things.\n\nFrom there, the remainder of the book is broken into 11 parts:\n\nGetting Started: In this part, you learn how to take control of your projects and organize them in ways that work with your own style.\n\nDigging Deeper: Though the many graphical components of Visual Studio that make a programmer's job easier are discussed in many places throughout this book, you often need help when you're in the process of actually writing code. This part deals with features that support the coding of applications such as IntelliSense, code refactoring, and creating and running unit tests In the latest version of the .NET framework, enhancements were added to support dynamic languages and move towards feature parity between the two primary .NET languages, C# and VB. This part covers changes to these languages, as well as looking at a range of features that will help you write better and more consistent code.\n\nRich Client and Web Applications: For support building everything from Office add-ins to cloud applications, Visual Studio enables you to develop applications for a wide range of platforms. These two parts cover the application platforms that are supported within Visual Studio 2010, including ASP.NET and Office, WPF, Silverlight 2 and ASP.NET MVC.\n\nData: A large proportion of applications use some form of data storage. Visual Studio 2010 and the .NET Framework include strong support for working with databases and other data sources. This part examines how to use DataSets, the Visual Database Tools, LINQ, Synchronization Services and ADO.NET Entity Framework to build applications that work with data. It also shows you how you can then present this data using Reporting.\n\nApplication Services: Through the course of building an application you are likely to require access to services that may or may not reside within your organization. This part covers core technologies such as WCF, WF, Synchronization Services and WCF RIA services that you can use to connect to these services.\n\nConfiguration and Internationalization: The built-in support for configuration files allows you to adjust the way an application functions on the fly without having to rebuild it. Furthermore, resource files can be used to both access static data and easily localize an application into foreign languages and cultures. This part of the book shows how to use .NET configuration and resource files.\n\nDebugging: Application debugging is one of the more challenging tasks developers have to tackle, but correct use of the Visual Studio 2010 debugging features will help you analyze the state of the application and determine the cause of any bugs. This part examines the rich debugging support provided by the IDE.\n\nBuild and Deployment: In addition to discussing how to build your solutions effectively and getting applications into the hands of your end users, this part also deals with the process of upgrading your projects from previous versions.\n\nCustomizing and Extending Visual Studio: If the functionality found in the previous part isn't enough to help you in your coding efforts, Microsoft has made Visual Studio 2010 even more extensible. This part covers the automation model, how to write add-ins and macros, and then how to use a new extensibility framework, MEF, to extend Visual Studio 2010.\n\nVisual Studio Ultimate: The final part of the book examines the additional features only available in the Premium and Ultimate versions of Visual Studio 2010. In addition, you'll also learn how the Team Foundation Server provides an essential tool for managing software projects.\n\nThough this breakdown of the Visual Studio feature set provides the most logical and easily understood set of topics, you may need to look for specific functions that will aid you in a particular activity. To address this need, references to appropriate chapters are provided whenever a feature is covered in more detail elsewhere in the book.\n\nProfessional Visual Studio 2010 is for all developers new to Visual Studio as well as those programmers who have some experience but want to learn about features they may have previously overlooked.\n\nIf you are familiar with the way previous versions of Visual Studio worked, you may want to skim over Part I, which deals with the basic constructs that make up the user interface, and move on to the remainder of the book where the new features found in Visual Studio 2010 are discussed in detail. While you may be familiar with most of Part I, it is worth reading this section in case there are features of Visual Studio 2010 that you haven't seen or used before.\n\nIf you're just starting out, you'll greatly benefit from the first part, where basic concepts are explained and you're introduced to the user interface and how to customize it to suit your own style.","tags":["Software Development","Programming Languages",".NET","Windows Forms"]},{"id":"9780470011430","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Mobile Messaging Technologies and Services: SMS, EMS and MMS, 2nd Edition","authors":["Gwenaël Le Bodic"],"pages":"452","publication_date":"March 2005","description":"Building on the success of the first edition, Mobile Messaging Technologies and Services offers extensive new and revised material based upon the latest research and industry developments.

RFID tags can be small adhesive stickers containing antennas that receive and respond to transmissions from RFID transmitters. RFID tags are used to identify and track everything from food, dogs, beer kegs to library books. RFID tags use a standard that has already been hacked by several researchers. RFID Security discusses the motives for someone wanting to hack an RFID system and shows how to protect systems. Coverage includes: security breaches for monetary gain (hacking a shops RFID system would allow a hacker to lower the pricing on any product products). How to protect the supply chain (malicous/mischievous hackers can delete/alter/modify all identifying information for an entire shipment of products). How to protect personal privacy (privacy advocates fear that RFID tags embedded in products, which continue to transmit information after leaving a store, will be used to track consumer habits).The purpose of an RFID system is to enable data to be transmitted by a portable device, called a tag, which is read by an RFID reader and processed according to the needs of a particular application. The data transmitted by the tag may provide identification or location information, or specifics about the product tagged, such as price, colour, date of purchase, etc. .* Deloitte & Touche expects over 10 billion RFID tags to be in circulation by the end of 2005 * Parties debating the security issue of RFID need information on the pros and cons of the technology and this is that information* Little competition in a market desperate for information","tags":["Hardware","Wireless Technology","Radio-frequency identification (RFID)"]},{"id":"9780768683820","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Wi-Fi Experience: Everyone’s Guide to 802.11b Wireless Networking","authors":["Harold Davis","Richard Mansfield"],"pages":"176","publication_date":"December 2001","description":"This book is a complete \"experience\" for Wi-Fi users, offering how-to instructions and software discounts, full versions on the CD, and recommendations for Wi-Fi projects.

Two modes for 802.11i for two different groups of devices is suggested and evaluated with the current encryption method for AES-CCMP to compare the performance.\n\nAlmost every organization in today's world relies on wireless networks to transmit information, and much of that information should be kept secure. Banking, healthcare, and the military are all vital industries that rely on wireless security for a huge section of their operations. Security experts of today and tomorrow will learn a lot from Optimizing IEE 802.11i Resources and Security Essentials, and it can be used for master level in computer science, information security, wireless network security and cryptography.\n\nThe research in this book covers how to best balance security concerns with limited resources available on wireless devices as well as how to optimize security resources on higher-end non-mobile devices","tags":["IT Operations","Computer Networking","Wireless Networks","802.11"]},{"id":"9781491999219","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Programming iOS 11","authors":["Matt Neuburg"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"December 2017","description":"If you’re grounded in the basics of Swift, Xcode, and the Cocoa framework, this book provides a structured explanation of all essential real-world iOS app components.

The 802.11b standard (also known as WiFi) makes it possible to network towns, schools, neighborhoods, small business, and almost any kind of organization. All that's required is a willingness to cooperate and share resources. The first edition of this book helped thousands of people engage in community networking activities. At the time, it was impossible to predict how quickly and thoroughly WiFi would penetrate the marketplace. Today, with WiFi-enabled computers almost as common as Ethernet, it makes even more sense to take the next step and network your community using nothing but freely available radio spectrum. This book has showed many people how to make their network available, even from the park bench, how to extend high-speed Internet access into the many areas not served by DSL and cable providers, and how to build working communities and a shared though intangible network. All that's required to create an access point for high-speed Internet connection is a gateway or base station. Once that is set up, any computer with a wireless card can log onto the network and share its resources. Rob Flickenger built such a network in northern California, and continues to participate in network-building efforts. His nuts-and-bolts guide covers:\n\nSelecting the appropriate equipment\n\nFinding antenna sites, and building and installing antennas\n\nProtecting your network from inappropriate access\n\nNew network monitoring tools and techniques (new)\n\nRegulations affecting wireless deployment (new)\n\nIP network administration, including DNS and IP Tunneling (new)\n\nHis expertise, as well as his sense of humor and enthusiasm for the topic, makes Building Wireless Community Networks a very useful and readable book for anyone interested in wireless connectivity.","tags":["IT Operations","Computer Networking","Wireless Networks"]},{"id":"9780123846983","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Game Theory and Learning for Wireless Networks","authors":["Samson Lasaulce","Hamidou Tembine"],"pages":"336","publication_date":"September 2011","description":"Written by leading experts in the field, Game Theory and Learning for Wireless Networks Covers how theory can be used to solve prevalent problems in wireless networks such as power control, resource allocation or medium access control.

Over the last couple of years, XML has become the de facto standard to exchange information between organizations, as well as between departments or applications within the same organization. Since data tends to live in databases, it needs to be converted from a relational format into an XML format when involved in those data exchanges, as well as converted (back) from XML into a relational format for storage, or for handling by other applications.\n\nHow can we achieve this? This IBM Redbooks publication describes how to design the mapping between XML and relational data, and vice versa, to enable a flexible exchange of information.\n\nIBM provides a number of products to help you bridge the gap between XML and its relational database, DB2. The DB2 engine itself provides support to generate XML fragments from relational data through the use of SQL/XML built-in functions. DB2 also provides the DB2 XML Extender. It allows you to perform XML composition, like SQL/XML, but also provides functionality to decompose XML documents and store XML documents intact inside the database. XML Extender also provides a set of transformation and validation functions. Another option to work with XML is to use the XML wrapper, a part of the set of non-relational wrappers of DB2 Information Integrator. This book also looks at the IBM tools available to assist you when dealing with XML, specifically WebSphere Application Developer and DB2 Control Center. To add a more practical angle, these functions and products are illustrated through the development of a simple application.\n\nPlease note that the additional material referenced in the text is not available from IBM.","tags":["Data","Data Engineering","Storage Formats","XML"]},{"id":"53863MIT59232","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Trouble with Homogeneous Teams","authors":["Martha E. Mangelsdorf"],"pages":"5","publication_date":"January 2018","description":"Many companies are paying increased attention to workplace diversity — issues such as how to increasediversity, how to foster sensitivity to it, and how to manage a diverse workforce. But, according to MITSloan School of Management professor Evan Apfelbaum, managers should also factor in issues associatedwith a related problem: workplace homogeneity. In this interview with MIT Sloan Management Revieweditorial director Martha E. Mangelsdorf, Apfelbaum explains why diverse groups are sometimes able toreach better decisions than homogenous groups. Recent research, including Apfelbaum's own, has found,for example, that racially homogeneous groups are less rigorous in their decision-making — and makemore mistakes — than groups composed of people with racially diverse backgrounds.For example, Apfelbaum notes that in a study that compared trading practices of homogeneous anddiverse groups in both Asia and the U.S., members of the racially homogeneous groups showed a greaterwillingness to pay more than things were worth. What's more, people within such groups were \"more likelyto copy another person's mistake — presumably assuming that the mistake had some value that they justdidn't understand.\" According to Apfelbaum, this finding suggests \"that there is something fundamentalabout working with similar versus different others that affects individuals' decision-making.\" Other studieshave similarly indicated that diverse groups have fewer blind spots. In diverse groups, Apfelbaum says,people are more likely to \"come to an independent assessment of what they think to be the case.\"In the interview, Apfelbaum observes that \"diversity can be both advantageous and complicated inthe workplace and in decision-making groups.\" Many people in social settings gravitate toward peoplewith similar backgrounds, and research has also shown that diverse groups can experience conflict andmistrust. However, conflict isn't necessarily a negative. In one study, for example, different groups wereasked to review identical information before reaching their recommendations. The diverse groupstended to consider more perspectives than the homogeneous ones and were more accurate in both theirdecisions and their assessments of their performance. The homogeneous groups had more confidencein their decisions, but those decisions were actually less accurate.","tags":["Business","Human Resources","Workforce Diversity"]},{"id":"9781523087075","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Subtle Acts of Exclusion","authors":["Tiffany Jana","Michael Baran"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"March 2020","description":"This practical, accessible, nonjudgmental handbook is the first to help individuals and organizations recognize and prevent microaggressions so that all employees can feel a sense of belonging in their workplace. Our workplaces and society are growing more diverse, but are we supporting inclusive cultures? While overt racism, sexism, ableism, and other forms of discrimination are relatively easy to spot, we cannot neglect the subtler everyday actions that normalize exclusion. Many have heard the term microaggression, but not everyone fully understands what they are or how to recognize them and stop them from happening. In this book, Tiffany Jana and Michael Baran offer a clearer, more accessible term, subtle acts of exclusion, or SAEs, to emphasize the purpose and effects of these actions. After all, people generally aren't trying to be aggressive—usually they're trying to say something nice, learn more about a person, be funny, or build closeness. But whether in the form of exaggerated stereotypes, backhanded compliments, unfounded assumptions, or objectification, SAE are damaging to our coworkers, friends, and acquaintances. Jana and Baran give simple and clear tools to identify and address such acts, offering scripts and action plans for everybody involved: the subject, initiator, and observer. Knowing how to have these conversations in an open-minded, honest way will help us build trust and create stronger workplaces and healthier, happier people and communities.","tags":["Business","Human Resources","Workforce Diversity"]},{"id":"9780470477250","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Beginning XSLT and XPath: Transforming XML Documents and Data","authors":["Ian Williams"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"September 2009","description":"Provides the basic education in the XSLT processing model that developers have requested\n\nThe growth of XML content management applications is boosting the demand for XSLT and XPath skills.

RFID tags can be small adhesive stickers containing antennas that receive and respond to transmissions from RFID transmitters. RFID tags are used to identify and track everything from Exxon EZ pass to dogs to beer kegs to library books. Major companies and countries around the world are adopting or considering whether to adopt RFID technologies. Visa and Wells Fargo are currently running tests with RFID, airports around the world are using RFID to track cargo and run customs departments, universities such as Slippery Rock are providing RFID-enabled cell phones for students to use for campus charges. According to the July 9 CNET article, RFID Tags: Big Brother in Small Packages?, \"You should become familiar with RFID technology because you'll be hearing much more about it soon. Retailers adore the concept, and CNET News.com's own Alorie Gilbert wrote last week about how Wal-Mart and the U.K.-based grocery chain Tesco are starting to install \"smart shelves\" with networked RFID readers.

La'Wana Harris's Inclusion Coaching method helps people realize that sharing power isn't the same as losing it. The elephant in the room with diversity work is that people with privilege must use it to allow others equal access to power. This is often why diversity efforts falter—people believe in diversity until they feel that they have to give something up. How do we talk them through this shift?La'Wana Harris introduces Inclusion Coaching, a new tool based on cutting-edge research that identifies the stages of preparation, implementation, and “self-work” necessary to help individuals, teams, and organizations build a sustainable culture of inclusion. Harris's six-stage COMMIT model—Commit to courageous action, Open your eyes and ears, Move beyond lip service, Make room for controversy and conflict, Invite new perspectives, and Tell the truth even when it hurts—provides a proven process for making people aware of their own conscious and unconscious biases and concrete steps to make inclusion an embedded reality. Harris offers managers and diversity coaches new models to empower everyone from employees to CEOs to “do” inclusion and address deep-rooted biases that are often invisible. She addresses the growing need to challenge bias and build authentic cultures where everyone can feel a sense of belonging.","tags":["Business","Human Resources","Workforce Diversity"]},{"id":"9780123983312","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Audio Production Worktext, 7th Edition","authors":["Sam Sauls","Craig Stark"],"pages":"273","publication_date":"May 2013","description":"Providing insight into the impact media convergence has had on the radio industry, this new edition delivers an excellent introduction to the modern radio production studio, the equipment found in that studio, and the basic techniques needed to accomplish radio production work.\n\nNew chapters addressing the basics of field recording, production planning, and sound for video are included, as well as a renewed emphasis on not just radio production, but audio production.\n\nFeaturing a worktext format tailored for both students and teachers, self-study questions, hands-on projects, and a CD with project material, quizzes, and demonstrations of key concepts, this book offers a solid foundation for anyone who wishes to know more about radio/audio equipment and production techniques.","tags":["Hardware","Wireless Technology","Telecommunications","Radio"]},{"id":"1587201623","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Internet Phone Services Simplified","authors":["Jim Doherty","Neil Anderson"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"April 2006","description":"Internet Phone Services Simplified gives you the most basic need-to-know information and then teaches you how to get the most out of your VoIP phone services:\n\nUnderstand how broadband VoIP, Internet VoIP, and VoIP Chat services work\n\nLearn about and compare different services, their advantages, and their limitations\n\nSubscribe to a service, install equipment, and troubleshoot issues that might arise\n\nIntegrate services into your home, including reusing your existing house telephone wiring and phone handsets\n\nExtend VoIP throughout your home by using multiline, extendable cordless phone systems\n\nTake advantage of VoIP features, including virtual phone numbers and listening to voicemail using your computer while traveling\n\nInternet phone services offer great advantages over existing telephone systems, allowing you to save money and make and receive calls using high-speed and broadband services.

Athena Rising is a book for men about how to eliminate this problem by mentoring women deliberately and effectively.\n\nTraditional notions of mentoring are modeled on male-to-male relationships, yet women often report a desire for mentoring that addresses their interpersonal needs.

However, to fully achieve this lofty status, system administrators and security professionals must install, configure, monitor, log, and troubleshoot a dizzying array of new features and tools designed to keep the bad guys out and maintain the integrity of their network servers. This is no small task considering the market saturation of Windows Server and the rate at which it is attacked by malicious hackers. According to IDC, Windows Server runs 38% of all network servers. This market prominence also places Windows Server at the top of the SANS top 20 Security Attach Targets. The first five attack targets listed in the SANS top 20 for operating systems are related to Windows Server. This doesn't mean that Windows is inherently less secure than other operating systems; it's simply a numbers game. More machines running Windows Server. More targets for attackers to hack.As a result of being at the top of the \"most used\" and \"most hacked\" lists, Microsoft has released a truly powerful suite of security tools for system administrators to deploy with Windows Server 2008. This book is the comprehensive guide needed by system administrators and security professionals to master seemingly overwhelming arsenal of new security tools including: 1. Network Access Protection, which gives administrators the power to isolate computers that don't comply with established security policies. The ability to enforce security requirements is a powerful means of protecting the network.2. Enhanced solutions for intelligent rules and policies creation to increase control and protection over networking functions, allowing administrators to have a policy-driven network.3. Protection of data to ensure it can only be accessed by users with the correct security context, and to make it available when hardware failures occur.4. Protection against malicious software with User Account Control with a new authentication architecture.5.

IBM z® Systems, the latest generation of the IBM distinguished family of mainframe systems, has come a long way from its IBM System/360 heritage. Likewise, its IBM z/OS® operating system is far superior to its predecessors in providing, among many other capabilities, world-class and state-of-the-art support for the TCP/IP Internet protocol suite.\n\nTCP/IP is a large and evolving collection of communication protocols managed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), an open, volunteer organization. Because of its openness, the TCP/IP protocol suite has become the foundation for the set of technologies that form the basis of the Internet. The convergence of IBM mainframe capabilities with Internet technology, connectivity, and standards (particularly TCP/IP) is dramatically changing the face of information technology and driving requirements for ever more secure, scalable, and highly available mainframe TCP/IP implementations.\n\nThe IBM z/OS Communications Server TCP/IP Implementation series provides understandable, step-by-step guidance about how to enable the most commonly used and important functions of z/OS Communications Server TCP/IP.\n\nThis IBM Redbooks® publication is for people who install and support z/OS Communications Server. It explains how to set up security for your z/OS networking environment. With the advent of TCP/IP and the Internet, network security requirements have become more stringent and complex. Because many transactions are from unknown users and untrusted networks such as the Internet, careful attention must be given to host and user authentication, data privacy, data origin authentication, and data integrity. Also, because security technologies are complex and can be confusing, we include helpful tutorial information in the appendixes of this book.\n\nFor more information about z/OS Communications Server base functions, standard applications, and high availability, see the other following volumes in the series:\n\n, SG24-8360\n\nIBM z/OS V2R2 Communications Server TCP/IP Implementation Volume 1: Base Functions, Connectivity, and Routing\n\n, SG24-8361\n\nIBM z/OS V2R2 Communications Server TCP/IP Implementation Volume 2: Standard Applications\n\n, SG24-8362\n\nIBM z/OS V2R2 Communications Server TCP/IP Implementation Volume 3: High Availability, Scalability, and Performance\n\nThis book does not duplicate the information in these publications. Instead, it complements those publications with practical implementation scenarios that might be useful in your environment.

But until now, the field of diversity had no established standard for evaluating best practices, or even agreement on fundamental philosophies, principles, and concepts. In this pioneering book, the world's leading diversity authority proposes a framework that will facilitate the development of a truly world-class standard for diversity management.R. Roosevelt Thomas begins by laying out his Four Quadrant model, which encompasses all core diversity strategies: managing workforce demographic representation, managing demographic relationships, managing diverse talent, and managing all strategic diversity mixtures. He analyzes the goals, motives, approaches, accomplishments, and challenges associated with each quadrant, as well as the paradigm or mindset that lies behind each quadrant's express purpose. Having laid out this broad range of strategies, Thomas shows how to realize them through the Strategic Diversity Management Process™, by far the most effective method for implementation. A detailed case study of CEO Jeff Kilt—a fictional composite of the many executives Thomas has worked with—effectively illustrates the complexities encountered when working with each of the Four Quadrant strategies in the real world. This book offers a comprehensive blueprint that will enable leaders to address any diversity issue (not just race or gender) in any setting, anywhere in the world.

It is rigorous, deeply personal, experience based, and, if done well, life changing. Rodgers and Kangas offer a complete guide, from design to implementation to results. They show how to• determine what specific, tangible outcomes an organization wants before it starts• link diversity training to overall organizational strategy• help all participants forge an individual, emotional connection to the training• identify what skills a facilitator needs—the right facilitator makes all the difference• create memorable learning experiences, not simply educational programs The authors' goal is nothing less than to spark a worldwide revolution of informed practitioners, employees, and business leaders who will demand diversity training be given the same time, resources, and attention as any other critical enterprise initiative.Reading group discussion guide available in book.","tags":["Business","Human Resources","Workforce Diversity","Diversity and Inclusion"]},{"id":"0131014064","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Field Guide to Wireless LANs for Administrators and Power Users, A","authors":["Thomas Maufer"],"pages":"368","publication_date":"October 2003","description":"Deploy, manage, and troubleshoot any wireless LAN ... home or business\n\nWLAN technology for non-experts: clear, accurate, easy\n\nProven quick-start configurations for Windows®, and Linux®, and MacOS®\n\nNo-hassle wireless security solutions\n\nCovers IEEE 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, and 802.11i/WPA\n\nContrasts IEEE 802.11 WLAN technology with IEEE 802.16 WMAN and IEEE 802.15 WPAN technology\n\nExpert knowledge and insight for deploying and managing any wireless LAN.\n\nIn this book, best-selling networking author Thomas Maufer explains how wireless LANs work, and how to make them work for you-reliably and securely.

This vast data becomes the new natural resource that these organizations must tap in to innovate and stay ahead of the competition, and they must do so in a secure environment that protects the data throughout its lifecyle and data access in real time at any time.\n\nWhen it comes to security, nothing can rival IBM® Z, the multi-workload transactional platform that powers the core business processes of the majority of the Fortune 500 enterprises with unmatched security, availability, reliability, and scalability. With core transactions and data originating on IBM Z, it simply makes sense for analytics to exist and run on the same platform.\n\nFor years, some businesses chose to move their sensitive data off IBM Z to platforms that include data lakes, Hadoop, and warehouses for analytics processing. However, the massive growth of digital data, the punishing cost of security exposures as well as the unprecedented demand for instant actionable intelligence from data in real time have convinced them to rethink that decision and, instead, embrace the strategy of data gravity for analytics. At the core of data gravity is the conviction that analytics must exist and run where the data resides. An IBM client eloquently compares this change in analytics strategy to a shift from \"moving the ocean to the boat to moving the boat to the ocean,\" where the boat is the analytics and the ocean is the data.\n\nIBM respects and invests heavily on data gravity because it recognizes the tremendous benefits that data gravity can deliver to you, including reduced cost and minimized security risks. IBM Machine Learning for z/OS® is one of the offerings that decidedly move analytics to Z where your mission-critical data resides. In the inherently secure Z environment, your machine learning scoring services can co-exist with your transactional applications and data, supporting high throughput and minimizing response time while delivering consistent service level agreements (SLAs).\n\nThis book introduces Machine Learning for z/OS version 1.1.0 and describes its unique value proposition. It provides step-by-step guidance for you to get started with the program, including best practices for capacity planning, installation and configuration, administration and operation. Through a retail example, the book shows how you can use the versatile and intuitive web user interface to quickly train, build, evaluate, and deploy a model. Most importantly, it examines use cases across industries to illustrate how you can easily turn your massive data into valuable insights with Machine Learning for z/OS.","tags":["Software Development","Operating Systems","z/OS"]},{"id":"9781604912401","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Leadership in Action: Issues and Observations—Debunking Generational Differences","authors":["Michael T.

Davidson"],"pages":"240","publication_date":"December 2011","description":"The idea for this book came to Martin Davidson during a disarmingly honest conversation with a CFO he worked with. “Look,” the executive said, clearly troubled. “I know we can get a diverse group of people around the table. But so what? What difference does it really make to getting bottom-line results?”Answering the “so what?” led Davidson to explore the flaws in how companies typically manage diversity. They don't integrate diversity into their overall business strategy. They focus on differences that have little impact on their business. And often their diversity efforts end up hindering the professional development of the very people they were designed to help. Davidson explains how what he calls Leveraging Difference™ turns persistent diversity problems into solutions that drive business results. Difference becomes a powerful source of sustainable competitive advantage instead of a distracting mandate handed down from HR.To begin with, leaders must identify the differences most important to achieving organizational goals, even if the differences aren't the obvious ones. The second challenge is to help employees work together to understand the ways these differences matter to the business. Finally, leaders need to experiment with how to use these relevant differences to get things done. Davidson provides compelling examples of how organizations have tackled each of these challenges.Ultimately this is a book about leadership. As with any other strategic imperative, leaders need to take an active role—drive rather than just delegate. Successfully leveraging difference can be what distinguishes an ordinary organization from an extraordinary one.","tags":["Business","Human Resources","Workforce Diversity"]},{"id":"0738490245","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Business Value of DB2 UDB for z/OS","authors":["Paolo Bruni","Paul Bartak","Rick Butler"],"pages":"230","publication_date":"June 2005","description":"We are in a new phase of On Demand Business.

The cornerstone for building these new user interfaces is XAML (\"Zammel\"), the XML-based markup language that works with Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), Vista's new graphics subsystem.\n\nAn acronym for Extensible Application Markup Language, XAML offers a wealth of new controls and elements with exciting capabilities, including animation and rendering of 3D graphics. Windows developers are already jazzed by the possibilities of using XAML for fixed and flow format documents like PDF and HTML, 2D and 3D vector-based graphics, form development, animation, audio and video, transparent layering, and a lot more. Many feel that XAML will eliminate the need for multiple file formats or plug-ins (read: Flash), while lowering development costs and reducing time to market.\n\nThe problem is, most developers don't know XAML. While it is fairly easy to understand, you still need a quick guide to bring you up to speed before Vista's release, and that's where this book's simple, no nonsense approach comes in.\n\nXAML in a Nutshell covers everything necessary to design user interfaces and .NET applications that take advantage of WPF. Prerequisites such as Microsoft's new unified build system, MSBuild, and core XAML constructs and syntax--including shortcuts--are all presented with plenty of examples to get you started. The Core XAML Reference section lets you dig even deeper into syntax rules and attributes for all XAML elements with a series of quick-reference chapters. This section divides XAML elements into logical categories of elements, controls, shapes and geometry, layout, animations, and transformations for easy reference.\n\nXAML in a Nutshell helps you learn, firsthand, how to use this XML-based markup language to implement the new generation of user interface graphics. As one reviewer noted, \"Strong code examples and an efficient, conversational style take the tedium out of learning XAML and make the subject understandable--even interesting.\"","tags":["Data","Data Engineering","Storage Formats","XML","XAML"]},{"id":"0596101449","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Wireless Hacks, 2nd Edition","authors":["Rob Flickenger","Roger Weeks"],"pages":"466","publication_date":"November 2005","description":"The popularity of wireless networking has grown exponentially over the past few years, despite a general downward trend in the telecommunications industry.

With the SAX2 API, developers have access to the information in XML documents as they are read, without imposing major memory constraints or a large code footprint. SAX2 is often used by other APIs \"under the covers\", and provides a foundation for processing and creating both XML and non-XML information. While generally considered the most efficient approach to handling XML document parsing, SAX2 also carries a significant learning curve. In SAX2, author David Brownell explores the many details of managing XML parsers, filtering the information those parsers return, generating your own SAX2 events to convert non-XML information to an XML form, and developing strategies for using event-based parsing in a variety of application scenarios. Created in a public process by the XML-Dev mailing list, the SAX2 API is compact and highly functional. SAX2 uses callbacks to report the information in an XML document as the document is read, allowing you to create your own program structures around the content of documents. No intermediary model of an entire XML document is necessary, and the mapping from XML structures to Java structures and back is straightforward. Both developers learning about SAX2 for the first time and developers returning for reference and advanced material about SAX2 will find useful information in this book. Chapters provide detailed explanations and examples of many different aspects of SAX2 development, while appendices provide a reference to the API and an explanation of the relationships between the SAX2 API and the XML Information Set. While the core of the API is quite approachable, many of its more advanced features are both obscure and powerful. You can use SAX2 to filter, modify, and restructure information in layers of processing which make it easy to reuse generic tools. SAX2 also has some significant limitations that applications need to address in their own ways. This new book gives you the detail and examples required to use SAX2 to its full potential, taking advantage of its power while avoiding its limitations.","tags":["Data","Data Engineering","Storage Formats","XML"]},{"id":"9780937175262","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Xlib Reference Manual for Version 11 of the X Window System","authors":["Adrian Nye"],"pages":"723","publication_date":"January 1989","description":"A complete programmer's reference for X library functions, which is the lowest level of programming interface to X.\n\nReference pages for each Xlib function\n\nA permuted index to the Xlib functions\n\nreference pages for each event type\n\nDescription of macros\n\nA listing of the standard color name database\n\nAlphabetical index and description of structures\n\nAlphabetical index and description of defined symbols\n\nA list of keysyms and their meanings, including sample characters\n\nA list and illustration of the standard cursor font\n\nA list of standard fonts with illustration of each font\n\nA function group index, for finding the right routine for a particular task\n\nSingle-page reference aids for the GC and window attributes\n\nThis reference manual provides reference pages for each Xlib function, a permuted index to the Xlib functions, reference pages for each event type, description of macros, a listing of the standard color database, an alphabetic index and description of structures and defined symbols, a list of keysyms and their meanings, a list and illustration of the standard cursor font, an illustrated list of the standard fonts, a function group index, for finding the right routine for a particular task, and single-page reference aids for the GC and window attributes.","tags":["Data","Data Engineering","XQuery"]},{"id":"9781484219164","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Java XML and JSON","authors":["Jeff Friesen"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"June 2016","description":"Java XML and JSON is your one-stop guide to mastering the XML metalanguage and JSON data format along with significant Java APIs for parsing and creating XML/JSON documents (and more).

Originally developed by Netscape in 1999, RSS (which can stand for RDF Site Summary, Rich Site Summary, or Really Simple Syndication) is an XML-based format that allows web developers to describe and syndicate web site content. Using RSS files allows developers to create a data feed that supplies headlines, links, and article summaries from a web site. Other sites can then incorporate them into their pages automatically. Although RSS is in widespread use, people struggle with its confusing and sometimes conflicting documentation and versions. Content Syndication with RSS is the first book to provide a comprehensive reference to the specifications and the tools that make syndication possible. Content Syndication with RSS offers webloggers, developers, and the programmers who support them a thorough explanation of syndication in general and RSS in particular. Written for web developers who want to offer XML-based feeds of their content, as well as developers who want to use the content that other people are syndicating, the book explores and explains metadata interpretation, different forms of content syndication, and the increasing use of web services in this field. This concise volume begins with an introduction to content syndication on the Internet: its purpose, limitations, and traditions, and answers the question of why would you consider \"giving your content away\" like this? Next, the book delves into the architecture of content syndication with an overview of the entire system, from content author to end user on another site. You'll follow the flow of data: content, referral data, publish-and-subscribe calls, with a detailed look at the protocols and standards possible at each step.

The latter have had to find ways to break or circumvent this protection.\n\nThis book analyzes the evolution of the means of communication and interception, as well as their implementation since the advent of the telegraph in the 19th century. It presents this sensitive subject from a technical, historical and political perspective, and answers several questions: who are the actors of interception? Who has produced the recent technologies? How are the markets for interception means organized? Are the means of protecting communications infallible? Or what forms of power do interceptions confer?","tags":["Hardware","Wireless Technology","Telecommunications"]},{"id":"0672324717","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Sams Teach Yourself XML in 10 Minutes","authors":["Andrew H.

As the title of this book suggests, the z/TPF system uses open, standard interfaces to create services. Integration of new applications with existing z/TPF functions is a key factor in extending application capabilities. The ability for service data objects (SDO) to access the z/TPF Database Facility (z/TPFDF) provides a framework for data application program development that includes an architecture and application programming interfaces (APIs). SDO access to z/TPFDF provides remote client applications with access to z/TPF traditional data.\n\nIn the simplest terms, service-oriented architecture (SOA) is a means by which like, or unlike, systems can communicate with one another despite differences between each system's heritage. SOA can neutralize the differences between systems so that they understand one another. SOA support for z/TPF is a means by which z/TPF can interact with other systems that also support SOA. This book discusses various aspects of SOA in the z/TPF system, including explanations and examples to help z/TPF users implement SOA. IBM WebSphere® Application Server was chosen as the partner system as a means of demonstrating how a world class transaction server and a world class application server can work together. This book shows you how you can exploit z/TPF as a transaction server, participating in a SOA structure alongside WebSphere Application Server.\n\nThis IBM Redbooks® publication provides an introduction to z/TPF and the technologies critical to SOA. z/TPF is positioned as a provider or consumer in an SOA by supporting SOAP processing, communication bindings, and Extensible Markup Language (XML). An example is used to show how z/TPF can be used both as a Web service provider and as a consumer. A second example shows how to use WebSphere Operational Decision Management to apply business rules. A third example shows how business event processing can be incorporated in z/TPF applications. An example is also used to discuss security aspects, including z/TPF XML encryption and the z/TPF WS-Security wrapper. The main part of the book concludes with a discussion of z/TPF in an open systems environment, including examples of lightweight implementations to fit z/TPF, such as the HTTP server for the z/TPF system. The appendixes include information and examples using TPF Toolkit, sample code, and workarounds (with yes, more examples).","tags":["Software Development","Operating Systems","z/OS"]},{"id":"9780132984355","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Windows 8 Apps with XAML and C# Unleashed","authors":["Adam Nathan"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"December 2012","description":"Windows 8 enables you to build stunning applications that integrate with each other, services, and Windows itself like never before.

This explains the emergence of cognitive radio (CR) - the sharing of the spectrum between a primary user and a secondary user.\n\nIn this book, we will present the state of the art of the different techniques for spectrum access using cooperation and competition to solve the problem of spectrum allocation and ensure better management of radio resources in a radio cognitive context.\n\nThe different aspects of research explored up until now on the applications of multi-agent systems (MAS) in the field of cognitive radio are analyzed in this book. The first chapter begins with an insight into wireless networks and mobiles, with special focus on the IEEE 802.22 norm, which is a norm dedicated to CR. Chapter 2 goes into detail about CR, which is a technical field at the boundary between telecommunications and Artificial Intelligence (AI). In Chapter 3, the concept of the \"agent\" from AI is expanded to MAS and associated applications. Finally, Chapter 4 establishes an overview of the use of AI techniques, in particular MAS, for its allocation of radio resources and dynamic access to the spectrum in CR.","tags":["Hardware","Wireless Technology","Telecommunications","Radio","Cognitive Radio"]},{"id":"0130649074","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Essential Guide to Telecommunications, The, Third Edition","authors":["Annabel Z.

Likewise, its IBM z/OS® operating system is far superior to its predecessors in providing, among many other capabilities, world-class and state-of-the-art support for the TCP/IP Internet protocol suite.\n\nTCP/IP is a large and evolving collection of communication protocols managed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), an open, volunteer organization. Because of its openness, the TCP/IP protocol suite has become the foundation for the set of technologies that form the basis of the Internet. The convergence of IBM mainframe capabilities with Internet technology, connectivity, and standards (particularly TCP/IP) is dramatically changing information technology and driving requirements for even more secure, scalable, and highly available mainframe TCP/IP implementations.\n\nThe IBM z/OS Communications Server TCP/IP Implementation series provides understandable, step-by-step guidance for enabling the most commonly used and important functions of z/OS Communications Server TCP/IP.\n\nThis IBM Redbooks® publication is for people who install and support z/OS Communications Server. It starts by describing virtual IP addressing (VIPA) for high-availability, with and without a dynamic routing protocol. It describes several workload balancing approaches with the z/OS Communications Server. It also explains optimized sysplex distributor intra-sysplex load balancing. This function represents improved application support using optimized local connections together with weight values from extended Workload Manager (WLM) interfaces. Finally, this book highlights important tuning parameters and suggests parameter values to maximize performance in many client installations.","tags":["Software Development","Operating Systems","z/OS"]},{"id":"9781492057284","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Windows 10 May 2019 Update: The Missing Manual","authors":["David Pogue"],"pages":"639","publication_date":"May 2019","description":"The Windows 10 May 2019 Update adds a host of new and improved features to Microsoft’s flagship operating system—and this jargon-free guide helps you get the most out of every component.\n\nThis in-depth Missing Manual covers the entire system and introduces you to the latest features in the Windows Professional, Enterprise, Education, and Home editions.

From the system point of view, DB2's integration with zSeries and disk storage architecture is the cornerstone for data integrity. Logging functionality and COPY and RECOVER utilities are the building blocks for bringing the table space back to a current or consistent status in case of hardware or software failures or when application events need to be rerun.From the application point of view, DB2 supports locking and commit at the transaction level, and general data integrity (at entity and semantic level), and a set of referential constraint rules for each parent/dependent table relationship. The tables linked by referential integrity are recognized during the execution of the QUIESCE utility. Other logical relations across tables, necessary to support business rules, are implemented via constraints, triggers, user defined functions, and user defined tables. Informational constraints also exist, they are not enforced by the database manager, they are used to improve query performance. In this IBM Redbooks publication, we briefly describe the integration of DB2 for z/OS with System z architecture, we then explore the data integrity options and utilize the standard recovery functions for application-related issues.","tags":["Software Development","Operating Systems","z/OS"]},{"id":"9780738461199","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"IBM Z Flexible Capacity for Cyber Resiliency","authors":["Ewerson Palacio","Markus Ertl","Octavian Lascu"],"pages":"48","publication_date":"June 2023","description":"With IBM Z Flexible Capacity for Cyber Resiliency, IBM introduces a new temporary capacity, that offers clients new levels of flexibility and control.

The new Windows combines the same stress-tested, extremely stable engine that drives Windows 2000-Microsoft's corporate operating system-with the far superior compatibility of Windows Me. Windows XP offers dozens of important new features. In addition to the vastly more elegant user interface, it offers drag-and-drop CD burning, powerful built-in features for viewing and managing digital photos and music, and a Remote Assistance feature that lets invited PC gurus or help-desk technicians see and even manipulate what's on your screen over the Internet. But one major failing of Windows remains unaddressed in the XP edition: It comes without a single page of printed instructions. In Windows XP Home Edition: The Missing Manual, New York Times technology columnist (and Missing Manual series creator) David Pogue provides the friendly, authoritative book that should have been in the box. It's the ideal users' guide for the world's most popular operating system. The book begins at the beginning: with a tour of the Desktop, the new, two-column Start menu, and instructions for customizing the Taskbar and toolbars. A special focus: Organizing files, folders, and windows for maximum efficiency and minimum clutter. More advanced chapters explore each control panel and built-in application; walk through every conceivable configuration (setting up a PC for Internet use, peripheral equipment, laptop life, and so on); and setting up a small network, including how to share a single Internet connection among several PCs. Finally, special chapters are dedicated to standard rituals of Windows life: troubleshooting, installation, and upgrading. Windows XP Home Edition: The Missing Manual is a one-stop reference for the Windows user. In keeping with the high standards of the Missing Manual line, the book features superb writing, special features for both absolute novices and power users, and complete coverage. If Microsoft could wave its magic software wand and wish for the perfect guide to its flagship product, Windows XP Home Edition: The Missing Manual would appear like magic.","tags":["Software Development","Operating Systems","MS Operating Systems","Windows"]},{"id":"9780321572967","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Microsoft Windows Vista, Second Edition: Visual QuickStart Guide","authors":["Chris Fehily"],"pages":"640","publication_date":"April 2008","description":"Microsoft's Windows Vista will open up for its users a whole new way of using their PCs.

These redbooks describe how IMS exploits the Parallel Sysplex functions and how to plan for, implement, and operate IMS systems working together in a Parallel Sysplex. We use the term IMSplex to refer to multiple IMSs, which are cooperating with each other in a Parallel Sysplex environment to process a common shared workload. Although we generally think of an IMSplex in terms of online environments, an IMSplex can include batch IMS jobs as well as IMS utilities. IMS in the Parallel Sysplex, Volume I: Reviewing the IMSplex Technology, SG24-6908 described the Parallel Sysplex and how IMS exploits the Parallel Sysplex to provide user services including data sharing, shared queues, VTAM generic resources, automatic restart management (ARM), and systems management functions. When migrating an IMS system from a single, non-sharing environment to one which invokes some or all of these services, or even when incorporating additional function into an existing IMSplex (for example, upgrading a data sharing system to also use shared queues), the migration process must be carefully planned. Many decisions must be made, compromises made, perhaps even some application or database changes made. There will be changes to system definition and to operational procedures.\n\nThis book addresses the development of the migration plan and identifies some of the steps and considerations you might encounter when developing the plan. The result of this exercise is not to perform any of the implementation tasks but to identify those tasks which must be done and to create a plan for accomplishing them. For example, the plan can identify as a task the establishment of a naming convention for system data sets. The naming convention itself is not a part of the plan, but is a result of implementing the plan.\n\nIn this book we present planning considerations for the IMSplex. Separate chapters are devoted to: -Block level data sharing -Shared queues -Connectivity -Systems management -The overall IMSplex environment\n\nThe other volumes in this series are: -IMS in the Parallel Sysplex, Volume I: Reviewing the IMSplex Technology, SG24-6908 -IMS in the Parallel Sysplex, Volume III: IMSplex Implementation and Operations, SG24-6929","tags":["Software Development","Operating Systems","z/OS"]},{"id":"9781118066904","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"WordPress® 24-Hour Trainer, Second Edition","authors":["George Plumley"],"pages":"394","publication_date":"August 2011","description":"The eagerly anticipated second edition, completely updated for WordPress 3.1\n\nAs an open source content management system, WordPress allows users to easily build feature-rich web sites with no programming experience.

Beginning with z/OS V1R7, there are no restrictions for file system structures that should be kept as HFS instead of zFS. This IBM Redbooks® publication helps you to install, tailor, and configure new zFS file systems. This information can be used by system administrators who work with the zFS component of the IBM z/OS Distributed File Service base element. The book provides a broad description of the new architecture of the zFS file system. You can use it as a reference when converting HFS file systems to zFS file systems.

This topic is highly motivated due to important environmental, financial, and quality-of-experience (QoE) considerations. Specifically, the high energy consumption of the wireless networks manifests in approximately 2% of all CO2 emissions worldwide. This book presents the authors’ visions and solutions for deployment of energy efficient (green) heterogeneous wireless communication networks. The book consists of three major parts. The first part provides an introduction to the \"green networks\" concept, the second part targets the green multi-homing resource allocation problem, and the third chapter presents a novel deployment of device-to-device (D2D) communications and its successful integration in Heterogeneous Networks (HetNets).\n\nThe book is novel in that it specifically targets green networking in a heterogeneous wireless medium, which represents the current and future wireless communication medium faced by the existing and next generation communication networks. The book focuses on multi-homing resource allocation, exploiting network cooperation, and integrating different and new network technologies (radio frequency and VLC), expanding the network coverage and integrating new device centric communication paradigms such as D2D Communications. Whilst the book discusses a significant research topic supported with advanced mathematical analysis, the resulting algorithms and solutions are explained and summarized in a way that is easy to follow and grasp.

Superseding earlier technologies, such as COM/DCOM, .NET Remoting, ASP.NET Web Services, and the Web Services Enhancements for .NET, WCF provides a single solution that is designed to always be the best way to exchange data among software entities. It also provides the infrastructure for developing the next generation of Web services, with support for the WS-* family of specifications, and a new serialization system for enhanced performance. For information technology professionals, WCF supplies an impressive array of administration tools that enterprises and software vendors can use to reduce the cost of ownership of their solutions without writing a single line of code. Most important, WCF finally delivers on the long-postponed promise of model-driven software development with the new software factory approach, by which one can iteratively design solutions in a modeling language and generate executables from lower-level class libraries.\n\nWindows Communication Foundation Unleashed is designed to be the best resource for software developers and architects working with WCF. The book guides readers toward a conceptual understanding of all the facilities of WCF and provides step-by-step guides to applying the technology to practical problems.\n\nIntroduces you to WCF and then takes you deep inside the technology\n\nGives you nearly 100 best practices for programming with WCF\n\nProvides detailed coverage on how to version services that you will not find anywhere else\n\nDelves into using WCF together with Windows Workflow Foundation and Windows CardSpace\n\nProvides detailed coverage of the new high-performance data contract serializer for .NET\n\nWalks you through how to do secure, reliable, transacted messaging, and how to understand the options available\n\nIntroduces you to federated, claims-based security, and shows you how to incorporate SAML and WS-Trust security token services into your architecture\n\nProvides step-by-step instructions for how to customize every aspect of WCF\n\nShows you how to add your own behaviors, communication channels, message encoders, and transports\n\nGives you options for implementing publish/subscribe solutions\n\nWalks you through how to do peer-to-peer communications with WCF\n\nAs evangelists at Microsoft for WCF, Craig McMurtry, Marc Mercuri, Nigel Watling, and Matt Winkler are uniquely positioned to write this book.

We then proceed to show how VIPA can be used for high availability—both with and without using a dynamic routing protocol. Then we discuss a number of different workload balancing approaches that can be used with the z/OS Communications Server. In this book we use the terms internal and external application workload balancing to refer to approaches where the decision as to which application instance should received a given connection request is made within the sysplex environment (such as by Sysplex Distributor) or outside of it (using a separate, external, workload balancing solution), respectively. Finally, we explain the optimized Sysplex Distributor intra-sysplex load balancing. This function is an improved multi-tier application support using optimized local connections together with weight values from extended WLM interfaces.

In 2019, the gap between the percentage of women and the percentage of men in the workforce was the smallest on record. But despite these statistics, women remain underrepresented in positions of power and status, with the highest-paying jobs the most gender-imbalanced. Even in fields where the numbers of men and women are roughly equal, or where women actually make up the majority, leadership ranks remain male-dominated.\n\nThe persistence of these inequalities begs the question: Why haven't we made more progress?\n\nIn Glass Half-Broken, Colleen Ammerman and Boris Groysberg reveal the pervasive organizational obstacles and managerial actions—limited opportunities for development, lack of role models and sponsors, and bias in hiring, compensation, and promotion—that create gender imbalances. Bringing to light the key findings from the latest research in psychology, sociology, organizational behavior, and economics, Ammerman and Groysberg show that throughout their careers—from entry-level to mid-level to senior-level positions—women get pushed out of the leadership pipeline, each time for different reasons. Presenting organizational and managerial strategies designed to weaken and ultimately break down these barriers, Glass Half-Broken is the authoritative resource that managers and leaders at all levels can use to finally shatter the glass ceiling.","tags":["Business","Human Resources","Workforce Diversity"]},{"id":"0789735423","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Creating a Digital Home Entertainment System with Windows Media Center","authors":["Michael Miller"],"pages":"408","publication_date":"April 2006","description":"Even though the Windows Media Center interface is simple to operate, not all activities are intuitive or easy to implement.

In Through the Labyrinth, Alice Eagly and Linda Carli examine why women's paths to power remain difficult to traverse. First, Eagly and Carli prove that the glass ceiling is no longer a useful metaphor and offer seven reasons why. They propose the labyrinth as a better image and explain how to navigate through it. This important and practical book addresses such critical questions as: How far have women actually come as leaders? Do stereotypes and prejudices still limit women's opportunities? Do people resist women's leadership more than men's? And, do organisations create obstacles to women who would be leaders?This book's rich analysis is founded on scientific research from psychology, economics, sociology, political science, and management. The authors ground their conclusions in that research and invoke a wealth of engaging anecdotes and personal accounts to illustrate the practical principles that emerge. With excellent leadership in short supply, no group, organisation, or nation can afford to restrict women's access to leadership roles. This book evaluates whether such restrictions are present and, when they are, what we can do to eliminate them.","tags":["Business","Human Resources","Workforce Diversity"]},{"id":"9781647821388","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Our Separate Ways, With a New Preface and Epilogue","authors":["Ella Bell Smith","Stella M.

And while gender is a common denominator among these women, race and class are often wedges between them.\n\nIn Our Separate Ways, Ella Bell Smith and Stella M. Nkomo take an unflinching look at the surprising differences between Black and White women's trials and triumphs on their way to the top. Based on groundbreaking research, the book compares and contrasts the experiences of 120 Black and White female managers in America. Powerful stories bring to life the women's often difficult journeys from childhood to professional success, highlighting the roles that gender, race, and class played in their development.\n\nNow with an updated preface and epilogue, the book provides candid discussions of the continuing challenge of achieving race and gender equality in the midst of deep political and ideological divides. You'll discover how White women have—perhaps unwittingly—aligned themselves more often with White men than with Black women and how systemic racism and biases still exist in organizations. But you’ll also learn what to do to leverage the talents of all women and eliminate systemic racism for good.\n\nWhether you lead an organization or simply want to better understand the dynamics at play in business today, you'll discover provocative ideas for creating a better workplace and encouraging equality for everyone.","tags":["Business","Human Resources","Workforce Diversity"]},{"id":"9781597491372","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"How to Cheat at Configuring Exchange Server 2007","authors":["Henrik Walther"],"pages":"624","publication_date":"April 2011","description":"The Perfect Reference for the Multitasked System AdministratorsThe new version of Exchange is an ambitious overhaul that tries to balance the growing needs for performance, cost effectiveness, and security.

In a world where the talent pool is becoming increasingly diverse, it's more important than ever for leaders to truly understand how to support inclusion.Drawing on years of work with many leading organizations, Jennifer Brown shows what leaders at any level can do to spark real change. She guides readers through the Inclusive Leader Continuum, a set of four developmental stages: unaware, aware, active, and advocate. Brown describes the hallmarks of each stage, the behaviors and mind-sets that inform it, and what readers can do to keep progressing. Whether you're a powerful CEO or a new employee without direct reports, there are actions you can take that can drastically change the day-to-day reality for your colleagues and the trajectory of your organization.Anyone can—and should—be an inclusive leader. Brown lays out simple steps to help you understand your role, boost your self-awareness, take action, and become a better version of yourself in the process. This book will meet you where you are and provide a road map to create a workplace of greater mutual understanding where everyone's talents can shine.","tags":["Business","Human Resources","Workforce Diversity"]},{"id":"9781394292738","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Reception of Weak Radio Signals from Space","authors":["Miroslav Kasal"],"pages":"240","publication_date":"August 2025","description":"Comprehensive resource on the dynamically developing issue of radio communication over long distances, especially in outer space\n\nReception of Weak Radio Signals from Space explores all aspects of detecting and making sense of extremely weak radio frequency (RF) signals, especially those emanating from space.
