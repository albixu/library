Now this same team provides the best explanation yet of these new features, and of concurrency in general. Concurrency is no longer a subject for advanced users only. Every Java developer should read this book.\"\n\n--Martin Buchholz\n\nJDK Concurrency Czar, Sun Microsystems\n\n\"For the past 30 years, computer performance has been driven by Moore’s Law; from now on, it will be driven by Amdahl’s Law. Writing code that effectively exploits multiple processors can be very challenging.

This book is a must-read for anyone who uses threads and cares about performance.\"\n\n--Kirk Pepperdine\n\nCTO, JavaPerformanceTuning.com\n\n\"This book covers a very deep and subtle topic in a very clear and concise way, making it the perfect Java Concurrency reference manual.

Effectively exploiting concurrency is becoming more and more important now that Moore’s Law is delivering more cores but not faster cores, and this book will show you how to do it.\"\n\n--Dr. Cliff Click\n\nSenior Software Engineer, Azul Systems\n\n\"I have a strong interest in concurrency, and have probably written more thread deadlocks and made more synchronization mistakes than most programmers.

As multicore processors become the norm, using concurrency effectively becomes essential for building high-performance applications. Java SE 5 and 6 are a huge step forward for the development of concurrent applications, with improvements to the Java Virtual Machine to support high-performance, highly scalable concurrent classes and a rich set of new concurrency building blocks. In Java Concurrency in Practice, the creators of these new facilities explain not only how they work and how to use them, but also the motivation and design patterns behind them.\n\nHowever, developing, testing, and debugging multithreaded programs can still be very difficult; it is all too easy to create concurrent programs that appear to work, but fail when it matters most: in production, under heavy load. Java Concurrency in Practice arms readers with both the theoretical underpinnings and concrete techniques for building reliable, scalable, maintainable concurrent applications. Rather than simply offering an inventory of concurrency APIs and mechanisms, it provides design rules, patterns, and mental models that make it easier to build concurrent programs that are both correct and performant.\n\nThis book covers:\n\nBasic concepts of concurrency and thread safety\n\nTechniques for building and composing thread-safe classes\n\nUsing the concurrency building blocks in java.util.concurrent\n\nPerformance optimization dos and don’ts\n\nTesting concurrent programs\n\nAdvanced topics such as atomic variables, nonblocking algorithms, and the Java Memory Model","tags":["Software Development","Programming Languages","JVM Languages","Java"]},{"id":"9781617293566","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Modern Java in Action","authors":["Raoul-Gabriel Urma","Mario Fusco","Alan Mycroft"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"October 2018","description":"Manning's bestselling Java 8 book has been revised for Java 9 and 10!

It's a faithful watchdog that keeps intruders out of your networks. But it has been equally fierce to system administrators, for whom the complexity of Kerberos is legendary.Single sign-on is the holy grail of network administration, and Kerberos is the only game in town. Microsoft, by integrating Kerberos into Active Directory in Windows 2000 and 2003, has extended the reach of Kerberos to all networks large or small. Kerberos makes your network more secure and more convenient for users by providing a single authentication system that works across the entire network. One username; one password; one login is all you need.Fortunately, help for administrators is on the way. Kerberos: The Definitive Guide shows you how to implement Kerberos for secure authentication. In addition to covering the basic principles behind cryptographic authentication, it covers everything from basic installation to advanced topics like cross-realm authentication, defending against attacks on Kerberos, and troubleshooting.In addition to covering Microsoft's Active Directory implementation, Kerberos: The Definitive Guide covers both major implementations of Kerberos for Unix and Linux: MIT and Heimdal. It shows you how to set up Mac OS X as a Kerberos client.

Anyone with a working knowledge of Java will understand the puzzles, but even the most seasoned veteran will find them challenging.\n\nMost of the puzzles take the form of a short program whose behavior isn't what it seems. Can you figure out what it does? Puzzles are grouped loosely according to the features they use, and detailed solutions follow each puzzle. The solutions go well beyond a simple explanation of the program's behavior--they show you how to avoid the underlying traps and pitfalls for good. A handy catalog of traps and pitfalls at the back of the book provides a concise taxonomy for future reference.\n\nSolve these puzzles and you'll never again fall prey to the counterintuitive or obscure behaviors that can fool even the most experienced programmers.","tags":["Software Development","Programming Languages","JVM Languages","Java"]},{"id":"9781838555726","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Mastering Kotlin","authors":["Nate Ebel"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"October 2019","description":"Mastering Kotlin delves deep into the advanced features of the Kotlin programming language, enabling you to build robust and scalable applications for Android, iOS, web, and backend services.

Change that begins with one small step . . .\n\nIt’s The Spirit of Kaizen—a proven system for implementing small, incremental steps that can have a big impact in reaching your goals. This step-by-step guide from renowned psychologist and consultant Dr. Robert Maurer shows you how to:\n\nLower costs—by offering little rewards\nRaise quality—by reducing mistakes\nManage difficult people— one step at a time\nBoost morale and productivity— in five minutes a day\nImplement big ideas—through small but steady actions\nSell more—in less time\n\nFilled with practical tips and ready-to-use tools for managers, innovators, and entrepreneurs, The Spirit of Kaizen is the essential handbook for a changing world. You’ll learn how to think outside the suggestion box, remove mental blindfolds, manage stress with one-minute exercises, and handle rising health-care costs. You’ll discover the “small step” secrets for dealing with all kinds of people, from tough bosses and listless workers to stubborn clients and fussy customers.\n\nThese simple but powerful techniques can be applied to almost any workplace situation, especially when you’re trying to navigate the stormy waters of radical change, high-pressure deadlines, and cutthroat competition. These are the same methods of small, continual improvement that have been tested by the largest companies, such as Boeing, Toyota, and the U.S. Navy—methods that will work for you, too.\n\nNo matter how big the obstacle or how big the dream, The Spirit of Kaizen has a small-step solution to help you succeed.","tags":["Business","Project & Product Management","Product Management","Kaizen"]},{"id":"9781430234524","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Pro Spring Batch","authors":["Michael T. Minella"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"July 2011","description":"Since its release, Spring Framework has transformed virtually every aspect of Java development including web applications, security, aspect-oriented programming, persistence, and messaging. Spring Batch, one of its newer additions, now brings the same familiar Spring idioms to batch processing. Spring Batch addresses the needs of any batch process, from the complex calculations performed in the biggest financial institutions to simple data migrations that occur with many software development projects.\n\nPro Spring Batch is intended to answer three questions:\n\nWhat? What is batch processing? What does it entail? What makes it different from the other applications we are developing? What are the challenges inherent in the development of a batch process?\n\nWhy? Why do batch processing? Why can't we just process things as we get them? Why do we do batch processing differently than the web applications that we currently work on?\n\nHow? How to implement a robust, scalable, distributed batch processing system using open-source frameworks\n\nPro Spring Batch gives concrete examples of how each piece of functionality is used and why it would be used in a real-world application. This includes providing tips that the \"school of hard knocks\" has taught author Michael Minella during his experience with Spring Batch. Pro Spring Batch includes examples of I/O options that are not mentioned in the official user's guide, as well as performance tips on things like how to limit the impact of maintaining the state of your jobs.\n\nThe author also walks you through, from end to end, the design and implementation of a batch process based upon a theoretical real-world example. This includes basic project setup, implementation, testing, tuning and scaling for large volumes.\n\nWhat you'll learn\n\nBatch concepts and how they relate to the Spring Batch framework\n\nHow to use declarative I/O using the Spring Batch readers/writers\n\nData integrity techniques used by Spring Batch, including transactions and job state/restartability\n\nHow to scale batch jobs via distributed batch processing\n\nHow to handle testing batch processes (Unit and functional)\n\nWho this book is for\n\nJava developers with Spring experience.\n\nJava Architects designing batch solutions\n\nMore specifically, this book is intended for those who have a solid foundation in the core Java platform. Batch processing covers a wide spectrum of topics, not all of which are covered in detail in this book. Concepts in Java which the reader should be comfortable with include file I/O, JDBC, and transactions. Given that Spring Batch is a framework built upon the open-source IoC container Spring, which will not be covered in this book, it is expected that the reader will be familiar with its concepts and conventions. With that in mind, the reader is not expected to have any prior exposure to the Spring Batch framework. All concepts related to it will be explained in detail, with working examples.","tags":["Software Development","Programming Languages","JVM Languages","Java","Spring","Spring Batch"]},{"id":"9781484242407","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Learn Keras for Deep Neural Networks: A Fast-Track Approach to Modern Deep Learning with Python","authors":["Jojo Moolayil"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"December 2018","description":"Learn, understand, and implement deep neural networks in a math- and programming-friendly approach using Keras and Python.

Learn how to create efficient, resilient views with Fragments and share data between the views with ViewModels. Use Room to persist valuable data quickly, and avoid NullPointerExceptions and Java's verbose expressions with Kotlin. You can even handle asynchronous web service calls elegantly with Kotlin coroutines. Achieve all of this and much more while building two full-featured apps, following detailed, step-by-step instructions.With Kotlin and Jetpack, Android development is now smoother and more enjoyable than ever before. Dive right in by developing two complete Android apps.\n\nWith the first app, Penny Drop, you create a full game complete with random die rolls, customizable rules, and AI opponents. Build lightweight Fragment views with data binding, quickly and safely update data with ViewModel classes, and handle all app navigation in a single location. Use Kotlin with Android-specific Kotlin extensions to efficiently write null-safe code without all the normal boilerplate required for pre-Jetpack + Kotlin apps. Persist and retrieve data as full objects with the Room library, then display that data with ViewModels and list records in a RecyclerView.\n\nNext, you create the official app for the Android Baseball League. It's a fake league but a real app, where you use what you learn in Penny Drop and build up from there. Navigate all over the app via a Navigation Drawer, including specific locations via Android App Links. Handle asynchronous and web service calls with Kotlin Coroutines, display that data smoothly with the Paging library, and send notifications to a user's phone from your app.\n\nCome build Android apps the modern way with Kotlin and Jetpack!\n\nWhat You Need:\n\nYou'll need the Android SDK, a text editor, and either a real Android device or emulator for testing. While not strictly required, it's assumed you're using Android Studio, which comes with the Android SDK and simplifies creating an emulator. Also, a few examples require JDK 1.8 or later, though all of these pieces can be completed in other ways when using JDK 1.6.","tags":["Software Development","Programming Languages","JVM Languages","Kotlin"]},{"id":"9781788995207","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Java Deep Learning Cookbook","authors":["Rahul Raj"],"pages":"304","publication_date":"November 2019","description":"Dive into deep learning with Java using the powerful Deeplearning4j library.

DSLs give users a way to interact with your applications more effectively, and Kotlin is a fantastic language to serve as a host for internal DSLs, because it greatly reduces the pain and effort of design and development. But implementing DSLs on top of Kotlin requires understanding the key strengths of the language and knowing how to apply them appropriately. Learn to avoid the pitfalls and leverage the language while creating your own elegant, fluent, concise, and robust DSLs using Kotlin.\n\nInternal DSLs remove the burdens of implementing a full blown language compiler. The host language quickly becomes your ally to creating DSLs, but the syntax you can choose for your DSLs is limited to what the host language allows.

Without the baggage of legacy frameworks and virtual machines, Scala Native lets you re-imagine how your programs interact with your operating system. Compile Scala code down to native machine instructions; seamlessly invoke operating system APIs for low-level networking and IO; control pointers, arrays, and other memory management techniques for extreme performance; and enjoy instant start-up times. Skip the JVM and improve your code performance by getting close to the metal.\n\nDevelopers generally build systems on top of the work of those who came before, accumulating layer upon layer of abstraction. Scala Native provides a rare opportunity to remove layers. Without the JVM, Scala Native uses POSIX and ANSI C APIs to build concise, expressive programs that run unusually close to bare metal. Scala Native compiles Scala code down to native machine instructions instead of JVM bytecode. It starts up fast, without the sluggish warm-up phase that's common for just-in-time compilers. Scala Native programs can seamlessly invoke operating system APIs for low-level networking and IO. And Scala Native lets you control pointers, arrays, and other memory layout types for extreme performance.\n\nWrite practical, bare-metal code with Scala Native, step by step. Understand the foundations of systems programming, including pointers, arrays, strings, and memory management. Use the UNIX socket API to write network client and server programs without the sort of frameworks higher-level languages rely on.

Swing provides many new components and containers that allow you to build sophisticated user interfaces, far beyond what was possible with AWT. The old components have been greatly improved, and there are many new components, like trees, tables, and even text editors. It also adds several completely new features to Java's user interface capabilities: drag-and-drop, undo, and the ability to develop your own \"look and feel,\" or the ability to choose between several standard looks. The Swing components are all \"lightweight,\" and therefore provide more uniform behavior across platforms, making it easier to test your software. All these new features mean that there's a lot to learn. Swing is undoubtedly way ahead of AWT -- or, for that matter, any widely available user interface toolkit -- but it's also a lot more complicated. It's still easy to do simple things. But once you've seen what's possible, you won't want to do the simple things. Java Swing gives you in-depth coverage of everything you need to know to take full advantage of Swing, providing detailed descriptions of every class and interface in the key Swing packages. It shows you how to use all of the new components, allowing you to build state-of-the-art user interfaces.

Servlet and JSP(TM) technology is the foundation of this platform: it provides the link between Web clients and server-side applications. In this 2nd edition of the worldwide bestseller, the authors show you how to apply the latest servlet and JSP capabilities. Unlike other books that treat servlet or JSP technology in isolation, Core Servlets and JavaServer Pages provides a unified treatment, showing you when servlet technology is best, when the JSP approach is preferred, and when (and how) servlets and JSP should work together.\n\nPart I provides exhaustive coverage of the servlet 2.4 specification. It starts with server configuration, basic syntax, the servlet life cycle, and use of form data. It moves on to applying HTTP 1.1, cookies, and session tracking. Advanced topics include compressing Web content, incrementally updating results, dynamically generating images, and creating shopping carts.\n\nPart II gives an in-depth guide to JSP 2.0. It covers both the \"classic\" JSP scripting elements and the new JSP 2.0 expression language. It shows how to control the content type, designate error pages, include files, and integrate JavaBeans components. Advanced topics include sharing beans, generating Excel spreadsheets, and dealing with concurrency.\n\nPart III covers two key supporting technologies: HTML forms and database access with JDBC(TM). It explains every standard HTML input element and shows how to use appropriate JDBC drivers, perform database queries, process results, and perform updates. Advanced topics include parameterized queries, stored procedures, and transaction control.\n\nDesign strategies include ways to integrate servlet and JSP technology, best practices for invoking Java code from JSP pages, plans for dealing with missing and malformed data, and application of the MVC architecture.\n\nHandy guides walk you through use of three popular servlet and JSP engines (Apache Tomcat, Macromedia JRun, and Caucho Resin) and some of the most widely used database systems (MySQL, Oracle9i, Microsoft Access).\n\nVolume 2 of this book covers advanced topics: filters, custom tag libraries, database connection pooling, Web application security, the JSP Standard Tag Library (JSTL), Apache Struts, JavaServer Faces (JSF), JAXB, and more.\n\nThe same clear step-by-step explanations that made the first edition so popular\n\nCompletely updated for the latest standards: servlets 2.4 and JSP 2.0\n\nHundreds of completely portable, fully documented,industrial-strength examples\n\nDetailed treatment of Apache Tomcat, Macromedia JRun, and Caucho Resin Online access to all source code, available free for unrestricted use at the author's www.coreservlets.com web site.","tags":["Software Development","Programming Languages","JVM Languages","Java","Jakarta EE","Jakarta Server Pages (JSP)"]},{"id":"9781935182177","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"OSGi in Depth","authors":["Alex Alves"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"December 2011","description":"OSGi in Depth presents practical techniques for implementing OSGi, including enterprise services such as management, configuration, event handling, and software component models.

This book will prepare you for AP CompSci Complete, but you don’t need to be sitting that class to benefit. Computer science has become a basic life skill that everyone is going to need to learn. Whether you are going into a career or side hustle in business, technology, creativity, architecture, or almost any other field, you will find coding and computer science play a role. \n\nSo when we learn programming we are going to focus on three things: what is the process; what is the syntax; and what is the flow. The process is represented as a flowchart. We will learn how to make these to help you plan out what you are going to do before you write a line of code. At first, the flowcharts will be pretty simple, but then they will get more complex. The syntax is the code: this is what you write that translates the process you create in a flowchart to the instructions that the computer can understand. Finally, there is the flow. This is where you trace through the code and see how the data and information it stores along the way changes. You can see how the operation of the program cascades from line to line. You will be building charts that will capture the programming flow so you can better understand how the computer processes code to make your next program easier to conceive and code.\n\nAlong the way to aid in the learning of the essential Java skills, there will be three kinds of project types throughout this book: business software projects for applications where you work for a company and need to complete an internal project for a team such as the sales, marketing, or data science teams; social good projects where you are working for non-profits or for agencies that are trying to research and provide solutions to economic, environmental, medical, or humanitarian projects; and game development projects for games basedon player input, random chance, or other mechanics for the use of entertainment.\n\nWhat is unique about computer science is how it has become a skill, and not just a career. While there are jobs and titles of “computer scientist”, the skill of computer science, and specifically programming, are almost everywhere. After reading and using this book, you'll have the essential skills to think like a computer scientist, even if you are not. As a result you’ll be of greater value to your clients, your company, and yourself.  \n\nWhat You Will Learn\n\nDiscover the primary building blocks of programming using the Java programming language\nSee terminology and best practices of software development\nWork with object-oriented programming concepts\nUse common-language definitions and examples to help drive understanding and comprehension of computer science fundamentals\n\nWho This Book Is For\n\nThose who want to learn programming and want to think like a computer scientist.

Coyner"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"March 2003","description":"Extreme Programming does not mean programming naked while rollerblading down the side of the Grand Canyon. It does mean a new approach to software development that is both radical and common-sense. Unlike many software development methodologies, XP has been accepted quickly because its core practices--particularly code sharing, test-first development, and continuous integration--resonated immediately with software developers everywhere. Instead of impressing developers with a body of theory, XP got programmers to say, \"Yeah, that's how I'd like to work.\" Oddly enough, although most developers turn to Extreme Programming methods in order to code real, hands-on, and extensible projects quickly (\"Code comes first\"), most books on Extreme Programming insist on focusing on the theory and not the practice. Not the Java Extreme Programming Cookbook. Brimming with over 100 \"recipes\" for getting down to business and actually doing XP, the Java Extreme Programming Cookbook doesn't try to \"sell\" you on XP; it succinctly documents the most important features of popular open source tools for XP in Java--including Ant, Junit, HttpUnit, Cactus, Tomcat, XDoclet--and then digs right in, providing recipes for implementing the tools in real-world environments. Each recipe offers solutions that help you put an extreme programming environment together: then provides code for automating the build process and testing. Although the time saved using any one of these solutions will more than pay for the book, Java Extreme Programming Cookbook offers more than just a collection of cut-and-paste code. Each recipe also includes explanations of how and why the approach works, so you can adapt the techniques to similar situations. One of the biggest challenges facing developers today is sorting through the wide variety of tools available form various source and figuring out how to them effectively. The recipes in Java Extreme Programming Cookbook showcase how to use the most important features of these XP tools. Many of these tools are geared towards unit testing, while others are invaluable for continuous integration; with these practical examples, you'll be able to choose the most effective tools to accomplish your goals, then implement them in a cohesive development environment quickly. If you want to set up a test-driven development environment that allows you to focus on writing testable code--now--this book will prove invaluable.","tags":["Software Development","Programming Languages","JVM Languages","Java"]},{"id":"9781784392789","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Gradle Dependency Management","authors":["Hubert Klein Ikkink"],"pages":"188","publication_date":"June 2015","description":"Gradle Dependency Management is your essential guide to mastering dependency handling in Gradle for Java projects.

Java provides many different kinds of streams, each with its own application. The universe of streams is divided into four large categories: input streams and output streams, for reading and writing binary data; and readers and writers, for reading and writing textual (character) data. You're almost certainly familiar with the basic kinds of streams--but did you know that there's a CipherInputStream for reading encrypted data? And a ZipOutputStream for automatically compressing data? Do you know how to use buffered streams effectively to make your I/O operations more efficient? Java I/O tells you all you ever need to know about streams--and probably more. A discussion of I/O wouldn't be complete without treatment of character sets and formatting. Java supports the UNICODE standard, which provides definitions for the character sets of most written languages. Consequently, Java is the first programming language that lets you do I/O in virtually any language. Java also provides a sophisticated model for formatting textual and numeric data. Java I/O shows you how to control number formatting, use characters aside from the standard (but outdated) ASCII character set, and get a head start on writing truly multilingual software.

Until recently, however, implementing the patterns in that classic reference required the extensive use of raw Java code. Now there’s a better alternative: Using Sun’s Java Composite Application Suite (Java CAPS), architects and developers can implement enterprise integration patterns succinctly, elegantly, and completely. In Java™ CAPS Basics, Sun’s own Java CAPS experts show how to quickly put these new tools and technologies to work in your real-world enterprise application integration projects. After reviewing the challenges of enterprise integration, they introduce Java CAPS and show how it can simplify the development of today’s state-of-the-art “composite” applications. Next, they bridge the gap between abstract pattern languages and practical implementation details. You will learn essential Java CAPS concepts and methods in the context of the patterns you’ll actually use for real-world message and system management.

Developers who used to spend hours and hours writing low-level features have realized the enormous benefits of using well-written frameworks to build the presentation tier so they can get to coding the \"good stuff\", the business logic at the core of the program. The Struts Framework, originally created by Craig R. McClanahan and donated to the Apache Software Foundation's Jakarta project in 2000, has become one of the most popular presentation frameworks for building web applications with Java Servlet and JavaServer Pages (JSP) technology. It encourages application architecture based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design paradigm, colloquially known as the Model 2 approach. As popular as Struts is becoming, the online documentation is inadequate, focusing on the most basic functionality and leaving out information crucial to developers writing today's complex web applications. O'Reilly's Programming Jakarta Struts was written by Chuck Cavaness after his internet company decided to adopt the framework, then spent months really figuring out how to use it to its fullest potential. He calls the books, \"the culmination of lessons learned (the hard way) during the building of our application.\" Readers will benefit from the real-world, \"this is how to do it\" approach Cavaness takes to developing complex enterprise applications using Struts, and his focus on the 1.1 version of the Framework makes this the most up-to-date book available. Programming Jakarta Struts covers:\n\nAn overview of the concepts involved in writing web applications\n\nDetailed installation and configuration instructions to get Struts up and running quickly\n\nA thorough discussion of how Struts implements the Model-View-Controller pattern, and how to interface with that pattern in your own applications\n\nJSP and Jakarta Tag Libraries for authoring complex web pages\n\nLogging, Validation, and Exception Handling with Struts\n\nUsing the new Struts template framework, Tiles.\n\nWriting internationalization and localization code using Struts\n\nPractical, real-world best practices for web applications\n\nCraig McClanahan, originator of Struts, says of the book, \"One thing a lot of open source packages lack is a comprehensive guide to all of the features -- something that goes far enough past \"hello, world\" to get you into solving real application design problems, and it looks like you've hit just the right level for a lot of people.\"","tags":["Software Development","Programming Languages","JVM Languages","Java","Struts"]},{"id":"9781430207399","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Decompiling Java","authors":["Godfrey Nolan"],"pages":"280","publication_date":"July 2004","description":"Both Java and .NET use the idea of a \"virtual machine,\" or VM.

Its advantages are clear: web services are platform-independent (like Java itself), language-agnostic (a clear advantage over Java RMI), can easily be tunneled through firewalls (an obvious benefit to anyone who has dealt with modern enterprise networks), object-oriented (we all know about that), and tends to be loosely coupled (allowing more flexible application development). But these advantages have been obscured by a cloud of hype and a proliferation of jargon that are difficult to penetrate. What are SOAP, UDDI, WSDL, and JAXM? To say nothing of JAXR, tModels, category bags, WSFL, and other friends? And assuming that you understand what they are, how do you do anything with them? Do they live up to their promises? Are they really the future of network computing, or a dead end? Java Web Services gives the experienced Java developer a way into the Web Services world. It helps you to understand what's going on, what the technologies mean and how they relate, and shows Java developers how to put them to use to solve real problems. You'll learn what's real and what isn't; what the technologies are really supposed to do, and how they do it. Java Web Services shows you how to use SOAP to perform remote method calls and message passing; how to use WSDL to describe the interface to a web service or understand the interface of someone else's service; and how to use UDDI to advertise (publish) and look up services in each local or global registry. Java Web Services also discusses security issues, interoperability issues, integration with other Java enterprise technologies like EJB; the work being done on the JAXM and JAX-RPC packages, and integration with Microsoft's .NET services. The web services picture is still taking shape; there are many platforms and APIs to consider, and many conflicting claims from different marketing groups. And although web services are inherently language-independent, the fit between the fundamental principles on which Java and web services are based means that Java will almost certainly be the predominant language for web services development.

As the first language designed from the bottom up with networking in mind, Java makes it very easy for computers to cooperate. Even the simplest applet running in a browser is a distributed application, if you think about it. The client running the browser downloads and executes code that is delivered by some other system. But even this simple applet wouldn't be possible without Java's guarantees of portability and security: the applet can run on any platform, and can't sabotage its host.Of course, when we think of distributed computing, we usually think of applications more complex than a client and server communicating with the same protocol. We usually think in terms of programs that make remote procedure calls, access remote databases, and collaborate with others to produce a single result. Java Distributed Computing discusses how to design and write such applications. It covers Java's RMI (Remote Method Invocation) facility and CORBA, but it doesn't stop there; it tells you how to design your own protocols to build message passing systems and discusses how to use Java's security facilities, how to write multithreaded servers, and more.

You can alter the services to make J2EE work the way you want, or even throw J2EE away completely.\n\nAfter more than a million downloads, many JBoss users are no longer trying it out on internal test boxes, but rolling it out on production machines. JBoss: A Developer's Notebook takes you on a complete tour of JBoss in a very unique way: rather than long discussions, you will find code--lots of code. In fact, the book is a collection of hands-on labs that take you through the critical JBoss features step-by-step. You don't just read about JBoss, you learn it through direct practical application. That includes exploring the server's many configurations: from bare features for simple applications, to the lightweight J2EE configuration, to everything JBoss has in store-including Hibernate and Tomcat.\n\nJBoss: A Developer's Notebook also introduces the management console, the web services messaging features, enhanced monitoring capabilities, and shows you how to improve performance. At the end of each lab, you'll find a section called \"What about...\" that anticipates and answers likely follow-up questions, along with a section that points you to articles and other resources if you need more information.\n\nJBoss is truly an extraordinary application server. And we have an extraordinary way for you to learn it.","tags":["Software Development","Programming Languages","JVM Languages","Java","Jakarta EE","JBoss"]},{"id":"9781484225981","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Kubernetes Management Design Patterns: With Docker, CoreOS Linux, and Other Platforms","authors":["Deepak Vohra"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"January 2017","description":"Take container cluster management to the next level; learn how to administer and configure Kubernetes on CoreOS; and apply suitable management design patterns such as Configmaps, Autoscaling, elastic resource usage, and high availability. Some of the other features discussed are logging, scheduling, rolling updates, volumes, service types, and multiple cloud provider zones. The atomic unit of modular container service in Kubernetes is a Pod, which is a group of containers with a common filesystem and networking. The Kubernetes Pod abstraction enables design patterns for containerized applications similar to object-oriented design patterns. Containers provide some of the same benefits as software objects such as modularity or packaging, abstraction, and reuse.\n\nCoreOS Linux is used in the majority of the chapters and other platforms discussed are CentOS with OpenShift, Debian 8 (jessie) on AWS, and Debian 7 for Google Container Engine.\n\nCoreOS is the main focus becayse Docker is pre-installed on CoreOS out-of-the-box.

However, because this technology is based on Java, you should first obtain a solid grasp of the Java language and its foundational APIs to improve your chances of succeeding as an Android app developer. After all, you will be busy learning the architecture of an Android app, the various Android-specific APIs, and Android-specific tools. If you do not already know Java fundamentals, you will probably end up with a massive headache from also having to quickly cram those fundamentals into your knowledge base.\n\nLearn Java for Android Development, Second Edition teaches programmers of any skill level the essential Java language and foundational Java API skills that must be learned to improve the programmer's chances of succeeding as an Android app developer. Each of the book's 14 chapters provides an exercise section that gives you the opportunity to reinforce your understanding of the chapter's material. Answers to the book's more than 500 exercises are provided in an appendix. A second appendix provides a significant game-oriented Java application, which you can convert into an Android app.\n\nOnce you complete this book, you should be ready to dive into beginning Android app development. Maybe, start that journey with Apress' Beginning Android.\n\nWhat you'll learn\n\nThe Java language: This book provides complete coverage of nearly every pre-Java version 7 language feature (native methods are briefly mentioned but not formally covered). Starting with basic language features (e.g., comments, types, expressions, and statements), you progress to those features related to classes and objects, followed by object-oriented features related to inheritance, polymorphism, and interfaces. You then explore the advanced language features for nested types, packages, static imports, exceptions, assertions, annotations, generics, and enums. Continuing, you investigate strictfp, synchronized, volatile, the enhanced for loop statement, autoboxing/unboxing, and transient fields.\n\nJava APIs: In addition to Object and APIs related to exceptions, you explore Math, StrictMath, BigDecimal, BigInteger, String, StringBuffer/StringBuilder, Boolean, Character, Byte, Short, Integer, Long, Float, Double, Number, the Threads API, System, Runtime, Process, the Collections Framework, the Concurrency Utilities, Date, Formatter, Random, Scanner, the ZIP and JAR APIs, File, RandomAccessFile, stream classes, and writer/reader classes, InetAddress, SocketOptions, Socket, ServerSocket, DatagramSocket, MulticastSocket, URL, URLConnection, URLEncoder, URLDecoder, NetWorkInterface, InterfaceAddress, CookieHandler, CookieManager, CookieStore, CookiePolicy, Buffer, ByteBuffer, CharBuffer, DoubleBuffer,FloatBuffer, IntBuffer, LongBuffer, ShortBuffer, MappedByteBuffer, Channel, WritableByteChannel, ReadableByteChannel,ScatteringByteChannel, GatheringByteChannel, FileChannel, the Regular Expressions API, JDBC, and more.\n\nApplying these: You will learn how to use the JDK's javac (compiler), java (application launcher), javadoc (Java documentation generator), and jar (Java archive creator, updater, and extractor) tools. You will also receive an introduction to the Eclipse integrated development environment, which is the official standard for developing Android apps.\n\nWho this book is for\n\nThis book is for any programmer - including existing Java programmers and Objective-C-based iPhone and iPad programmers - of any skill level who needs to obtain a solid understanding of the Java language and foundational Java APIs before jumping into Android app development.","tags":["Software Development","Programming Languages","JVM Languages","Java"]},{"id":"9780137043699","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"WebSphere Application Server Administration Using Jython","authors":["Robert A.

Since Java Enterprise in a Nutshell was first published in September of 1999, a dozen or more new APIs have been added to the platform, reflecting the new and different ways developers implement their enterprise objectives. And now developers are being called on to add even greater, more complex levels of interconnectivity to their applications, as the concepts behind Web Services solidify and implementation decisions need coding. Java developers today need a clear understanding of the new APIs, tools, capabilities and pitfalls in J2EE 2.0 so they can plan a technology and implementation strategy for new enterprise projects. Fortunately, this is exactly what they get with the new Java Enterprise in a Nutshell, 2nd edition! Completely revised and updated for the new 2.0 version of Sun Microsystems Java Enterprise Edition software, Java Enterprise in a Nutshell 2nd edition covers all of the J2EE APIs, including RMI, Java IDL, JDBC, JNDI, Java Servlet, and Enterprise JavaBeans, with a fast-paced tutorial and compact reference on each technology. Then Java Enterprise in a Nutshell goes even further, providing a classic O'Reilly-style quick reference for all of the classes in the various packages that comprise the Enterprise APIs - covering the core enterprise APIs as well as numerous standard extensions.","tags":["Software Development","Programming Languages","JVM Languages","Java"]},{"id":"0131118269","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Core Java™ 2 Volume II - Advanced Features, Seventh Edition","authors":["Cay S.

SQLJ takes you further, allowing you to access a database using embedded SQL statements. Java Programming with Oracle SQLJ shows you how to get the most out of SQLJ. Layered on top of JDBC, SQLJ greatly simplifies database programming. Rather than make several calls to the JDBC API just to execute a simple SQL statement, SQLJ executes that statement simply by embedding it within the Java code. In this book, Jason Price explains SQLJ programming from a task-oriented point of view. You'll learn how to:\n\nEmbed queries and other SQL statements within Java programs\n\nDeploy SQLJ code not only on client machines, but also to JServer--Oracle's Java engine built into the database\n\nUse advanced techniques for working with collections, streams, large objects, and database objects, all without leaving the comfort of the SQLJ environment\n\nTune SQLJ programs for maximum performance\n\nThroughout the book, the exposition of SQLJ and SQLJ programming techniques reflects the author's many years of professional experience as a programmer and consultant.

This one-of-a kind book is a complete treatment of the JMX architecture (both the instrumentation level and the agent level), and it's loaded with real-world examples for implementing Management Extensions.

This book takes developers through it step by step, pointing out the \"gotchas\" before they have a chance to trip up smooth operation of the application. The author, a member of the expert group developing the JMX specification, points out that as J2EE becomes more widely adopted, the Java standard for management (JMX) becomes more and more crucial to avoid \"splinter standards\" where each vendor has their own distinct, arguably successful, way of doing things. \"In my own company we have already identified and are tackling the problem of managing our Java applications.

Many Enterprise Java developers, accustomed to dealing with Java's spiraling complexity, have fallen into the habit of choosing overly complicated solutions to problems when simpler options are available. Building server applications with \"heavyweight\" Java-based architectures, such as WebLogic, JBoss, and WebSphere, can be costly and cumbersome. When you've reached the point where you spend more time writing code to support your chosen framework than to solve your actual problems, it's time to think in terms of simplicity.In Better, Faster, Lighter Java, authors Bruce Tate and Justin Gehtland argue that the old heavyweight architectures are unwieldy, complicated, and contribute to slow and buggy application code. As an alternative means for building better applications, the authors present two \"lightweight\" open source architectures: Hibernate--a persistence framework that does its job with a minimal API and gets out of the way, and Spring--a container that's not invasive, heavy or complicated.Hibernate and Spring are designed to be fairly simple to learn and use, and place reasonable demands on system resources. Better, Faster, Lighter Java shows you how they can help you create enterprise applications that are easier to maintain, write, and debug, and are ultimately much faster.Written for intermediate to advanced Java developers, Better, Faster, Lighter Java, offers fresh ideas--often unorthodox--to help you rethink the way you work, and techniques and principles you'll use to build simpler applications.

How do you build the back end so that it not only handles your current needs but is flexible enough to allow your system to evolve as your needs expand? Answer these questions and many more with Building Java Enterprise Applications, an advanced guide to building complex Java Enterprise Applications from the ground up that addresses design issues along the way. These practical books take a step back from detailed examination of the APIs and focus on the entire picture, so you can put the pieces together and build something that works! This book explores the infrastructure issues so important to good application design. It isn't just a book about doing things with Entity Beans, JDBC and JMS and JNDI. It takes you step by step through building the back end, designing the data store so that it gives you convenient access to the data your application needs; designing a directory; figuring out how to handle security and where to store security credentials you need; and so on. On top of this, it shows -- as easily as possible --how to build the entity bean layer that makes information available to the rest of the application. Throughout this guide, author Brett McLaughlin uses his wealth of real-world experience with enterprise development to show you one step at a time how to design and build a comprehensive enterprise application from the ground up, starting with the back end.","tags":["Software Development","Programming Languages","JVM Languages","Java"]},{"id":"9781449332082","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Continuous Enterprise Development in Java","authors":["Andrew Lee Rubinger","Aslak Knutsen"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"March 2014","description":"Learn a use-case approach for developing Java enterprise applications in a continuously test-driven fashion.

JDO allows you to store and retrieve objects in a way that's natural to Java programmers. Instead of working with JDBC or EJB's container-managed persistence, you work directly with your Java objects. You don't have to copy data to and from database tables or issue SELECTs to perform queries: your JDO implementation takes care of persistence behind-the-scenes, and you make queries based on the fields of your Java objects, using normal Java syntax.\n\nThe result is software that is truly object-oriented: not code that is partially object-oriented, with a large database-shaped lump on the back end. JDO lets you save plain, ordinary Java objects, and does not force you to use different data models and types for dealing with storage. As a result, your code becomes easier to maintain, easier to re-use, and easier to test. And you're not tied to a specific database vendor: your JDO code is entirely database-independent. You don't even need to know whether the datastore is a relational database, an object database, or just a set of files.\n\nThis book, written by the JDO Specification Lead and one of the key contributors to the JDO Specification, is the definitive work on the JDO API. It gives you a thorough introduction to JDO, starting with a simple application that demonstrates many of JDO's capabilities. It shows you how to make classes persistent, how JDO maps persistent classes to the database, how to configure JDO at runtime, how to perform transactions, and how to make queries. More advanced chapters cover optional features such as nontransactional access and optimistic transactions. The book concludes by discussing the use of JDO in web applications and J2EE environments.\n\nWhether you only want to read up on an interesting new technology, or are seriously considering an alternative to JDBC or EJB CMP, you'll find that this book is essential. It provides by far the most authoritative and complete coverage available.","tags":["Software Development","Programming Languages","JVM Languages","Java"]},{"id":"0596002319","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"JavaServer Pages Pocket Reference","authors":["Hans Bergsten"],"pages":"88","publication_date":"July 2001","description":"JavaServer Pages (JSP) is harmonizing how web designers and programmers create dynamic web pages.

However, because this technology is based on Java, you should first obtain a solid grasp of the Java language and its foundational APIs to improve your chances of succeeding as an Android app developer. After all, you will be busy learning the architecture of an Android app, the various Android-specific APIs, and Android-specific tools. If you do not already know Java fundamentals, you will probably end up with a massive headache from also having to quickly cram those fundamentals into your knowledge base.\n\nLearn Java for Android Development teaches programmers of any skill level the essential Java language and foundational Java API skills that must be learned to improve the programmer's chances of succeeding as an Android app developer. Each of the book's 10 chapters provides an exercise section that gives you the opportunity to reinforce your understanding of the chapter's material. Answers to the book's more than 300 exercises are provided in an appendix. Additionally, author Jeff Friesen has created six bonus chapters that you can download from his personal site, located at http://tutortutor.ca/cgi-bin/makepage.cgi?/books/ljfad.\n\nOnce you complete this book, you will be ready to dive into Android, and you can start that journey by obtaining a copy of Beginning Android 2.\n\nWhat you'll learn\n\nThe Java language: This book provides complete coverage of nearly every pre-Java version 7 language feature (native methods are briefly mentioned but not formally covered). Starting with those features related to classes and objects, you progress to object-oriented features related to inheritance, polymorphism, and interfaces. You then explore the advanced language features for nested types, packages, static imports, exceptions, assertions, annotations, generics, and enums. Continuing, you investigate strictfp, class literals, synchronized, volatile, the enhanced for loop statement, autoboxing/unboxing, and transient fields. The book also briefly presents most (if not all) of Java version 7's language features, although not much is said about closures or modules (which were not finalized at the time of writing).\n\nJava APIs: In addition to Object and APIs related to exceptions, you explore Math, StrictMath, BigDecimal, BigInteger, Package, Boolean, Character, Byte, Short, Integer, Long, Float, Double, Number, the References API, the Reflection API, String, StringBuffer, System, the Threading API, the collections framework, the concurrency utilities, the internationalization APIs, the Preferences API, Random, the Regular Expressions API, File, RandomAccessFile, stream classes, and writer/reader classes. You will also get a tiny taste of Swing in the context of internationalization.\n\nTools: You will learn how to use the JDK's javac (compiler), java (application launcher), javadoc (Java documentation generator), and jar (Java archive creator, updater, and extractor) tools. You will also receive an introduction to the NetBeans and Eclipse integrated development environments. Although you can develop Android apps without NetBeans or Eclipse, working with these IDEs is much more pleasant.\n\nWho this book is for\n\nThis book is for any programmer (including existing Java programmers and Objective-C [iPhone/iPad] programmers) of any skill level who needs to obtain a solid understanding of the Java language and foundational Java APIs before jumping into Android app development.","tags":["Software Development","Programming Languages","JVM Languages","Java"]},{"id":"9780470417973","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"SCJP: Sun Certified Programmer for Java® Platform, SE6, Study Guide","authors":["Richard F.

This book is a succinct introduction and handy reference to the Java/XML APIs, more commonly known as the JWSDP or \"Java Web Services Development Pack.\" These APIs are taking the Java world by storm, as they are capable of handling everything from simple XML to SOAP to full ebXML vocabularies. Although \"web services\" technology has suffered from much hype and overly grand expectations, there is plenty of solid development going on, especially in extending enterprise applications, and a huge amount of this development is being done in Java. As a result, the J2EE APIs for web services are evolving rapidly, and this new \"in a Nutshell\" book covers them all in depth. One of the most important APIs in the JWSDP is JAX-RPC (Java API for XML-based RPC). It's also the API that developers most consistently post questions about. Java Web Services in a Nutshell covers all aspects of JAX-RPC in detail, with tutorial coverage alone exceeding 150 pages. This book offers developers everything they need to program with JAX-RPC. Java Web Services in a Nutshell begins with an introduction to Java web services, including a discussion of how they differ from web applications. The author looks at the protocols and interfaces that underpin web services, the J2EE technologies that address web services, WSDL as the means for describe web services, and more. Subsequent chapters cover:\n\nJAX-RPC\n\nSOAP and the SOAP with Attachments API for Java (SAAJ)\n\nReliable SOAP messaging with JAXM\n\nWSDL\n\nAdvanced JAX-RPC\n\nJAXR, the XML-based registry API\n\nWeb Services Tools\n\nThe balance of the book is made up of an API Quick Reference containing documentation for the various API packages. Intended for Java developers who need to implement Java services or who need their applications to access existing web services, Java Web Services in a Nutshell delivers practical information to help developers make sense of the rapidly changing and poorly organized official documentation.

It discusses the shortcomings of JSF, the challenges of using Java persistence in the web environment, and other common development roadblocks, then shows how Seam makes these problems just melt away. In covering Seam, the author doesn't just ask you to sprinkle annotations on your code and expect that you understand how it works. Instead, the author lays down the facts, shows you the steps, reveals the logic, and diagrams the flow, so that by the end of the book, you will not only have gained a deep understanding of Seam, but will also come away ready to teach the material to others.\n\nAbout the Technology\n\nSeam is an exciting new application framework based on the Java EE platform that you can use to build rich, web-based business applications. Seam is rapidly capturing the interest of Java enterprise developers because of its focus on simplicity, ease of use, transparent integration, scalability, and developer choice.\n\nAbout the Book\n\nAll too often, developers spend a majority of their time integrating disparate technologies, manually tracking state, struggling to understand JSF, wrestling with Hibernate exceptions, and constantly redeploying applications, rather than on the logic pertaining to the business at hand. Seam in Action dives deep into thorough explanations of how Seam eliminates these non-core tasks by leveraging configuration by exception, Java 5 annotations, and aspect-oriented programming.\n\nTo start off, you will see a working Java EE-compliant application come together by the end of the second chapter. As you progress through the book, you will discover how Seam eliminates unnecessary layers and configurations and uses an inversion of control technical known as bijection supplemented by a liberal use of the Unified Expression Language (EL) to establish the missing link between JSF, EJB 3 and JavaBean components. You also witness how Seam opens doors for you to incorporate technologies you previously have not had time to learn, such as business processes and stateful page flows (jBPM), rule-based security, Ajax remoting, PDF generation, Spring integration, and more.\n\nWhat's Inside\nGet started with Seam using seam-gen\nClarifies the inner workings of bijection\nBreaks down all the Seam annotations\nCovers integration with Spring 2.0\nShows how to make your applications rich (and hopefully you too!)\nDepth beyond what is found in the reference documentation\nAbout the ReaderAbout the Author\n\nDan Allen is a passionate enterprise software developer, scholar, and mentor. For Dan, the end game is to be a mentor, and writing is one medium he uses to pursue that goal. Dan has over eight years of development experience using technologies that include Java frameworks (Seam, JSF, EJB3, Hibernate, Spring, Struts), testing frameworks (JUnit, TestNG), JavaScript and DOM scripting, CSS and page layouts, Maven 2, Ant, Groovy, as well as a wealth of other technologies not mentioned. Dan is also a dedicated open source advocate, and is very proud, and not a tad bit shy, about the fact that he has been running Linux, and only Linux, since the turn of the millennium. Dan's professional passions are equally divided between Java and Linux, with a hint of other technologies mixed in.\n\nQuotes\"Seam in Action\" captures the spirit of Seam and shows you how to use it the way we on the Seam team intended.- Norman Richards, Red HatOpen this book first!

It offers a component architecture for developing distributed, multitiered enterprise applications. This model allows you to build complex, mission-critical systems using simple snap-together pieces that model individual business objects and processes. Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) greatly simplifies the process of development by automatically taking care of system issues like object persistence and transaction management. This book provides a thorough introduction to EJB 1.1 and 1.0 for the enterprise software developer. It shows you how to develop enterprise Beans to model your business objects and processes. One powerful advantage of the EJB architecture is that it allows you to partition work appropriately between different parts of the system: the database provides persistence, your Beans model various business entities and the interactions between them, and your client application provides a user interface, but incorporates minimal business logic. The end result is a highly flexible system built from components that can easily be reused, and that can be changed to suit your needs without upsetting other parts of the system. Enterprise JavaBeans, 2nd Edition teaches you how to take advantage of the flexibility and simplicity that this powerful new architecture provides. This book covers:\n\nEnterprise JavaBeans 1.1 and 1.0\n\nDeveloping entity Beans and session Beans\n\nXML Deployment Descriptors\n\nUsing the client-side API to use enterprise Beans\n\nTransaction Management\n\nDesign Strategies\n\nIntroduction to J2EE","tags":["Software Development","Programming Languages","JVM Languages","Java","Jakarta EE","Jakarta Enterprise Beans"]},{"id":"059600530X","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Enterprise JavaBeans, Fourth Edition","authors":["Sacha Labourey","Bill Burke","Richard Monson-Haefel"],"pages":"792","publication_date":"June 2004","description":"The new 2.1 version of the Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) spec extends its support for web services and the Java Web Services APIs, expands its asynchronous messaging support, adds XML Schema for deployment descriptors, and introduces a new Timer service, which allows for scheduling EJB jobs. The essential--and award winning--book on EJBs, Enterprise JavaBeans, has been completely revised and updated in this new fourth edition, to provide the real-world, nitty-gritty detail developers need to master EJB 2.1. Previous editions of this clear and engaging introduction to EJBs were voted the \"Best Java Book\" by the editors and readers of Java Developer's Journal, the \"Best Java Book for Experts,\" by JavaPro editors, and one of the Top Computer Books by Amazon.com. The fourth edition lives up to--and surpasses--the excellent reputation earned by its predecessors. This authoritative and thorough guide includes everything that made previous editions the single must-have book for EJB developers: the authors solid grasp on the complexities of EJBs coupled with his succinct, easy-to-follow style; hundreds of clear, practical examples; adept coverage the key concepts EJBs ; and diagrams to illustrate the concepts presented. It also includes everything you need to get up to speed quickly on the changes wrought by EJB version 2.1, an architecture overview, information on resource management and primary services, design strategies, and XML deployment descriptors. In this edition, we're adding an EJB workbook for JBoss 4.0. The workbook shows how to deploy all of the examples on the JBoss 4.0 application server. It addresses an important problem with EJB: deploying the software on a server can be extremely difficult. JBoss is an open source project that has become the most widely used J2EE application server. Good technical authors may lay the facts before you, but great ones offer the distilled essence of their own experience and insight. Richard Monson-Haefel has provided just what Java developers need to know to harness the complexity of EJBs. What makes Monson-Haefel a master of technical authoring can be seen in his well-thought-out and logical progression of ideas, and in his examples practical, precise, usable examples, large enough to test key concepts but still small enough to be comprehensible taken apart and explained in the detail you need to deploy those principles in other situations. If you work with EJBs--or want to--this book will earn a favored spot on your bookshelf.","tags":["Software Development","Programming Languages","JVM Languages","Java","Jakarta EE","Jakarta Enterprise Beans"]},{"id":"9781492048343","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"RxJava for Android App Development","authors":["K.

It lays out a clear approach that uses the mechanisms of the private market to hold corporations accountable to the public. This would happen through the creation of what the authors call the Universal Fund, a kind of national, democratic, mega mutual fund. Every American over eighteen would be entitled to a share and would participate in directing its share voting choices. Corporations and wealthy individuals would donate stocks, bonds, cash, or other assets to the fund just like they do to other philanthropic ventures now. The fund would pay out dividends to its citizen-shareholders that would grow as the fund grows. The Universal Fund is undoubtedly a big idea, but it is also eminently practical: it uses the tools of capitalism, not government, to give all citizens a direct influence on corporate actions. It would be a major institutional investor beholden not to a small elite group of stockholders pushing for short-term gain but to everyone. The fund would reward corporations that made sure their actions didn't harm people, communities, and the environment, and it would enable them to invest in innovations that would take more than a few months to pay off. Which is another reason corporations would donate to the fund—they could be freed from the constant pressure to maximize their quarterly share price and would essentially be subsidized for doing good. The authors demonstrate that our current economic rules force corporations to be shortsighted and even destructive because for most large investors, nothing matters but share price. The Universal Fund is designed to be a powerful positive balancing force, making the world a better place and the United States a better nation.","tags":["Software Development","Programming Languages","JVM Languages","Java","Spring"]},{"id":"0672319586","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Sams Teach Yourself Java 2 in 21 Days, Second Edition","authors":["Laura Lemay","Rogers Cadenhead"],"pages":"672","publication_date":"September 2000","description":"Sams Teach Yourself Java in 21 Days, Second Edition is known for its clear and personable writing, its extensive use of examples, and its logical step-by-step organization.

When minimal configuration is required to start up an application, even novice Java developers are ready to start. But this simplicity shouldn't constrain developers in addressing more complex enterprise requirements where microservice architecture is concerned. With the need to rapidly deploy, patch, or scale applications, containers provide solutions which can accelerate development, testing as well as production cycles. The cloud helps companies to scale and adapt at speed, accelerate innovation and drive business agility, without heavy upfront IT investment. What if we can equip even a novice developer with all that is required to help enterprises achieve all of this, this book does this and more.\n\nJava Microservices and Containers in the Cloud offers a comprehensive guide to both architecture and programming aspects to Java microservices development, providing a fully hands-on experience. We not only describe various architecture patterns but also provide practical implementations of each pattern through code examples.

You might think the problem is your brain. It seems to have a mind of its own, a mind that doesn't always want to take in the dry, technical stuff you're forced to study. The fact is your brain craves novelty. It's constantly searching, scanning, waiting for something unusual to happen. After all, that's the way it was built to help you stay alive. It takes all the routine, ordinary, dull stuff and filters it to the background so it won't interfere with your brain's real work--recording things that matter. How does your brain know what matters? It's like the creators of the Head First approach say, suppose you're out for a hike and a tiger jumps in front of you, what happens in your brain? Neurons fire. Emotions crank up. Chemicals surge. That's how your brain knows.And that's how your brain will learn Java. Head First Java combines puzzles, strong visuals, mysteries, and soul-searching interviews with famous Java objects to engage you in many different ways. It's fast, it's fun, and it's effective. And, despite its playful appearance, Head First Java is serious stuff: a complete introduction to object-oriented programming and Java. You'll learn everything from the fundamentals to advanced topics, including threads, network sockets, and distributed programming with RMI. And the new. second edition focuses on Java 5.0, the latest version of the Java language and development platform. Because Java 5.0 is a major update to the platform, with deep, code-level changes, even more careful study and implementation is required. So learning the Head First way is more important than ever. If you've read a Head First book, you know what to expect--a visually rich format designed for the way your brain works. If you haven't, you're in for a treat. You'll see why people say it's unlike any other Java book you've ever read.By exploiting how your brain works, Head First Java compresses the time it takes to learn and retain--complex information. Its unique approach not only shows you what you need to know about Java syntax, it teaches you to think like a Java programmer. If you want to be bored, buy some other book.

Its emphasis is on modular program construction: how to get the modules right and how to organize a program as a collection of modules. The book presents a methodology effective for either an individual programmer, who may be writing a small program or a single module in a larger one; or a software engineer, who may be part of a team developing a complex program comprised of many modules. Both audiences will acquire a solid foundation for object-oriented program design and component-based software development from this methodology.\n\nBecause each module in a program corresponds to an abstraction, such as a collection of documents or a routine to search the collection for documents of interest, the book first explains the kinds of abstractions most useful to programmers: procedures; iteration abstractions; and, most critically, data abstractions. Indeed, the author treats data abstraction as the central paradigm in object-oriented program design and implementation. The author also shows, with numerous examples, how to develop informal specifications that define these abstractions--specifications that describe what the modules do--and then discusses how to implement the modules so that they do what they are supposed to do with acceptable performance.\n\nOther topics discussed include:\n\nEncapsulation and the need for an implementation to provide the behavior defined by the specification\n\nTradeoffs between simplicity and performance\n\nTechniques to help readers of code understand and reason about it, focusing on such properties as rep invariants and abstraction functions\n\nType hierarchy and its use in defining families of related data abstractions\n\nDebugging, testing, and requirements analysis\n\nProgram design as a top-down, iterative process, and design patterns\n\nThe Java programming language is used for the book's examples.

Significant numbers of poorly designed programs have been created by less-experienced developers, resulting in applications that are inefficient and hard to maintain and extend. Increasingly, software system professionals are discovering just how difficult it is to work with these inherited, \"non-optimal\" applications. For several years, expert-level object programmers have employed a growing collection of techniques to improve the structural integrity and performance of such existing software programs. Referred to as \"refactoring,\" these practices have remained in the domain of experts because no attempt has been made to transcribe the lore into a form that all developers could use. . .until now. In Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code, renowned object technology mentor Martin Fowler breaks new ground, demystifying these master practices and demonstrating how software practitioners can realize the significant benefits of this new process.\n\nWith proper training a skilled system designer can take a bad design and rework it into well-designed, robust code. In this book, Martin Fowler shows you where opportunities for refactoring typically can be found, and how to go about reworking a bad design into a good one. Each refactoring step is simple--seemingly too simple to be worth doing. Refactoring may involve moving a field from one class to another, or pulling some code out of a method to turn it into its own method, or even pushing some code up or down a hierarchy. While these individual steps may seem elementary, the cumulative effect of such small changes can radically improve the design. Refactoring is a proven way to prevent software decay.\n\nIn addition to discussing the various techniques of refactoring, the author provides a detailed catalog of more than seventy proven refactorings with helpful pointers that teach you when to apply them; step-by-step instructions for applying each refactoring; and an example illustrating how the refactoring works. The illustrative examples are written in Java, but the ideas are applicable to any object-oriented programming language.","tags":["Software Development","Programming Languages","JVM Languages","Java"]},{"id":"9781119620778","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Key Performance Indicators, 4th Edition","authors":["David Parmenter"],"pages":"384","publication_date":"October 2019","description":"The new edition of the bestselling guide on creating and using key performance indicators—offers significant new and revised content\n\nKey Performance Indicators (KPIs) help define and measure the organizational goals which are fundamental to an organization’s current and future success.

In the first stage, they learn the language itself. In the second stage, they study the APIs. In the third stage, they become proficient in the environment. It is in the fourth stage --\"the expert stage\"-- where things really get interesting, and Java Enterprise Best Practices is the tangible compendium of experience that developers need to breeze through this fourth and final stage of Enterprise Java mastery.Crammed with tips and tricks, Java Enterprise Best Practices distills years of solid experience from eleven experts in the J2EE environment into a practical, to-the-point guide to J2EE.Java Enterprise Best Practices gives developers the unvarnished, expert-tested advice that the man pages don't provide--what areas of the APIs should be used frequently (and which are better avoided); elegant solutions to problems you face that other developers have already discovered; what things you should always do, what things you should consider doing, and what things you should never do--even if the documentation says it's ok.Until Java Enterprise Best Practices, Java developers in the fourth stage of mastery relied on the advice of a loose-knit community of fellow developers, time-consuming online searches for examples or suggestions for the immediate problem they faced, and tedious trial-and-error.

You need this book: an accessible introduction to Clojure that focuses on the ideas behind the language as well as the practical details of writing code.\n\nClojure attracts developers on the cutting edge and is arguably the best language for learning to program in the functional style without compromise. But this comes with a steep learning curve. Getting Clojure directly addresses this by teaching you how to think functionally as it teaches you the language. You'll learn about Clojure's powerful data structures and high-level functions, but you'll also learn what it means for a language to be functional, and how to think in Clojure's functional way.\n\nEach chapter of Getting Clojure takes a feature or two or three from the language, explains the syntax and the mechanics behind that feature so that you can make it work before digging into the deeper questions: What is the thinking behind the feature? And how does it fit in with the rest of the language? In Getting Clojure you'll learn Clojure's very simple syntax, but you'll also learn why that syntax is integral the way the language is constructed. You'll discover that most data structures in Clojure are immutable, but also why that leads to more reliable programs. And you'll see how easy it is to write Clojure functions and also how you can use those functions to build complex and capable systems.\n\nWith real-world examples of how working Clojure programmers use the language, Getting Clojure will help you see the challenges of programming through the eye of experienced Clojure developers.\n\nWhat You Need:\n\nYou will need to some background in programming.

Use Scala and Clojure to solve in-depth problems with two sets of patterns: object-oriented patterns that become more concise with functional programming, and natively functional patterns. Your code will be more declarative, with fewer bugs and lower maintenance costs.Functional languages have their own patterns that enable you to solve problems with less code than object-oriented programming alone. This book introduces you, the experienced Java programmer, to Scala and Clojure: practical, production-quality languages that run on the JVM and interoperate with existing Java. By using both the statically typed, type-inferred Scala and the dynamically typed, modern Lisp Clojure, you'll gain a broad understanding of functional programming.For each pattern, you'll first see the traditional object-oriented solution, and then dig into the functional replacements in both Scala and Clojure. These patterns are common in the functional world and deserve to become part of your problem-solving toolkit. On the object-oriented side, you'll see many common patterns, such as Command, Strategy, and Null Object. On the functional side, you'll learn core functional patterns such as Memoization, Lazy Sequence, and Tail Recursion.Each pattern helps you solve a common programming problem. Working through them gives you a set of patterns you can use to solve problems you come across while writing programs. Finally, you'll learn how to work your existing Java code into new Scala or Clojure projects. You can start off small, adding functional code little by little, so you can complement your existing knowledge with Scala and Clojure as these languages gain popularity on the JVM.","tags":["Software Development","Programming Languages","JVM Languages","Scala"]},{"id":"0596006519","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Programming Jakarta Struts, Second Edition","authors":["Chuck Cavaness"],"pages":"480","publication_date":"June 2004","description":"While the look and feel of an enterprise web application is certainly important, developers usually find themselves spending far too much time on the front-end presentation before they can get to coding the good stuff--the business logic at the heart of the program. Jakarta Struts addresses this issue by combining Java Servlets, Java ServerPages (JSP), custom tags, and messaging resources (like Java Message Service) into a unified, re-usable framework. The result is a cooperative, synergistic platform that's efficient and suitable for independent developers, large development teams, and everyone in between. The Struts Framework has become a highly popular open source project, but there's still woefully little documentation on the technology. What does exist is far too basic and lacks critical information for developers like you writing today's complex web applications. The revised and expanded Programming Jakarta Struts, 2nd Edition covers everything the successful earlier edition did--including an overview of the concepts involved in writing web applications; installation and configuration instructions for getting Struts up and running; a thorough discussion of how Struts implements the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design paradigm (known as the Model 2 approach) and how to interface with that pattern in your own applications; Logging, Validation, and Exception Handling with Struts; using Tiles; writing internationalization and localization code using Struts; and practical, real-world best practices for web applications--as well as plenty more: now fully up to date with Struts 1.1, this edition covers the latest material on tag libraries and the new JavaServerFaces (JSF) APIs and even includes all-new chapters on JSF, JSTL/EL, and security.

Fortunately, Spring Boot and Spring Cloud simplify your microservice applications, just as the Spring Framework simplifies enterprise Java development. Spring Boot removes the boilerplate code involved with writing a REST-based service. Spring Cloud provides a suite of tools for the discovery, routing, and deployment of microservices to the enterprise and the cloud.\n\nAbout the Book\n\nSpring Microservices in Action teaches you how to build microservice-based applications using Java and the Spring platform. You'll learn to do microservice design as you build and deploy your first Spring Cloud application. Throughout the book, carefully selected real-life examples expose microservice-based patterns for configuring, routing, scaling, and deploying your services. You'll see how Spring's intuitive tooling can help augment and refactor existing applications with microservices.\n\nWhat's Inside\n\nCore microservice design principles\nManaging configuration with Spring Cloud Config\nClient-side resiliency with Spring, Hystrix, and Ribbon\nIntelligent routing using Netflix Zuul\nDeploying Spring Cloud applications\nAbout the Reader\n\nThis book is written for developers with Java and Spring experience.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nJohn Carnell is a senior cloud engineer with twenty years of experience in Java.\n\nQuotesSpring is fast becoming the framework for microservices-this book shows you why and how.- John Guthrie, Dell/EMCA complete real-world bible for any microservices project in Spring.- Mirko Bernardoni, IxxusThorough and practical...with all the special capabilities of Spring thrown in.- Vipul Gupta, SAPLearn how to tame complex and distributed system design.

But despite widespread support, threads tend to be something that everyone talks about, but few use. Programming with threads has a reputation for being tricky and nonportable. Not so with Java. Java's thread facilities are easy to use, and--like everything else in Java--are completely portable between platforms. And that's a good thing, because it's impossible to write anything but the simplest applet without encountering threads. If you want to work with Java, you have to learn about threads. This new edition shows you how to take full advantage of Java's thread facilities: where to use threads to increase efficiency, how to use them effectively, and how to avoid common mistakes. Java Threads discusses problems like deadlock, race condition, and starvation in detail, helping you to write code without hidden bugs. It brings you up to date with the latest changes in the thread interface for JDK 1.2. The book offers a thorough discussion of the Thread and ThreadGroup classes, the Runnable interface, the language's synchronized operator. It explains thread scheduling ends by developing a CPUSchedule class, showing you how to implement your own scheduling policy. In addition, Java Threads shows you how to extend Java's thread primitives. Other extended examples include classes that implement reader/writer locks, general locks, locks at arbitrary scope, and asynchronous I/O. This edition also adds extensive examples on thread pools, advanced synchronization technique, like condition variables, barriers, and daemon locks. It shows how to work with classes that are not thread safe, and pays special attention to threading issues with Swing. A new chapter shows you how to write parallel code for multiprocessor machines. In short, Java Threads covers everything you need to know about threads, from the simplest animation applet to the most complex applications.

Of course, it covers the basics: what SOAP is, why it's soared to a spot on the Buzzwords' Top Ten list, and what its features and capabilities are. And it shows you how to work with some of the more common Java APIs in the SOAP world: Apache SOAP and GLUE.In addition to covering the basics such as the structure of a SOAP message, SOAP encoding, and building simple services using RPC and messaging, Java and SOAP covers many topics that are essential to real-world development. Although SOAP has native support for an impressive number of object types, the nature of modern programming means that whatever SOAP gives you is not enough. When do you need to add support for your own object types, and how do you do it? How do you handle errors, and how do you add your own information to Fault messages? How do you handle attachments?In an ideal world, you could live entirely within Java, and ignore the SOAP messages being send back and forth: you'd be able to write Java code and let the SOAP APIs work behind the scenes. However, we're not yet in that ideal world, and won't be for some time. Therefore, Java and SOAP pays particular attention to how SOAP messages are encoded. It doesn't just explain the document types, but shows how the documents are used in practice as they are generated by the different APIs. If you ever have to debug interoperability problems, you'll find that this information is indispensable.We've always found that the best software is written by people who understand what's happening under the hood. SOAP is no different. Let's say you need to write a custom serializer to create a SOAP representation of a structure. How do you know that your encoding is efficient? There's one definitive answer: look at the SOAP documents it produces!Java and SOAP also discusses interoperability between the major SOAP platforms, including Microsoft's .NET, SOAP messaging, SOAP attachments, message routing, and a preview of the forthcoming AXIS APIs and server. If you're a Java developer who would like to start working with SOAP, this is the book you need to get going.","tags":["Software Development","Programming Languages","JVM Languages","Java"]},{"id":"9781492037118","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Building observable systems in Java","authors":["Josh Long","Kenny Bastani"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"February 2018","description":"This lesson is for Java/JVM developers who want to build observable, production-worthy systems.

With Java 5.0, you'll not only find substantial changes in the platform, but to the language itself-something that developers of Java took five years to complete. The main goal of Java 5.0 is to make it easier for you to develop safe, powerful code, but none of these improvements makes Java any easier to learn, even if you've programmed with Java for years. And that means our bestselling hands-on tutorial takes on even greater significance.Learning Java is the most widely sought introduction to the programming language that's changed the way we think about computing. Our updated third edition takes an objective, no-nonsense approach to the new features in Java 5.0, some of which are drastically different from the way things were done in any previous versions. The most essential change is the addition of \"generics\", a feature that allows developers to write, test, and deploy code once, and then reuse the code again and again for different data types. The beauty of generics is that more problems will be caught during development, and Learning Java will show you exactly how it's done.Java 5.0 also adds more than 1,000 new classes to the Java library. That means 1,000 new things you can do without having to program it in yourself. That's a huge change. With our book's practical examples, you'll come up to speed quickly on this and other new features such as loops and threads. The new edition also includes an introduction to Eclipse, the open source IDE that is growing in popularity.

Macros make hard things possible and normal things easy. They can be tricky to use, and this book will help you deftly navigate the terrain. You'll discover how to write straightforward code that avoids duplication and clarifies your intentions. You'll learn how and why to write macros. You'll learn to recognize situations when using a macro would (and wouldn't!) be helpful. And you'll use macros to remove unnecessary code and build new language features.Clojure offers some sharp tools in its toolbox, and one of the sharpest is its macro system. This book will help you write macros using Clojure, and more importantly, recognize when you should be using macros in the first place.The Lisp \"code-as-data\" philosophy gives tremendous advantages to macro authors and users. You can use macros to evaluate code in other contexts, move computations to compile time, and create beautiful API layers. You don't need to wait on the Clojure language itself to add new features, you'll learn how to implement even the lowest-level features as macros. You'll step through representative samples of how to use macros in production libraries and applications, find clear details on how to construct macros, and learn pointers to avoid obstacles that often trip up macro amateurs.Clojure macros are more straightforward to use than metaprogramming features in many other languages, but they're different enough from normal programming to present challenges of their own. Mastering Clojure Macros examines some of these issues, along with alternatives to macros where they exist.By the time you finish this book, you'll be thinking like a macro professional.What You Need:The book examples have been developed under Clojure 1.6.0, although earlier and later versions of Clojure may work as well.

It will help you learn EJB 3 and the JPA quickly and easily. This comprehensive, entirely new EJB 3 book starts with a tour of the EJB 3 landscape. It then moves quickly into core topics like building business logic with session and message-driven beans. You'll find four full chapters on the JPA along with practical code samples, design patterns, performance tuning tips, and best practices for building and deploying scalable applications.\n\nAbout the Technology\n\nEJB 2 is widely used but it comes at a cost—procedural, redundant code. EJB 3 is a different animal. By adopting a POJO programming model and Java 5 annotations, it dramatically simplifies enterprise development. A cool new feature, its Java Persistence API, creates a standard for object-relational mapping. You can use it for any Java application, whether inside or outside the EJB container. With EJB 3 you will create true object-oriented applications that are easy to write, maintain and extend.\n\nAbout the BookWhat's Inside\nDependency Injection and Interceptors\nDomain modeling and persisting entities with the JPA and its query language\nUsing EJB 3 across application tiers and web services\nIntegrating with Spring\nMigrating from EJB 2, JDBC, and other O-R frameworks\nAbout the ReaderAbout the Authors\n\nDebu Panda is a Lead Product Manager of the Oracle Application Server development team, where he drives development of the Java EE container.

Beans is the next generation of Java technology that not only adds features the language lacked, but also lets Java programs interoperate with a number of development environments. The initial release includes a bridge for Microsoft's ActiveX/COM; future releases will include bridges for Netscape's LiveConnect and IBM's OpenDoc. Since it's a \"component architecture\" for Java, Beans can be used in graphical programming environments, like Borland's JBuilder, or IBM's VisualAge for Java. This means that someone can use a graphical tool to connect a lot of Beans together and make an application, without actually writing any Java code -- in fact, without doing any programming at all. Graphical development environments let you configure components by specifying aspects of their visual appearance (like the color or label of a button) in addition to the interactions between components (what happens when you click on a button or select a menu item). One important aspect of Java Beans is that components don't have to be visible. This sounds like a minor distinction, but it's very important: the invisible parts of an application are the parts that do the work. So, for example, in addition to manipulating graphical widgets, like checkboxes and menus, Beans allows you to develop and manipulate components that do database access, perform computations, and so on. You can build entire applications by connecting pre-built components, without writing any code. Developing Java Beans is for people who need to stay up-to-date with the latest developments in programming technology. Minimally, developing Beans means adopting several simple design patterns in your code. However, that's only the beginning. To take full advantage of the Java Beans architecture, you should understand how to write classes that are serializable, use events for communication between classes, know when and how to provide BeanInfo classes that give graphical environments more information about your components, and provide property editors and customizers that let graphical tools work with more complex Beans.

It's about the interesting things you learn over the years--creative, original, even weird hacks--the things that make you say, \"I didn't know you could even do that with Swing!\" Swing Hacks will show you how to extend Swing's rich component set in advanced and sometimes non-obvious ways. The book touches upon the entire Swing gamut-tables, trees, sliders, spinners, progress bars, internal frames, and text components. Detail is also provided on JTable/JTree, threaded component models, and translucent windows. You'll learn how to filter lists, power-up trees and tables, and add drag-and-drop support. Swing Hacks will show you how to do fun things that will directly enhance your own applications. Some are visual enhancements to make your software look better. Some are functional improvements to make your software do something it couldn't do before. Some are even just plain silly, in print only to prove it could be done. The book will also give you give you a small glimpse of the applications coming in the future. New technology is streaming into the Java community at a blistering rate, and it gives application developers a whole new set of blocks to play with. With its profusion of tips and tricks, Swing Hacks isn't just for the developer who wants to build a better user interface. It's also ideally suited for client-side Java developers who want to deliver polished applications, enthusiasts who want to push Java client application boundaries, and coders who want to bring powerful techniques to their own applications. Whatever your programming needs, Swing Hacks is packed with programming lessons that increase your competency with interface-building tools.","tags":["Software Development","Programming Languages","JVM Languages","Java"]},{"id":"156592391X","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Java Servlet Programming","authors":["Jason Hunter"],"pages":"526","publication_date":"November 1998","description":"A few years ago, the hype surrounding applets put Java on the map as a programming language for the Web. Today, Java servlets stand poised to take Java to the next level as a Web development language. The main reason is that servlets offer a fast, powerful, portable replacement for CGI scripts. The Java Servlet API, introduced as the first standard extension to Java, provides a generic mechanism to extend the functionality of any kind of server. Servlets are most commonly used, however, to extend Web servers, performing tasks traditionally handled by CGI programs. Web servers that can support servlets include: Apache, Netscape's FastTrack and Enterprise Servers, Microsoft's IIS, O'Reilly's WebSite, and JavaSoft's Java Web Server. The beauty of servlets is that they execute within the Web server's process space and they persist between invocations. This gives servlets tremendous performance benefits over CGI programs. Yet because they're written in Java, servlets are far less likely to crash a Web server than a C-based NSAPI or ISAPI extension. Servlets have full access to the various Java APIs and to third-party component classes, making them ideal for use in communicating with applets, databases, and RMI servers. Plus, servlets are portable between operating systems and between servers -- with servlets you can \"write once, serve everywhere.\" Java Servlet Programming covers everything you need to know to write effective servlets and includes numerous examples that you can use as the basis for your own servlets. The book explains the servlet life cycle, showing how you can use servlets to maintain state information effortlessly. It also describes how to serve dynamic Web content, including both HTML pages and multimedia data. Finally, it explores more advanced topics like integrated session tracking, efficient database connectivity using JDBC, applet-servlet communication, inter-servlet communication, and internationalization.","tags":["Software Development","Programming Languages","JVM Languages","Java"]},{"id":"9781484224519","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Design Patterns in PHP and Laravel","authors":["Kelt Dockins"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"December 2016","description":"Learn each of the original gang of four design patterns, and how they are relevant to modern PHP and Laravel development.

Groovy has much in common with popular scripting languages such as Perl, Python, and Ruby, but is written in a Java-like syntax. And, unlike these other languages, Groovy is sanctioned by the Java community for use on the Java platform. Since it is based on Java, applications written in Groovy can make full use of the Java Application Programmer Interfaces (APIs). This means Groovy can integrate seamlessly with applications written in Java, while avoiding the complexities of the full Java language. This bare-bones structure also means Groovy can be used as an introduction to Java and to programming in general. Its simpler constructions and modern origins make it ideal as a first language and for introducing principles such as object-oriented programming.This book introduces all the major aspects of Groovy development and emphasizes Groovy's potential as a learning tool. Case studies and exercises are included, along with numerous programming examples. The book begins assuming only a general familiarity with Java programming, and progresses to discuss advanced topics such as GUI builders, Groovlets, Unit Testing, and Groovy SQL.\nThe first comprehensive book on Groovy programming that shows how writing applications and scripts for the Java platform is fast and easy\nWritten by leading software engineers and acclaimed computing instructors\nOffers numerous programming examples, code samples, detailed case studies, exercises for self-study, and a companion website with a Windows-based Groovy editor","tags":["Software Development","Programming Languages","JVM Languages","Groovy"]},{"id":"9781498729468","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Advanced Manufacturing for Optical Fibers and Integrated Photonic Devices","authors":["Abdul Al-Azzawi"],"pages":"220","publication_date":"December 2017","description":"This book explores the theoretical principles and industrial practices of high-technology manufacturing.

You can pick up and read this book and build an industry-standard system in a weekend: It has everything you need to get started with a new project. I also found it helpful in reviewing the structure of existing projects.” —Timothy Pratley, developer \n\nDevelopers are discovering the exceptional power of Clojure’s functional programming model to quickly solve problems in domains ranging from social networking to Big Data. Clojure is fast and efficient—ideal for rapid prototyping and lean development. And it is highly expressive and extremely extensible, which makes Clojure one of today’s leading tools for software innovation. Since it targets the Java Virtual Machine, Clojure also leverages the Java platform’s maturity and enormous ecosystem.\n\nClojure Recipes is a wide-ranging, up-to-date “code recipe book” for this increasingly popular language. With practical and self-contained examples, author Julian Gamble illuminates Clojure’s key features and best practices, showing how to solve real-world problems one step at a time. Focusing on Clojure 1.7 and higher, Gamble fully reflects recent enhancements that ensure you’re getting the most up-to-date code for your project.\n\nGamble first walks you through the essential steps required to set up your Clojure development environment, from setting up the Leiningen build tool to packaging Clojure for Java EE environments. He then shows you how to build both basic and advanced REST servers, before turning to a wide range of increasingly sophisticated applications.\n\nIn this book you will find\n\nInnovative Clojure code for diverse web, security, administration, and development tasks, from log reading and app monitoring to software testing\n\nDetailed instructions for using concurrency primitives, writing new DSLs, simplifying cloud database development, and more\n\n“Learn by doing” projects, which offer practical experience with Clojurescript, Storm, Pedestal, Datomic, and other advanced tools\n\nCoverage of using Clojure with Cascalog 2.0 to write complex Hadoop queries with minimal code \n\nThe breadth and quality of Gamble’s examples make Clojure Recipes uniquely valuable both to developers who are exploring Clojure for the first time and to those already using it in production.","tags":["Software Development","Programming Languages","JVM Languages","Clojure"]},{"id":"9781849284875","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Integrated Measurement- KPIs and Metrics","authors":["Daniel McLean"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"May 2013","description":"Understand Metrics and KPIs for IT Service Management\n\nWhen companies look to identify opportunities for improvement, they often turn to Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to measure their current performance in achieving business strategies and objectives.\n\nThere is a common misconception, however, that KPIs are simple measurements that are easy to create, and that the mere act of this measurement will cause people to change their behaviour and improve their performance without additional intervention.\n\nLearn to implement an ITSM KPI management system\n\nIntegrated Measurement – KPIs and Metrics for ITSM is the third title in a series designed to explain, at an operational level, how to implement new processes within an organisation, and how to facilitate the necessary changes to people's behaviour, in order to make that implementation a success.\n\nReal-world KPI experience\n\nThrough an engaging narrative story, this volume in the series looks at the implementation of a KPI management system.

Java developers who need to add audio, video, or interactive media creation and playback to their applications find that QTJ is powerful, but not easy to get into. In fact, when it comes to class-count, QuickTime Java is nearly as large as all of Java 1.1. Once you learn the entire scope of Apple's QuickTime software, you really appreciate the problem. At its simplest, QuickTime allows Mac and Windows users to play audio and video on their computers. But QuickTime is many things: a file format, an environment for media authoring, and a suite of applications that includes browser plug-ins for viewing media within a web page, a PictureViewer for working with still pictures, QuickTime Streaming Server for delivering streaming media files on the Internet in real time, and QuickTime Broadcaster for delivering live events on the Internet. Among others. As if that weren't daunting enough, the javadocs on QJT are wildly incomplete, and other books on the topic are long out of date and not well regarded, making progress with QTJ extremely difficult. So what can you do? Our new hands-on guide, QuickTime Java: A Developer's Notebook, not only catches up with this technology, but de-mystifies it. This practical \"all lab, no lecture\" book is an informal, code-intensive workbook that offers the first real look at this important software. Like other titles in our Developer's Notebook series, QuickTime Java: A Developer's Notebook is for impatient early adopters who want get up to speed on what they can use right now. It's deliberately light on theory, emphasizing example over explanation and practice over concept, so you can focus on learning by doing. QuickTime Java: A Developer's Notebook gives you just the functionality you need from QTJ. Even if you come to realize that 95% of the API is irrelevant to you, this book will help you master the 5% that really counts.","tags":["Software Development","Programming Languages","JVM Languages","Java"]},{"id":"9781000913439","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"How to Swing in Musical Theatre","authors":["Jaye J.

JMS provides a common interface to standard messaging protocols and to special messaging services in support of Java programs. The messages exchange crucial data between computers, rather than between users--information such as event notification and service requests. Messaging is often used to coordinate programs in dissimilar systems or written in different programming languages. Using the JMS interface, a programmer can invoke the messaging services of IBM's MQSeries, Progress Software's SonicMQ, and other popular messaging product vendors. In addition, JMS supports messages that contain serialized Java objects and messages that contain Extensible Markup Language (XML) pages. Messaging is a powerful new paradigm that makes it easier to uncouple different parts of an enterprise application. Messaging clients work by sending messages to a message server, which is responsible for delivering the messages to their destination. Message delivery is asynchronous, meaning that the client can continue working without waiting for the message to be delivered. The contents of the message can be anything from a simple text string to a serialized Java object or an XML document. Java Message Service shows how to build applications using the point-to-point and publish-and-subscribe models; how to use features like transactions and durable subscriptions to make an application reliable; and how to use messaging within Enterprise JavaBeans. It also introduces a new EJB type, the MessageDrivenBean, that is part of EJB 2.0, and discusses integration of messaging into J2EE.","tags":["Software Development","Programming Languages","JVM Languages","Java"]},{"id":"0130355712","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Enterprise JavaBeans™ Component Architecture: Designing and Coding Enterprise Applications","authors":["Gail Anderson","Paul Anderson"],"pages":"464","publication_date":"March 2002","description":"Proven techniques and patterns for enterprise development.\n\nDesign guidelines for EJB 2.0 component architecture\n\nPowerful patterns for enterprise application design\n\nExtensive real-world code examples\n\nCovers every type of component, including message-driven beans\n\nThis book simplifies the creation of well-designed enterprise applications using the upgraded Enterprise JavaBeans 2.0 specification.

Jini technology allows the lines to blur between what is hardware and what is software by representing all hardware and software as Jini technology-enabled \"services,\" accessible either directly or through surrogates written in the Java programming language. In a distributed system of Jini technology-enabled services, these programs interact spontaneously, enabling services to join or leave the network with ease, which allows clients to view and access available services with confidence. A system of Jini technology-enabled services can link office components such as printers, faxes, and desktop computers. Beyond these traditional networks, the technology is also ideal for building the home-based networks that are now emerging: entertainment systems, cars, smart houses, and personal computers.\n\nThis book contains the formal specification for the core Jini technology, as well as specifications for local helper utilities and remote helper services. It offers a review of distributed computing fundamentals, an overview of the Jini architecture, and an introduction to the key concepts that are the source of the technology's simplicity and power--remote objects, leasing, distributed events, and a two-phase commit protocol.

There is, however, space for another such framework that integrates seamlessly with Java. Thousands of companies have invested in Java, and these same companies are losing out on the benefits of a Rails–like framework. Enter Grails.\n\nGrails is not just a Rails clone. It aims to provide a Rails–like environment that is more familiar to Java developers and employs idioms that Java developers are comfortable using, making the adjustment in mentality to a dynamic framework less of a jump. The concepts within Grails, like interceptors, tag libs, and Groovy Server Pages (GSP), make those in the Java community feel right at home.\n\nGrails' foundation is on solid open source technologies such as Spring, Hibernate, and SiteMesh, which gives it even more potential in the Java space: Spring provides powerful inversion of control and MVC, Hibernate brings a stable, mature object relational mapping technology with the ability to integrate with legacy systems, and SiteMesh handles flexible layout control and page decoration.\n\nGrails complements these with additional features that take advantage of the coding–by–convention paradigm such as dynamic tag libraries, Grails object relational mapping, Groovy Server Pages, and scaffolding.\n\nGraeme Rocher, Grails lead and founder, and Jeff Brown bring you completely up–to–date with their authoritative and fully comprehensive guide to the Grails framework. You'll get to know all the core features, services, and Grails extensions via plug–ins, and understand the roles that Groovy and Grails are playing in the changing Web.\n\nWhat you'll learn\n\nDiscover how the Web is changing and the role the Groovy language and its Rails framework play\n\nGet to know the Grails Project and its domains, services, filters, controllers, views, testing, and plug–ins\n\nExperience the availability of plug–ins for Rich Client and Ajax, web services, performance/utilities, scheduling, security, functionality, and even Persistence\n\nSee how Grails works with other frameworks like Spring, Wicket, Hibernate, and more\n\nCreate custom plug–ins in Grails\n\nWho this book is for\n\nThis book is for everyone who is looking for a more agile approach to web development with a dynamic scripting language such as Groovy. This includes a large number of Java developers who have been enticed by the productivity gains seen with frameworks such as Ruby on Rails, JRuby on Rails, etc. The Web and its environment is a perfect fit for easily adaptable and concise languages such as Groovy and Ruby, and there is huge interest from the developer community in general to embrace these languages.","tags":["Software Development","Programming Languages","JVM Languages","Groovy","Grails"]},{"id":"0738498033","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Grid Services Programming and Application Enablement","authors":["Luis Ferreira","Arun Thakore","Michael Brown"],"pages":"298","publication_date":"May 2004","description":"The goal of this IBM Redbooks publication is to familiarize the user with the concepts of the OGSA (Open Grid Services Architecture), OGSI (Open Grid Services Infrastructure), Globus Toolkit V3.0, presenting concrete programmatic examples, and also introducing the enhanced features of the IBM Grid Toolbox.\n\nWe illustrate the various steps needed to develop a grid service application.

The use of the solid elements of the periodic table, together with thousands of complex solid-state samples, largely extends the range of materials employed in plasma harmonics in contrast to the few light rare gases that are typically used. Thus the exploration of practically any available solid-state material through nonlinear spectroscopy comprising laser ablation and harmonic generation can be considered a new tool for materials science. Plasma harmonic spectroscopy exploits the spectral and structural properties of various ablated solid-state materials by propagating short laser pulses through laser-produced plasma and generating high-order harmonics of ultrashort laser pulses.\n\nThe book describes the special features of plasma harmonics in laser-produced ablation plumes and discusses a wide range of nonlinear medium characteristics that can be produced by varying the conditions of laser plume production on the surface of a solid.\n\nThis book compiles and details cutting-edge research in science and medicine from the interdisciplinary team of the Michigan Nanotechnology Institute for Medicine and Biological Sciences, who are currently revolutionizing drug delivery techniques through the development of engineered nanodevices. Edited by Istvan J Majoros and James Baker, Jr., two prominent nanotechnology researchers, this book is designed for workers involved in nanotechnology, macromolecular science, cancer therapy, or drug delivery research.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Engineering","Lasers"]},{"id":"9780124166493","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Introduction to Light Trapping in Solar Cell and Photo-detector Devices","authors":["Stephen J.
