In this iconoclastic new book, Susan Fowler reveals compelling insights and actions to help you master and maintain your motivation. Motivation is at the heart of everything you do and everything you want to do but don't. Unfortunately, the ways we typically motivate ourselves don't work. Relying on sheer determination eventually becomes exhausting—it's not sustainable. And even setting goals can backfire—if you're not setting them for the right reasons. Susan Fowler says motivation is energy, and what matters is the quality, not the quantity. Traditional “motivators” such as fear, guilt, or the promise of a reward provide low-quality, short-term energy. Drawing on the latest empirical research, she proves that high-quality, optimal motivation is a skill that you can learn and apply. Science tells us that satisfying three basic needs—for choice, connection, and competence—is essential to optimal motivation. You need to feel like you've picked your path, not that you're being driven down it. Your goal should be linked to people or a purpose meaningful to you. And you want to continually learn and grow.

Often, as a leader, manager, doctor, teacher, or coach, it's central to your job. But even the most well-intentioned efforts to help others can be undermined by a simple truth: We almost always focus on trying to \"fix\" people, correcting problems or filling the gaps between where they are and where we think they should be. Unfortunately, this doesn't work well, if at all, to inspire sustained learning or positive change.\n\nThere's a better way. In this powerful, practical book, emotional intelligence expert Richard Boyatzis and Weatherhead School of Management colleagues Melvin Smith and Ellen Van Oosten present a clear and hopeful message. The way to help someone learn and change, they say, cannot be focused primarily on fixing problems, but instead must connect to that person's positive vision of themselves or an inspiring dream or goal they've long held. This is what great coaches do--they know that people draw energy from their visions and dreams, and that same energy sustains their efforts to change, even through difficult times. In contrast, problem-centered approaches trigger physiological responses that make a person defensive and less open to new ideas.\n\nThe authors use rich and moving real-life stories, as well as decades of original research, to show how this distinctively positive mode of coaching—what they call \"coaching with compassion\"--opens people up to thinking creatively and helps them to learn and grow in meaningful and sustainable ways.\n\nFilled with probing questions and exercises that encourage self-reflection, Helping People Change will forever alter the way all of us think about and practice what we do when we try to help.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Development"]},{"id":"9781000886726","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Information Economics with Real Estate Applications","authors":["Fredrik Armerin","Madeleine Hoeft"],"pages":"202","publication_date":"June 2023","description":"The purpose of this book is to give the reader an introduction to information economics in the context of applied real estate scenarios.

To be successful, leaders need to sort out what's important, devise strategies based on their own point of view, and get there ahead of the crowd. But most leaders today are just concerned about getting there in time. Many are even willing to settle for getting there fashionably late. They focus on quick-fix problems, avoiding the kinds long-term of dilemmas that will characterize the future. But as Institute for the Future's ten-year forecast—which is included in the book—makes clear, today's leaders face more and more dilemmas: recurring, complex, messy, and puzzling.Bob Johansen shares techniques refined over nearly forty years by the Institute of the Future to help you navigate your own organization's road to the future. He details real-world examples of how organizations like Procter & Gamble, Disney, Reuters, UPS, and the Centers for Disease Control have put these approaches into practice. Through fascinating and illustrative examples—including the Toyota Prius, the iPod, Crest Toothpaste, and many more—he shows that getting there early means finding new markets, new customers, and new products ahead of your competitors. It means anticipating the needs of your stakeholders. It means you'll be able to establish a position before your late-arriving competitors even have a chance to organize. It helps you think through what might happen and what should happen. It gives you time to consider alternative strategies. Ultimately, getting there early helps you see beyond the problems of the present and recognize possible futures before others do. Get There Early lays out the Institute's three-step Foresight to Insight to Action Cycle that allows you to sense, make sense of, and win when faced with dilemmas. Johansen offers hope for leaders facing the constant tension—a dilemma in itself—between judging too soon and deciding too late.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Strategic Thinking"]},{"id":"9781118526316","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"I Have a Strategy (No, You Don't): The Illustrated Guide to Strategy","authors":["Howell J.

Sure, you can find all sorts of high-level strategic tips from Fortune 500 CEOs. But what if you own a restaurant, and you’re trying to figure out how to source good fish, or if you’re looking to increase revenue from your plumbing supply store? You’ll be running a lot of Google searches before you hear from someone who’s actually stood in your shoes. Longtime Square executives Jackie Reses and Lauren Weinberg want to change this. So they reached out across the country, talking to dozens of entrepreneurs with valuable businesses—and invaluable advice. This book is the product of that research. Part starter-kit, part encyclopedia, part inspiration, Self-Made Boss is filled with information not just about who these small business owners are, but how they built their companies, step by step. How did they get their start? When did they decide to hire more staff? How did they set a course for growth? And when problems arose, how did they fight through them? You’ll hear from a second-generation ice cream shop owner on how to manage price increases; an oyster farmer finding new ways to stay afloat in the middle of a global pandemic; a roofer who refused to be denied or defined by her race and gender—and dozens of other small business owners making a big difference in their communities. No matter the size of your business today—or where you’re thinking about taking the jump tomorrow—you’ll find answers you can apply right away. Because there’s a common purpose that all small business owners share: the drive to build something from the ground up; the relentless pursuit of turning obstacles into opportunities and roadblocks into stepping stones. It’s tough and messy, hard-fought and hard-won. And above all, it’s something you can’t have when you work anywhere else—or for anyone else. That’s what it means to be a Self-Made Boss.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy"]},{"id":"9781567263060","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Guide to Contract Pricing, 5th Edition","authors":["John E.

From the international bestselling author of Self-Confidence.\n\nAre You A Worrier?\n\nDo you seem to worry more than most? Do you find that insignificant things stress you out? Do you sweat the small stuff and the big stuff too? Well, now's the time to stop worrying and start living.\n\nWorry, stress, anxiety - whichever label you prefer to use - can have consequences that impact not only our lives, but the lives of others around us. When we worry it's like the engine of our mind is constantly being revved up. It doesn't allow us time to switch off and rest. It tires you out. And when you're tired you're less likely to think straight. And when you're not thinking straight it's easy to make stupid mistakes and confuse priorities...\n\nBut relax. There is a way forward.\n\nIn How Not to Worry Paul McGee shows us that there is a way to tackle life's challenges in a calmer and more considered way. It is possible to use a certain degree of worry and anxiety to spur us on towards positive, constructive action, and then leave the rest behind. With down to earth, real life advice, How Not to Worry helps us understand why worrying is such a big deal and the reasons for it, exposing the behavioural traps we fall into when faced with challenges. It then helps us to move on with tools and ideas to deal with our worries in a more constructive way.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Development","Stress Management"]},{"id":"9781118107966","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"The Ultimate Financial Plan: Balancing Your Money and Life","authors":["Jim Stovall","Tim Maurer"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"September 2011","description":"How to build a financial plan that really blends into your life\n\nThe latest volume in the bestselling Ultimate series, Jim Stovall and Tim Maurer's The Ultimate Financial Plan: Balancing Your Money and Life is a one-stop, comprehensive, personal financial planning book exploring the intersection of money and life.

(Meanwhile, people with good credit have more options than ever, including some of the lowest interest rates in decades.) Debtors need an up-to-date guide that can help them assess options, find help, discover opportunities, and take action that works. Liz Weston's Deal with Your Debt, Updated and Revised Edition is that guide. In this extensively updated guidebook, Weston shows which debts can actually help build wealth over time, and which are simply toxic. She presents up-to-date, real-world strategies for assessing and paying off debt, including money-saving insights on which debts to tackle first. She also offers practical guidelines for assessing how much debt is safe -- and compassionate, realistic guidance for people who've gone beyond the safety zone.\n\nIn There Are No Dumb Questions About Money, nationally-renowned personal finance journalist and best-selling author Liz Weston answers your most pressing questions, helping you navigate today's more-complicated-than-ever financial world. Through real-life reader questions and clear, to-the-point answers, Weston shows how to manage your spending, figure out what you can and can't afford, and choose the smartest ways to pay off your debt. You'll discover why most investment strategies don't work, and identify better ways to save for retirement. But you'll also learn to handle the trickier, emotional side of money: how to avoid fights with your partner, deal with spendthrift children or parents, and spot con artists or lousy advisors before you get robbed. Using humor, keen insight, and time-tested financial planning principles, Weston can help you wrangle your money into shape -- and find your own path to financial freedom.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Personal Finance"]},{"id":"9780133087291","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Powerful PR Strategies for Success (Collection)","authors":["Brian Solis Deirdre K.

It is timeless virtue that creates sustainable value.\n\nThoughtful leaders are keenly aware of the enormous challenge they face to drive high performance in a world that continues to ratchet up pressure and uncertainty. Some leaders respond by getting tough and establishing strict rules. They get people in line, but they don’t inspire excellence. Wise leaders, on the other hand, help their people practice character to navigate their way through the turbulence—without lowering performance expectations. As a result, their people are more reliable under pressure.\n\nException to the Rule links ancient wisdom with contemporary science on high performance, teamwork, and engagement. Building an organizational culture based on classical virtues– of trust, compassion, courage, justice, wisdom, temperance and hope - is both strategically smart and a better way to live.\n\nException to the Rule walks you through the steps of helping everyone in your organization focus on character defined by virtue. The word virtue means excellence, which is why each one is essential to help people perform at a high level despite uncertainty and pressure. Under character--based leadership, teams work better together, creativity flourishes and engagement increases.\n\nThe most powerful idea of Exception to the Rule is this: character defined by virtue is not based on birthright; it can be learned and practiced. Everyone can develop habits to become better than they were. While character cannot be legislated, character can be cultivated.\n\nAs virtue proves its value, the culture you have can evolve into the culture you need.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781119227823","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"The Art of Client Service","authors":["Robert Solomon","Ian Schafer"],"pages":"288","publication_date":"April 2016","description":"A practical guide for providing exceptional client service\n\nMost advertising and marketing people would claim great client service is an elusive, ephemeral pursuit, not easily characterized by a precise skill set or inventory of responsibilities; this book and its author argue otherwise, claiming there are definable, actionable methods to the role, and provide guidance designed to achieve more effective work.\n\nWritten by one of the industry's most knowledgeable client services executives, the book begins with a definition, then follows a path from an initial new business win to beginning, building, losing, then regaining trust with clients.\n\nIt is a powerful source of counsel for those new to the business, for industry veterans who want to refresh or validate what they know, and for anyone in the middle of the journey to get better at what they do.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Sales","Customer Service"]},{"id":"9781788831178","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Lean Product Management","authors":["Mangalam Nandakumar"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"May 2018","description":"\"Lean Product Management\" by Mangalam Nandakumar guides you in creating impactful products that deliver real value.

The simple toolbar in version 2.0 has been packed with so many features since then that few users know where to find them all. Consequently, more and more people are looking for \"insider\" tips that will allow them to use these advanced and often hidden features. Microsoft has addressed this problem in Word 2007 by radically redesigning the user interface with a tabbed toolbar that makes every feature easy to locate and use. Unfortunately, Microsoft's documentation is as scant as ever, so even though you will be able to find advanced features, you might not know what to do with them.\n\nWord 2007: The Missing Manual, written specifically for this version of the software, explains basics like how to create documents, enter and edit text, format, print, and fax. You will will also learn how to create sophisticated page layouts, insert forms and tables, use graphics, and create book-length documents with outlines and Master Documents. Coverage also includes how to share documents with other people and programs, create web pages, automate documents with fields, and automate tasks with macros and the Visual Basic scripting language.

In order to succeed, leaders must be willing to discard old ways of thinking and detrimental business habits—and recognize their blind spots.\nAuthors Jim Haudan and Rich Berens identify the five most common leadership blind spots that hamper success: Purpose, Story, Engagement, Trust, and Truth. They take you straight into the board room of well-known leadership teams to illustrate how these blind spots play out and the impact they have on organizations. You’ll learn how to identify and overcome your own blind spots and embrace positive, forward-thinking new practices.\nWhat’s Your Blind Spot equips you with the tools needed for a personal leadership reset. You’ll discover how to increase engagement, productivity, and growth in your own organization.

It goes on to analyze several examples of management systems for employability at different stages of an individual’s career, and finally explores the issue of developing or maintaining employability in real-life situations and contexts.This book brings together researchers and practitioners from a range of different fields in order to shed light on the complex relationship between mutations and employability.","tags":["Business","Human Resources","Talent Management"]},{"id":"9781562869229","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"How Did I Not See This Coming?: A New Manager's Guide to Avoiding Total Disaster","authors":["Katy Tynan"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"December 2017","description":"Julie’s having a very bad day. She’s a new manager, and her top performer has resigned to escape her, and her own manager is looking on with a skeptical eye. . . . This is the story of her turnaround.\n\nBeing a first-time manager is a tough job. If you were Julie, what would you do? Wouldn’t anyone, given the choice of taking on a leadership role (with a raise), or staying put, have done the same? But no one prepared her for developing co-workers, her former peers, while producing as before and leading the team. Now she’s in over her head.\n\nAuthor Katy Tynan understands. In her new book, How Did I Not See This Coming? A Manager’s Guide to Avoiding Total Disaster, Tynan unlocks the truths about management, showing that first-time managers are basically on a journey without a map. It’s not that employers aren’t investing in their new managers, she says, or that the people in leadership don’t care, but they are no longer close to the raw experience of being a new manager. What’s more, most management books are written by experts who lack the memory of first-time failure.\n\nIn How Did I Not See This Coming?, Tynan tells the fictional story of Julie, a onetime star producer, to illustrate how a new manager can successfully make the shift from a role without leadership responsibilities to one with them. Along the way, Tynan offers the five basic truths about management—starting with recognizing team values and strengths—truths that can be learned by anyone. You, too, can be the manager everyone’s talking about—in a good way—because you’re the one who figured it out.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Team Management"]},{"id":"9780730345770","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Social Media for Business","authors":["Linda Coles"],"pages":"264","publication_date":"August 2017","description":"The quick-and-easy guide to effective social media marketing\n\nSocial Media for Business is the essential guide to navigating the social media maelstrom and effectively promoting your business online.

Human beingsalso have a tendency to think and act hierarchically. In fact, hierarchies — distinct differences in groupmembers' power and status — can be found in virtually every human group, from children on the playground to executives in the boardroom. Although many people have argued that flat organizationspromote innovative thinking, the authors maintain that a properly deployed hierarchy can help teamsengage in and get the most out of their efforts to learn and innovate.Specifically, the authors observe that hierarchies help teams generate, identify, and select new ideasby performing three critical functions: bounding solutions, converging ideas, and structuring processes.\"A paradox of creativity,\" the authors write, \"is that people are more innovative when they have clearconstraints (such as time, budget, customer requirements, etc.) within which their solutions must fit.\"Early on, teams tend to come up with an array of ideas and possibilities. Hierarchies, the authorsexplain, can help sort through which ideas should be pursued and which ones are less promising.The authors provide three recommendations for leaders seeking to leverage the power of hierarchyon teams and avoid its pitfalls. First, organizations should have a clear chain of command. In one study,teams with a clear chain of command were less likely to get bogged down in conflicts and stalematesthan other teams.Second, organizations need to create performance-based cultures in which performance gets measured,publicized, and celebrated. Hierarchies in performance-based cultures are more likely to be basedon expertise, and that can counteract unconscious biases against women and minorities.Third, people at the top of the organization should act in ways that support group goals as opposedto promoting their own interests. Citing a study one of the authors participated in, they write:\"Hierarchies promoted learning and performance when goals and feedback were group-oriented, butthey stifled learning and performance when goals and feedback were individually oriented.\"","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Strategic Thinking"]},{"id":"53863MIT66403","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Virtual Meetings and Your Brain: Four Ways to Refresh","authors":["Eoin Whelan Whelan","René Riedl","Markus Salo"],"pages":"6","publication_date":"March 2025","description":"“Virtual meeting fatigue” is no longer just a buzz phrase — it’s a measurable neurological phenomenon.

Soon consumers will be able to: Control the flow and use of personal data Build their own loyalty programs Dictate their own terms of service Tell whole markets what they want, how they want it, where and when they should be able to get it, and how much it should costAnd they will do all of this outside of any one vendor’s silo. This new landscape we’re entering is what Doc Searls calls The Intention Economyone in which demand will drive supply far more directly, efficiently, and compellingly than ever before. In this book he describes an economy driven by consumer intent, where vendors must respond to the actual intentions of customers instead of vying for the attention of many.New customer tools will provide the engine, with VRM (Vendor Relationship Management) providing the consumer counterpart to vendors’ CRM (Customer Relationship Management) systems. For example, imagine being able to change your address once for every company you deal with, or combining services from multiple companies in real time, in your own waysall while keeping an auditable accounting of every one of your interactions in the marketplace. These tantalizing possibilities and many others are introduced in this book.As customers become more independent and powerful, and the Intention Economy emerges, only vendors and organizations that are ready for the change will survive, and thrive.

Mixing solid data with vivid real-life narratives, Hewlett reveals the “two-way street” that makes sponsorship such a strong and mutually beneficial alliance. The seven-step map at the heart of this book allows you to chart your course toward your greatest goals.Whether you’re looking to lead a company or drive a community campaign, Forget a Mentor, Find a Sponsor will help you forge the relationships that truly have the power to deliver you to your destination.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781118795118","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Ready to Be a Thought Leader?: How to Increase Your Influence, Impact, and Success","authors":["Denise Brosseau","Guy Kawasaki"],"pages":"272","publication_date":"January 2014","description":"The how-to guide to becoming a go-to expert\n\nWithin their fields, thought leaders are sources of inspiration and innovation.

It is timeless virtue that creates sustainable value.\n\nThoughtful leaders are keenly aware of the enormous challenge they face to drive high performance in a world that continues to ratchet up pressure and uncertainty. Some leaders respond by getting tough and establishing strict rules. They get people in line, but they don’t inspire excellence. Wise leaders, on the other hand, help their people practice character to navigate their way through the turbulence—without lowering performance expectations. As a result, their people are more reliable under pressure.\n\nException to the Rule links ancient wisdom with contemporary science on high performance, teamwork, and engagement. Building an organizational culture based on classical virtues– of trust, compassion, courage, justice, wisdom, temperance and hope - is both strategically smart and a better way to live.\n\nException to the Rule walks you through the steps of helping everyone in your organization focus on character defined by virtue. The word virtue means excellence, which is why each one is essential to help people perform at a high level despite uncertainty and pressure. Under character--based leadership, teams work better together, creativity flourishes and engagement increases.\n\nThe most powerful idea of Exception to the Rule is this: character defined by virtue is not based on birthright; it can be learned and practiced. Everyone can develop habits to become better than they were. While character cannot be legislated, character can be cultivated.\n\nAs virtue proves its value, the culture you have can evolve into the culture you need.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9780133819816","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Talking to Siri®: Mastering the Language of Apple’s Intelligent Assistant, Third Edition","authors":["Erica Sadun","Steve Sande"],"pages":"264","publication_date":"March 2014","description":"*Includes a new Q&A with the creator of Siri!

Workers struggle to find answers and information across organizational databases and boundaries and silos. New comfort with social sharing, combined with the proliferation of new social tools, offer easy, useful means of sharing not just what we do but how we get things done. For the organization this supports productivity, improves performance, encourages reflective practice, speeds communication, and helps to surface challenges, bottlenecks, and that elusive tacit knowledge. For the worker it illuminates strengths, talents, struggles, and the reality of how days are spent. For the coworker or colleague it solves a problem, saves time, or builds on existing knowledge. And for management it helps to capture who does what, and how, and otherwise makes visible so much of what is presently opaque.\n\nWhat does showing work mean? It is an image, video, blog post, or use of another tool, or just talking to describe how you solved a problem, show how you fixed the machine, tell how you achieved the workaround, explain how you overcame objections to close the deal, drew the solution to the workflow problem, or photographed the steps you took as you learned to complete a new task. Some of the most effective examples of showing work offer someone explaining how/why they failed, and how they fixed it. Show Your Work offers dozens of examples of individuals and groups showing their work to the benefit of their organizations, their industries, and themselves.\n\nShow Your Work offers dozens of real examples of showing work, supported with tips for how to help it happen, how leaders can lead by showing their own work, and how L&D can extend its reach by showing its own work and helping others show theirs.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Team Management"]},{"id":"9780071809467","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"12 Disciplines of Leadership Excellence: How Leaders Achieve Sustainable High Performance","authors":["Brian Tracy","Peter Chee"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"April 2013","description":"Master the 12 disciplines of powerful leadership and lead your organization to greatness\n\nWe've all heard the phrase \"born leader.\" Leadership experts Brian Tracy and Dr. Peter Chee are here to debunk the myth that you either have it or you don't.

Wouldn’t anyone, given the choice of taking on a leadership role (with a raise), or staying put, have done the same? But no one prepared her for developing co-workers, her former peers, while producing as before and leading the team. Now she’s in over her head.\n\nAuthor Katy Tynan understands. In her new book, How Did I Not See This Coming? A Manager’s Guide to Avoiding Total Disaster, Tynan unlocks the truths about management, showing that first-time managers are basically on a journey without a map. It’s not that employers aren’t investing in their new managers, she says, or that the people in leadership don’t care, but they are no longer close to the raw experience of being a new manager. What’s more, most management books are written by experts who lack the memory of first-time failure.\n\nIn How Did I Not See This Coming?, Tynan tells the fictional story of Julie, a onetime star producer, to illustrate how a new manager can successfully make the shift from a role without leadership responsibilities to one with them.

Although many people have argued that flat organizationspromote innovative thinking, the authors maintain that a properly deployed hierarchy can help teamsengage in and get the most out of their efforts to learn and innovate.Specifically, the authors observe that hierarchies help teams generate, identify, and select new ideasby performing three critical functions: bounding solutions, converging ideas, and structuring processes.\"A paradox of creativity,\" the authors write, \"is that people are more innovative when they have clearconstraints (such as time, budget, customer requirements, etc.) within which their solutions must fit.\"Early on, teams tend to come up with an array of ideas and possibilities. Hierarchies, the authorsexplain, can help sort through which ideas should be pursued and which ones are less promising.The authors provide three recommendations for leaders seeking to leverage the power of hierarchyon teams and avoid its pitfalls. First, organizations should have a clear chain of command. In one study,teams with a clear chain of command were less likely to get bogged down in conflicts and stalematesthan other teams.Second, organizations need to create performance-based cultures in which performance gets measured,publicized, and celebrated. Hierarchies in performance-based cultures are more likely to be basedon expertise, and that can counteract unconscious biases against women and minorities.Third, people at the top of the organization should act in ways that support group goals as opposedto promoting their own interests. Citing a study one of the authors participated in, they write:\"Hierarchies promoted learning and performance when goals and feedback were group-oriented, butthey stifled learning and performance when goals and feedback were individually oriented.\"","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Strategic Thinking"]},{"id":"53863MIT58330","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"The Most Underrated Skill in Management","authors":["Todd Astor","Michael Morales","Don Kieffer"],"pages":"10","publication_date":"April 2017","description":"According to the authors, there are few questions in business more powerful than “What problem are you trying to solve?” The authors argue that leaders who can formulate clear problem statements get more done with less effort and move more rapidly than their less-focused counterparts. Clear problem statements can unlock the energy and innovation that lies within those who do the core work of an organization, whether it be manufacturing, product development, or service. As valuable as good problem formulation can be, it is rarely practiced. Psychologists and cognitive scientists have suggested that the brain is prone to leaping straight from a situation to a solution without pausing to define the problem clearly. Such “jumping to conclusions” can be effective, particularly when done by experts facing extreme time pressure, like fighting a fire or performing emergency surgery. But, when making change in an organization, neglecting to formulate a clear problem statement often prevents innovation and leads to wasted time and money.A good problem statement has five basic elements:• It references something the organization cares about and connects that element to a clear and specific goal;• it contains a clear articulation of the gap between the current state and the goal;• the key variables — the target, the current state, and the gap — are generally quantifiable, even if they cannot be measured objectively;• it is as neutral as possible concerning possible diagnoses or solutions; • and it is sufficiently small in scope that it can be tackled quickly.To tackle complex problems, executives need to complement good problem formulation with a structured approach to problem-solving. The authors recommend an approach using a modified version of the A3 form, which was originally developed by Toyota Motor Corp. to support knowledge sharing in its factories by summarizing a structured problem-solving effort in a single page.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Innovation"]},{"id":"9780132102568","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Steps to Become a Whole-Brain Trader","authors":["Curtis Faith"],"pages":"11","publication_date":"April 2010","description":"This Element is an excerpt from Trading from Your Gut: How to Use Right Brain Instinct & Left Brain Smarts to Become a Master Trader (9780137047680) by Curtis Faith.

Hassett, a corporate development executive, author and specialist in value management, mergers and acquisitions, new venture strategy, development, and execution for high technology, SaaS, web, and mobile businesses, the book convincingly demonstrates that the equity risk premium is proportional to long-term Treasury yields, establishing a connection to loss aversion theory.\n\nExplains stock prices from 1960 through the present including the 2008/09 \"market meltdown\"\n\nShows how the S&P 500 has consistently reverted to values predicted by the model\n\nSolves the equity premium puzzle by showing that it is consistent with findings on loss aversion\n\nDemonstrates that three factors drive valuation and stock price: earnings, long term growth, and interest rates\n\nUnderstanding the stock market is simple.

Soon consumers will be able to: Control the flow and use of personal data Build their own loyalty programs Dictate their own terms of service Tell whole markets what they want, how they want it, where and when they should be able to get it, and how much it should costAnd they will do all of this outside of any one vendor’s silo. This new landscape we’re entering is what Doc Searls calls The Intention Economyone in which demand will drive supply far more directly, efficiently, and compellingly than ever before. In this book he describes an economy driven by consumer intent, where vendors must respond to the actual intentions of customers instead of vying for the attention of many.New customer tools will provide the engine, with VRM (Vendor Relationship Management) providing the consumer counterpart to vendors’ CRM (Customer Relationship Management) systems. For example, imagine being able to change your address once for every company you deal with, or combining services from multiple companies in real time, in your own waysall while keeping an auditable accounting of every one of your interactions in the marketplace. These tantalizing possibilities and many others are introduced in this book.As customers become more independent and powerful, and the Intention Economy emerges, only vendors and organizations that are ready for the change will survive, and thrive.

Developing the requisite mathematical background as needed, the text presents an introduction to probability theory and stochastic calculus suitable for undergraduate students in mathematics, economics, and finance.\n\nThe first nine chapters of the book describe option valuation techniques in discrete time, focusing on the binomial model.

The remaining chapters illustrate the theory in continuous time, with an emphasis on the more mathematically sophisticated Black-Scholes-Merton model.\n\nLargely self-contained, this classroom-tested text offers a sound introduction to applied probability through a mathematical finance perspective. Numerous examples and exercises help students gain expertise with financial calculus methods and increase their general mathematical sophistication.

Companies and brands from Altoids to Volkswagen have discovered the answer: bring show business into your business!\n\nThere's No Business That's Not Show Business demonstrates how to use \"show biz\" techniques to cut through the clutter, engage your customers personally, differentiate your product or brand--and create real, long--term value.\n\nThese techniques can be adapted for any product, service, or market--consumer or B2B. You'll learn how to clearly identify strategic objectives and expected outcomes; target your high--value customers; ensure that \"show biz\" marketing promotes your core brand message; extend your impact via PR and CRM; and, above all, achieve quantifiable results.\n\nThe right show, the right media, the right venue\n\nChoose, invent, and re--invent media around your unique marketing needs\n\nKeeping your show \"on brand\"\n\nDrive your core branding message: don't distract from it\n\nShows for customers, with customers, and by customers\n\nUse show business to strengthen all your customer relationships\n\nIntegrating show business and leadership\n\nPersona, myth, and ethos: shape the experience of your own company\n\nNot just show: business\n\nPractical measurements, credible budgets, real ROI\n\nShow biz techniques that cut through market clutter--and delight and engage your customers!\n\nBuilding experiences that engage, surprise, and dazzle your customers\n\nTying \"show biz\" marketing to measurable business goals\n\nBreakthrough techniques for consumer, B2B, even internal marketing initiatives\n\nMobile marketing, street evangelism, customer events, theater, and much more\n\nAltoids to Oracle, Volkswagen to Victoria's Secret: new case studies in experiential marketing\n\nCustomers today are more independent than ever, and advertising less effective and more costly every day. There's No Business that's Not Show Business shows how smart companies can use creativity, humor, and play to reach out and engage customers through a new kind of experience. This book provides winning case studies and \"show business\" techniques that can be used to dazzle customers, launch products, build brands, generate buzz, and build great customer relationships. From road shows to street evangelism to multi--media theater and beyond, it offers a new generation of marketing that can work for every customer in every industry. Most of all, it offers tools to link your \"show business\" to your brand, to core strategic goals, and to measurable results. Your business can be in show business too--and to reach customers today, it must!\n\nPraise for There's No Business That's Not Show Business\n\n\"This book cleverly and insightfully makes explicit a clear (if upsetting to some) trend, i.e. 'all the world's a stage.' As the emphasis has moved from the physical product (or service) to customer experience, how consumers relate to products in their own authored \"play\" has increasingly become the focus of marketing thought and practice. Using a variety of well--known (e.g. Victoria's Secret, Intel) and less obvious (e.g., the Guggenheim) examples, the book explores the implications of a focus on the show/experience in an entertaining way. Importantly, however, the book also provides a seven--step procedure for moving from identification of a desired image to the quantitative measurement of performance. This raises the book above the level of identifying a phenomenon to the position of suggesting something useful to do about it. The real value of a book is whether it causes the reader to think as well as stay awake. This one succeeds on both counts.\"\n\n--Don Lehmann, George E. Warren Professor of Business, Columbia University Graduate School of Business\n\n\"This will be one of the most important business books you'll ever read! It will convince you you're really in show business and that if you're not, you'd better be. Implement the star--studded findings the authors reveal, and you'll have a huge competitive advantage over your competition. Let the show begin.\"\n\n--Jason Jennings, worldwide bestselling author of It's Not the Big That Eat the Small--It's the Fast That Eat the Slow and Less Is More\n\n\"Bernd Schmitt is unquestionably one of the most creative and original minds in marketing. Well worth the price of admission, his new book with David Rogers and Karen Vrotsos provides sharp, witty insights and engaging case studies that brilliantly illuminate how entertaining experiences can build strong brands.\"\n\n--Kevin Lane Keller, E.B. Osborn Professor of Marketing, Amos Tuck School of Business, Dartmouth College\n\n\"Schmitt, Rogers, and Vrotsos demonstrate vividly that there is a New Marketing Mix without which your products won't grab any attention, spark any interest, or build any memorable experience.\"\n\n--Philip Kotler, Northwestern Kellogg School of Business, and author of Marketing Management, 11th edition\n\n\"The authors practice what they preach by presenting a book that is both entertaining and thought--provoking.

Alex Goldfayn, CEO of the Evangelist Marketing Institute, shows how to grow your organization by 15% or more in 15 minutes or less per day—without spending a penny of your money.\n\nForget about relying on social media. Posting on Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn doesn't grow revenue, especially for business-to-business companies. The Revenue Growth Habit shows how to request and collect testimonials and how to communicate these testimonials to grow your business. You will discover how to write powerful case studies, ask for (and get!) referrals, grow your lists, and send a revenue-growing newsletter. Goldfayn also includes information for teaching your customer service people how to inform your current clients about what else they can buy from you. This proven approach revolves around letting your customers tell your story. There is nothing you can say about your products and services that is more effective than what your paying customers say.\n\nHow does it work? Each day, take one quick, proactive communication action that tells someone about how they'll be improved after buying from you. Choose from the 22 actions Goldfayn details in The Revenue Growth Habit. Each technique is fast, simple, and free. It only requires your personal effort to communicate the value of your product or service to someone who can buy from you. Personal communication—the key to the 22 action steps—will make your company stand head-and-shoulders above the competition.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Sales","Customer Success"]},{"id":"9781119347224","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Creative Courage","authors":["Welby Altidor"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"September 2017","description":"Achieve more, do more, create more with the power of creative courage\n\nCreative Courage challenges you to step outside of your comfort zone and truly make an impact.

Stevenson Smith to offer a wealth of smart investing advice for today's investor. This plain-English guide to good investing presents practical strategies and actionable advice for safely navigating today's financial markets.

But companies have been dealing with an exponentially increasing amount of data, and much of it in forms that are impossible to manage by traditional analytics. “Big data” includes information such as call center voice data, social media content and video entertainment, as well as clickstream data from the web.\n\nThe authors posit that organizations that are learning to take advantage of big data are beginning to understand their business environments at a more granular level, are creating new products and services, and are responding more quickly to change as it occurs. These companies stand apart from those with traditional data analysis environments in three critical ways.\n\nFirst, rather than looking at data to assess what happened in the past, these organizations consider data in terms of flows and processes, and make decisions and take actions quickly. In addition, organizations already involved with big data are taking a lead on hiring — and training — data scientists and product and process developers as opposed to data analysts. And finally, advanced organizations are moving analytics from IT into their core business and operational functions. As big data evolves, a new information ecosystem is also evolving, a network that is continuously sharing information, optimizing decisions, communicating results and generating new insights for businesses.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Digital Transformation"]},{"id":"9780132478779","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Japan: A Cautionary Tale","authors":["Vinh Q.

Most of the compensation now is designed to be performance-based, but leading to charges that executives have incentives to manipulate corporate earnings and stock price in the short-term for their own self interests. The compensation at some companies became so egregious that compensation again became a major public policy issue subject to federal regulation. Executive Compensation focuses on the major topics related to executive compensation—present, past, and future. First, is understanding what executive compensation is, including composition and objectives of pay contracts. Second, how do specific compensation agreements affect corporate behavior and performance? Third, what are the major components, including how and what are accounted for and disclosed? How is compensation, especially executive compensation, accounted for—that is, what are the calculations and journal entries required? Fourth, what does historical analysis tell us about the topic, especially how contractual decisions have been made and what has worked. Finally, what is in store for the future—both expected compensation agreements and what the compensation incentives suggest for future corporate decisions on operations and accounting manipulation.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Business Ethics"]},{"id":"9781422172612","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Executing Strategy","authors":["Harvard Business Review"],"pages":"128","publication_date":"August 2009","description":"Every day on the job, you face common challenges.

This book provides unique insights into the experience of seasoned academics who embed business ethics in teaching management theory and practice. Its multidisciplinary approach enriches its content, since the insights of our colleagues from within their fields are invaluable. It therefore complements other business textbooks. After general themes (curriculum integration, adult learning, learner commitment, and generation Y classrooms), this volume covers ethics and responsibility in people management, team building, change management; operations management, business law, and digital marketing communications.The book provides a platform to share experiences of teaching ethical profitability. It contributes to resolving concerns experienced when faculty wish to incorporate ethics into their teaching but feel they lack preparation or ideas on how to do it. The chapters describe each discipline briefly, raise the typical ethical issues therein, and suggest teaching strategies and exercises or projects. The 'developing versus developed country perspectives' sections may interest schools with high student diversity. The book also meets in-company training needs for attaining and sustaining an ethical culture.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Business Ethics"]},{"id":"9781118391693","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"What Works","authors":["Robert Cornish","Wil Seabrook"],"pages":"169","publication_date":"January 2013","description":"Praise for What Works\n\n\"What Works is essential reading for any businesspeople who want to improve their organizations and their own abilities.

Those who possess it are generally luckier in love, more likely to be popular, and more apt to get better grades in school. But very few of us realize just how much looks affect every aspect of our lives. Recent studies document that people blessed with good looks earn about 10% more than their average-looking colleagues. They are also more likely to get hired and promoted at work. What exactly is this \"physical attractiveness\" phenomenon and how does it affect each and every one of us?\n\nDr. Gordon L. Patzer has devoted the last 30 years to investigating this unsettling phenomenon for both women and men, and how it touches every part of our lives. In Looks, he reveals not only its impact on romance, but also on family dynamics, performance in school, career, courtroom proceedings, politics and government. Looks is the first book to explore how the power of beauty affects both sexes and how the rise of reality TV shows, cosmetic surgery, and celebrity culture have contributed to our culture’s overall obsession with being beautiful.\n\nUnflinching and topical, Looks uncovers the sometimes ugly truth about beauty and its profound effects on all our lives.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Development","Confidence / Motivation"]},{"id":"9781264269259","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Show Your Worth: 8 Intentional Strategies for Women to Emerge as Leaders at Work","authors":["Shelmina Babai Abji"],"pages":"256","publication_date":"June 2022","description":"Foreword by Rodney Adkins, Former Senior Vice President at IBM, Chairman at Avnet, and Board Member at PayPal, UPS, and Grainger\n\nDelivering must-have tools to harness the power of intention and strategy to achieve career success—tailor-made for women who are underrepresented in their fields.\n\nWhether you’re just starting out in the working world or a seasoned veteran, Show Your Worth is an incredible resource and a compelling blueprint for women looking to advance their own careers.—Chris Nassetta, CEO, Hilton\n\nIf you're a woman, especially a woman of color, you know this already: You face unique challenges and obstacles as you work to scale the corporate ladder.

Today's professionals feel rushed, overwhelmed, and perennially behind. So we keep our heads down, focused on the next thing, and the next, without a moment to breathe.\n\nHow can we break out of this endless cycle and create the kind of interesting, meaningful lives we all seek?\n\nJust as CEOs who optimize for quarterly profits often fail to make the strategic investments necessary for long-term growth, the same is true in our own personal and professional lives. We need to reorient ourselves to see the big picture so we can tap into the power of small changes that, made today, will have an enormous and disproportionate impact on our future success. We need to start playing The Long Game.\n\nAs top business thinker and Duke University professor Dorie Clark explains, we all know intellectually that lasting success takes persistence and effort. And yet so much of the relentless pressure in our culture pushes us toward doing what's easy, what's guaranteed, or what looks glamorous in the moment. In The Long Game, she argues for a different path. It's about doing small things over time to achieve our goals—and being willing to keep at them, even when they seem pointless, boring, or hard.\n\nIn The Long Game, Clark shares unique principles and frameworks you can apply to your specific situation, as well as vivid stories from her own career and other professionals' experiences. Everyone is allotted the same twenty-four hours—but with the right strategies, you can leverage those hours in more efficient and powerful ways than you ever imagined. It's never an overnight process, but the long-term payoff is immense: to finally break out of the frenetic day-to-day routine and transform your life and your career.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy"]},{"id":"9781615424818","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Take Control of Your Digital Legacy, 2nd Edition","authors":["Joe Kissell"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"February 2024","description":"Preserve your data for posterity!

These markets are inextricably entwined with underlying monetary standards and consequently they are treated conjointly in this book. Four different foreign exchange rate regimes are analyzed including exchange rates under commodity money, fiduciary money, fiat money (with fixed exchange rates), and fiat money (with flexible exchange rates).\n\nFor more than eight decades, most countries have operated with fiat money. Proponents maintain that fiat money provides individual countries with much greater monetary autonomy. Yet both analytics and experience indicate that this is not always the case. Whether a country has more monetary autonomy depends on whether fiat money is paired with fixed or flexible exchange rates. Although flexible exchange rate regimes are not without their critics, it has become increasingly apparent that fiat money with flexible rates provides individual countries much greater monetary autonomy. This arrangement allows participants in foreign exchange markets greater latitude for adjusting to the wide variations in national monetary policies that are prevalent with fiat money.\n\nSeveral audiences may find this book beneficial: undergraduate students in economics and finance, students of international business, graduate students, students in executive programs who need to expand their knowledge of international finance, and practicing executives and managers—especially those who are employed by companies operating globally.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Financial Markets","Forex"]},{"id":"9781292084022","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"How to Influence in any situation","authors":["Mike Clayton"],"pages":"216","publication_date":"January 2015","description":"Whatever you do in life, whatever you hope to achieve, How to Influence in Any Situation will help you get there – with the power of influence.

Yet history proves that a new generation of success stories will likely emerge from this era of financial chaos. And this new book prepares you to be one of those success stories by analyzing the inner qualities that have propelled the forward-thinking leaders of our time: drive, determination, and self-awareness.\n\nAs strategists for the internationally renowned consumer and political research firm Penn, Schoen & Berland Associates, Michael Berland and Douglas Schoen are experts in how successful people think . . . and how they win.

If you've just been promoted, how do you handle the tensions of managing former peers? And what are the telltale mental signs that it's time to start planning your next career move?\n\nWe know that psychology can teach us much about behaviors and challenges relevant to work, such as making better decisions, influencing people, and dealing with stress. But many popular books on these topics analyze them as universal human phenomena without providing real-life, constructive career help.\n\nBring Your Brain to Work changes all that. Professor, author, and popular radio host Art Markman focuses on three essential elements of a successful career--getting a job, excelling at work, and finding your next position--and expertly illustrates how cognitive science, especially psychology, sheds fascinating and useful light on each of these elements.\n\nTo succeed at a job interview, for example, you need to understand the mindset of the interviewer and know how to come across as exactly the individual the company wants to hire.

Office 2004 for Mac: The Missing Manual is the manual that should have been in the box. It's the map that clearly and easily guides both beginners and veterans through this new suite. Mark H. Walker, Franklin Tessler, and Paul Berkowitz deliver all the practical information you need to master the basics and make the most of all four Office 2004 programs--Word, Excel, Powerpoint, and Entourage. It's four books in one! According to Microsoft's own research, the average Office user taps into less than fifteen percent of the suite's features. With first-rate writing, a handcrafted index, and the trademark humor and clarity of every Missing Manual, Office 2004 for Mac: The Missing Manual will change that. Because this isn't an authorized book, Walker, Tessler, and Berkowitz candidly point out which features are gems in the rough worthy of your focused attention--and which are junkware that you best continue to overlook. Whether you're an Office beginner eager to master one or all of the applications in the suite or a longtime Office user looking for detailed coverage of what's new (and what's removed) in Office 2004 and hoping to implement power-user techniques for better and more efficient work, this funny and friendly, comprehensive guide will prove indispensable.","tags":["Business","Business / Personal Technology","iWork"]},{"id":"9781637425589","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Make Your Internship Count","authors":["Marti Fischer"],"pages":"188","publication_date":"January 2024","description":"Moving from student to employee can be a scary transition.Make Your Internship Count takes you step-by-step, from the initial decision to pursue an internship through pitching a full-time job, to make your leap into the working world easier and less stressful.\n\nThis book gives you a competitive advantage and tells you what employers expect including how to meet those expectations.

These perplexing, recurring issues are familiar to anyone in a leadership role today, including:\n\nHow do I balance my functional or business unit goals with the needs of my peers and the whole company?\n\nHow do I support and promote others while still advancing my own career?\n\nHow do I emphasize teamwork and still reward the \"stars\"?\n\nCan I really devote enough time and energy to both family and work?\n\nThese are not \"problems\" but paradoxes—situations in which there will never be a single correct solution—and while they make many leaders feel overwhelmed and challenged, this remarkable book provides help. The Unfinished Leader is a modern handbook for recognizing, facing, and inspiring others to expose the real issues that underlie paradoxes in modern organizations. Leaders must first recognize situations they will never be able to \"solve\" and understand how to confront the barriers—in their own heads and their organizations—that push them towards seeking ultimate solutions that don't exist. Leading through complexity requires giving up the illusion of control, consistency, and closure, while embracing the reality of being permanently \"unfinished.\"\n\nDrawing from interviews with 100 CEOs and top leaders from a wide range of companies—such as Avon, Nike, Colgate, DeutschePost DHL, Johnson &amp; Johnson, PepsiCo, and many more—The Unfinished Leader provides the mindsets and tools to recognize contradictory requirements, understand competing demands, and still be able to take action. No one can find or even should look for perfect solutions to impossible situations. The Unfinished Leader will help leaders at all levels understand and excel at their true task: guiding themselves and their teams through ongoing paradoxes, reconciling competing outcomes, continually changing and adapting, and thereby building lasting success.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781264278084","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"One Bold Move a Day: Meaningful Actions Women Can Take to Fulfill Their Leadership and Career Potential","authors":["Shanna A.

But Oyer had a secret weapon: economics.It turns out that dating sites are no different than the markets Oyer had spent a lifetime studying. Monster.com, eBay, and other sites where individuals come together to find a match gave Oyer startling insight into the modern dating scene. The arcane language of economicssearch, signaling, adverse selection, cheap talk, statistical discrimination, thick markets, and network externalitiesprovides a useful guide to finding a mate.

In this book, she shares her strategies and helps you tap into a substantial body of scientific research to help further innovative practice within your own company. For example, rewarding failed innovations can actually be a critical aspect of building an innovation culture. It's rarely done, but it fosters creative thought by signaling to people that failure is tolerated and is a necessary ingredient in the pursuit of innovation. This kind of practical, easily implemented strategy is the lynchpin of cultural change. This guide shares fourteen separate, yet interconnected strategies for improving your company's innovation culture, and provides illustrative examples of real-world companies who are putting these plans into action.\n\nBusiness innovation guides tend to focus on how one company does it. But it's not your company, and just because it worked for Google or Apple doesn't mean that it's right for you.

Well, except at one thing, he was always playing politics - sucking up to the more senior guys and volunteering to be on any committee going.\n\nDebra knew the type - went to the same school, belonged to the same club - she didn't have a hope against the kind of connections he had so she might as well give up.

Kloppenborg"],"pages":"4","publication_date":"April 2015","description":"To improve the chances that projects will be successful, organizations often choose senior executiveswith an interest in the outcome to act as the project sponsors. Executive sponsors are responsible forlining up the necessary resources at the beginning, managing certain activities while the project is underway, and ultimately delivering results. Since sponsors rarely have enough time to manage projects personally, they must rely heavily on project managers. So which activities and behaviors can busy sponsors perform in the course of a project to increase the chances of project success?In researching what makes for successful project sponsorship, the authors used a project life cyclemodel with four stages: (1) initiating — from the preliminary idea through approved charter; (2) planning— from approved charter through approved project plan; (3) executing — from approved projectplan through acceptance of major deliverables; and (4) closing — from acceptance of major deliverablesthrough final completion.Project success historically has been defined by the “iron triangle” of cost, schedule and performance.The authors use a broader definition based on three success factors. The first success factor involvesimpact on the project’s customers, which is almost always the most important success measure. Thesecond success factor involves meeting agreements: Was the project completed on time, on budget andto specifications? The third success factor is tied to the future benefits to the company, be they newtechnology, new products, new markets and/or commercial success.The authors conducted separate studies of each project life-cycle stage, using literature reviews, focusgroups, surveys and factor analysis in order to examine sponsor behavior and project success factors.For each stage, they found that two or three behaviors had a significant impact on the project successfactors. In the initiating stage, the important behaviors for executive sponsors involve setting performance goals for the project, selecting and mentoring the project manager and establishing priorities. In the project’s planning stage, the key sponsor behaviors are ensuring planning and developing relationships with stakeholders. While the project is being executed, important roles for executive sponsors involve ensuring adequate and effective communication, maintaining relationships with stakeholders and ensuring quality. In the project’s closing stage, identifying and capturing lessons learned and ensuring that capabilities and benefits are realized are critical sponsor activities.","tags":["Business","Project & Product Management","Project Management"]},{"id":"9780749471811","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"The Responsible Leader","authors":["Tim Richardson"],"pages":"216","publication_date":"February 2015","description":"Challenge assumptions from established management thinking and achieve responsible, authentic, and sustainable leadership at your organisation.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781292095813","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Business Express: How to communicate Change to your Team","authors":["Gill Hasson"],"pages":"1","publication_date":"July 2015","description":"If you need to be in the know in no time at all, Business Express will get you from beginner to brilliant in the blink of an eye. This fast, focused and carefully crafted eBook will help you pick up all the essential knowledge you need about the skills that matter most at work, all in the shortest possible time. Learn just when you need to or well in advance; read it at your desk or on the move; dip in and out or start from scratch - it’s all up to you.

The expectation was that you worked until age 65—and then coasted through your golden years courtesy of a comfortable nest egg.\n\nToday, when living to 90 is common, when savings are slim, when people work longer and change jobs frequently, clinging to an outdated concept of retirement gets you nowhere. The changes ahead require an incremental approach to planning—and you better begin now.\n\nThe new After 50 Lifestyle calls for more than money: it demands conscious engagement, diverse interests, and the ability to adapt. How Do I Get There from Here? helps you plot your direction for the coming decades. The first step is to acknowledge where you are—reviewing your assets, both the tangible (e.g. finances, health, relationships) and intangible (e.g. unfulfilled ambitions and new intentions). Then self-reflective questions and exercises walk you through imagining your future, identifying skills you'll need, and preparing for inevitable twists and turns along the way.\n\nA retirement of nonstop leisure is not just unreachable, but for most, undesirable. How Do I Get There from Here? guides you toward a dynamic future...designed just for you.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Personal Finance"]},{"id":"9781119249054","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"J.K.

Our observant hero learns from others' experiences, as well as his own.

They continuously strive to introduce new products and services at a rate that satisfies their customers. In their search for fresh ideas, organizations often overlook the most significant source of new thought — their employees. Today’s employees are knowledgeable and able to see opportunities or solutions to problems. This book describes a process for turning \"great ideas\" into actionable proposals. It presents a simple, but powerful set of questions that has proven to deliver a never-ending stream of inspiration to an organization.\n\nAlthough formal processes for project initiation, execution, and completion may be firmly embedded in an organization’s project life cycle, little is said about project origins. In Project Identification, the author provides a formal process that encourages and enables all of your employees, from the corporate suite to the college hire, to participate in the innovation process. The book presents a mechanism for identifying and capturing great ideas and inspired thought as new project proposals. It provides you with a repeatable process to organize, evaluate, and then select candidate projects for initiation.\n\nIn the first part of the book, the author describes the complete project life cycle and explains how the Project Identification process complements the formal Project Management methodology. The book then presents a series of questions that guide the decision-making process for identifying new projects. For each question, the author includes an example from a real proposal that demonstrates how to craft useful content.\n\nThe book concludes by explaining how to capture and manage each of the formal proposals and make sure they are properly considered. It details the transition of a candidate project to a live effort, ready for project initiation. This book can help streamline how your organization conceptualizes and approves projects.

Deliberately challenging practitioners to do more, this insightful discussion sorts through the tools and techniques developed over the last century to examine their true relevance to the modern workplace. You'll learn which activities show the greatest potential to improve the lives of employees and the organizations they work for, and identify which of your existing practices don't really add enough value to be worth the expenditure of time, money, and potentially lost talent. The author asks you to make up your own mind about which approaches work best for your own specific talent decisions, but provides the best theory and practice available today as a foundation upon which to formulate a more relevant strategy.\n\nIn a world of big data, the potential to understand employees and react appropriately has never been greater. So why is Talent Management as an industry relying on outdated theory and practices? This book is a guide to bringing HR up to date, giving you the tools, techniques, and perspective you need to demonstrate more value to your organization.\n\nAdopt the tools and techniques most effective in today's workplace\n\nIdentify and discard methods that don't add value to the organization\n\nImplement critical changes that can transform the HR function\n\nMake better people decisions based on psychology and research\n\nFundamentally, not much has changed in what constitutes good people practice.

But how do you attract the best people? What do they really want? Based on his rigorous and extensive research, Mark Miller learned that top performers are looking for very different things than solid contributors. In Talent Magnet, Miller uses a clever and entertaining business fable to share these findings. He tells the parallel stories of Blake Brown, a CEO struggling with winning the war for talent, and Blake's sixteen-year-old son Clint, who is trying to get his first job so he can raise money to buy a well for a village in Africa. Blake reaches out to leaders in other industries and works with his team to solve the puzzle of making his organization a destination for exceptional performers. But he also learns from his son. Listening to Clint and his friends compare notes on the companies they've worked for that summer, ranging from the awful to the inspirational, Blake realizes they want the same three things out of a job as any top performer in a Fortune 500 company.Miller identifies these three critical aspects of a true talent magnet and explores the deeper meaning of each.

That is, know-how that lives inside their organizations or networks â in the teams, processes and experts that comprise them.\n\nYet, many organizations are coming up short in this race. Knowledge sharing and transfer have been reduced to reports, e-mails and tweets replacing vital personal interaction. The lack of meaningful conversation coupled with intense fragmentation across organizations and networks has left leaders floating in a sea of information and ideas without a map to channel insight into action.\n\nSharing Hidden Know-How starts the conversation that allows organizations to take what they know to the bank.

For them it's about what they will do for you today and what you will do for them today, not tomorrow, not five years from today, but today.\n\nHe will explain why they have no interest in tying their futures to your corporation. But he will also make clear that they do have a well thought-out plan for themselves, one that requires that every job they take build up their skill sets, so they become more valuable employees for someone else--if and when you do not fulfill your end of the bargain, or drag your feet in doing so.\n\nBut most of all, it will explain to corporate leaders that for this generation their personal life comes first, so that each job they take must accommodate itself to some need defined by their personal life. Tulgan argues that until you know the personal need the job can satisfy for a potential employee, you and the applicant may be talking past each other. Those needs are so beyond the imagination of most bosses that Tulgan devotes a third of the book to explaining how they affect the job decisions of this generation.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management"]},{"id":"9781631572951","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"You're A Genius","authors":["Steven Taylor"],"pages":"183","publication_date":"August 2015","description":"If you want to excel at any art form, you have to master the craft.

Consequently, it is resourced by in-house staff working on the project as homework, meaning in addition to their normal responsibilities.

However, they are largely unrecognized as a separate organizational category of project, with particular characteristics, management needs, and risks.\n\nThe People Project Triangle refers to the trade-off between the project, the ongoing business, and the people working in them.

Yet the average tenure of a chief marketing officer (CMO) is three and a half years, well below that of the typical CEO. Both the prevalence of the CMO position and its precariousness give rise to the question,“ Has marketing realized the vision to which its adherents have long aspired?”\n\nThe authors look at the IMB 2011 Global CMO Study to extrapolate trends in marketing. In the study, more than 1,700 CMOs were asked to rate how much influence they have over four key aspects of marketing. They were also asked to what extent their marketing organization captures, analyzes and acts on customer data. The authors calculate an overall metric, the “Full-Scale Marketing Index”, to measure average control over each of the four aspects, plus use of data. From their findings they explore whether it is important to follow the “Marketing Ideal” established over 60 years ago, and where Marketing goes from here.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Marketing"]},{"id":"53863MIT57303","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Finding the Right Role for Social Media in Innovation","authors":["Frank T.

Yet the authors argue that there is a significant opportunity that isn’t being realized: utilizing social media to support innovation and new product development.\n\nConsultants and academics alike have touted social media as a vehicle for developing customer insights, accessing knowledge, cocreating ideas and concepts with users, and supporting new product launches. Yet despite this promise, the authors have found that the expected positive results are frequently not realized in practice. Although some companies have been able to use social media to develop new insights that lead to successful new products, many others simply do not know how to utilize social media for innovation. Some get distracted by the diversity of input and listen to the “wrong audience.” Nevertheless, the authors believe that social media provides a game-changing opportunity for companies that learn how to develop clear strategies and objectives.\n\nAnalyzing data on the social media practices of large global companies as they relate to new product development, the authors found that for the companies that jumped on the bandwagon and invested in social media initiatives without having a clear strategy, the right skills, or sufficient knowledge frequently did not achieve the results they were looking for. Those that utilized social media sources exclusively to search for technical information saw no improvements in new product development performance; in fact, the effect on performance for these companies was often negative (due to information overload and the complexity of processing such information). The companies that benefited the most from using social media for new product development were companies that used social media in every stage of the new product development processes; they built organizational processes and structures to support new product development activity.\n\nThe authors use the analogy of summer camp, a setting where children can explore and learn from everything they do. They describe three “camps”: Camp Explore, Camp Cocreate, and Camp Communicate. Each camp offers a distinctive approach to thinking about the different phases of the innovation process and delivers an important skill set.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Innovation"]},{"id":"9781604914061","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Leadership in Action: Issues and Observations - How Leaders Can Get Off the Hamster Wheel","authors":["Melodie Jancerak"],"pages":"2","publication_date":"June 2002","description":"People who are stuck tend to be able to describe the situation and the problem in excruciating detail.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781604913613","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Leadership in Action: In Focus - The Leadership Journey - Leadership Begins with Leading Oneself","authors":["Tomo Noda"],"pages":"2","publication_date":"December 2004","description":"The shift from leading oneself to leading others and realizing transformation and creation requires leaders to have many quantum-leap experiences.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"53863MIT63206","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"How Collaboration Needs Change From Mind to Marketplace","authors":["Jill E.

Various experts have ventured theories about what kind of content makes for a hit. The advice varies widely and is even contradictory. Depending on the expert, success is thought more likely if a video is humorous, shocking, dramatic, topical, warm, arousing, angry, scary, socially beneficial, cute, violent, sexy, uplifting, intriguing, quirky, interesting, authoritative, tear-jerking, educational, controversial or baby- and animal-filled. One of the reasons for the various views is that researchers have often looked at only popular videos and did not compare the popular clips with the content almost no one saw. To see if they could clarify some of the contradictions, the authors examined a mix of popular and unpopular videos, then systematically coded and empirically tested the effect of each element on some relatively objective and observational measures of viewer engagement. The authors assigned a team of research assistants to watch 750 videos and to independently score each on a range of attributes. Did the video feature babies, attempt to be funny or use sexually suggestive content? How would watching the video make the typical viewer feel? They collected information on dozens of different video elements and correlated these with three measures of engagement: the number of times people left comments on the video, the overall “liking” index for each video (calculated by subtracting the number of “dislikes” from “likes”) and the number of views. The authors’ key finding? Emotionally surprising videos generated liking and views more than any kind of specific content element they studied. The authors also looked at novel and incongruous content and found that both were associated with feelings of surprise, which increased views and liking. To get viewers’ attention by surprising them, marketers have two good choices: Show viewers something they have never seen before, or show them two things they are familiar with but in an original, juxtaposed way.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Marketing","Content Marketing"]},{"id":"53863MIT64306","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Become a Better Problem Solver by Telling Better Stories","authors":["Arnaud Chevallier","Albrecht Enders","Jean-Louis Barsoux"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"February 2023","description":"One of the biggest obstacles to effective problem-solving is not defining the problem well.

Succeeding with Sprint Goals covers everything you need to define, create, and execute on Sprint Goals that deliver outstanding value to customers and the business.\n\nLeading Scrum practitioner Maarten Dalmijn bridges the gap between theory and practice, offering a fresh, unique, and cohesive perspective on the Scrum framework that will be valuable to every Product Owner, Product Manager, Scrum Master, Agile coach, and technology executive. You will learn why Sprint Goals are so important, how to use them throughout the Sprint and at Review and Retrospective, how to overcome common obstacles to success, and how to use them to build high-performing teams.\n\nAs Dalmijn presents critical Scrum and product management fundamentals through the lens of the Sprint Goal, he helps you move your entire organization from low-value \"feature factories\" to high-value outcomes.\n\n...","tags":["Business","Human Resources","Reviews & Metrics","Goals"]},{"id":"9781119855286","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Advice for a Successful Career in the Accounting Profession","authors":["Jerry Maginnis"],"pages":"176","publication_date":"October 2021","description":"Practical guidance to optimize the benefits of your accounting degree—no matter what stage of your career!\n\nOriginally conceived and designed to provide helpful advice to college and university accounting majors and early-career professionals, this book evolved into a valuable resource for those groups as well as others who may be further along in their accounting careers.\n\nIt contains many practical examples and real-life experiences from a long and successful career in the profession that you won't find in any accounting, auditing, or tax textbook.

Many feel intimidated by the act of writing, and some don't enjoy writing. In Storytelling for Grantseekers, Second Edition, Cheryl Clarke presents an organic approach to grantseeking, one that views the process through the lens of the pleasures and rewards of crafting a good story. Grantseekers who approach the process as one in which they are connecting with an audience (grantmakers) and writing a narrative (complete with settings, characters, antagonists and resolutions) find greater success with funders. The writing process becomes a rewarding way to tell the organization's tale, rather than a chore, and their passion and creativity lead to winning proposals.\n\nThis book walks readers through all the main phases of the proposal, highlighting the creative elements that link components to each other and unify the entire proposal. The book contains resources on crafting an effective synopsis, overcoming grantwriter's block, packaging the story, and the best ways to approach the \"short stories\" (inquiry and cover letters) that support the larger proposal.\n\nClarke also stresses the need to see proposal-writing as part of a larger grantseeking effort, one that emphasizes preparation, working with the entire development staff, and maintaining good relations with funders.

According to standard personality testing assessments, most people are introverts and no group is more introverted than technical professionals. Introverts are congenitally programmed to recoil from the prospect of public speaking with fear and loathing, yet making presentations to expert and non-expert audiences is an inescapable requirement for career advancement in any technical field. Presentation coach Richard Tierney rides to the rescue of fellow introverts in the IT and engineering sectors with The Introverted Presenter—his fail-safe guide to delivering competent presentations, no matter how unsuited by nature you might be to the performing arts.\n\nThis short book lays out the complete process guaranteed to raise you from a debilitating state of terror and aversion to a comfortable place of clarity, calm, and competence—perhaps even brilliance, if you can train yourself to convert the free energy of your fear into controlled performance. Tierney repeatedly warns his introvert readers that they risk presentation fiasco if they skip, skimp, or change the order of any of the ten steps he prescribes for thoroughly and efficiently preparing their presentations.\n\nThe surefire sequence of steps for The Introverted Presenter begins with defining your presentation’s audience and objective. The next step is to write the script of your speech in stages, constructing it on the basis of proven structural rules, cognitive laws, and dramatic tricks. Then you incrementally refine and tighten your script by delivering it iteratively, first in front of a mirror and then in front of increasingly critical test audiences, progressing from your cat to your boss. When you have a well-constructed and sound-tested script in hand and only then, you may create some slides to graft into your script in support of your opening action call and your concluding takeaways, which you commit to memory. Your slides should be limited to the smallest number possible (even zero) and the fewest possible words.","tags":["Business","Project & Product Management","Product Management","Customer Experience"]},{"id":"9798868811401","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"The Language of Innovation: Transforming Ideas into Awesome Products","authors":["Ron Itelman"],"pages":"237","publication_date":"February 2025","description":"Transform how teams innovate together and turn your ideas into scalable solutions through practical implementation techniques.

Subsequent chapters cover individual markets and securities: repo, rate and bond forwards and futures, interest rate and basis swaps, credit markets, fixed income options, and mortgage-backed-securities.\n\nFixed Income Securities, Third Edition is full of examples, applications, and case studies.

Most examples have been updated. The chapters on fixed income options and mortgage-backed securities have been considerably expanded to include a broader range of securities and valuation methodologies. Also, three new chapters have been added: the global overview of fixed income markets; a chapter on corporate bonds and credit default swaps; and a chapter on discounting with bases, which is the foundation for the relatively recent practice of discounting swap cash flows with curves based on money market rates.\n\n[FOR THE UNIVERSITY EDITION]\n\nThis university edition includes problems which students can use to test and enhance their understanding of the text.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Financial Markets","Securities"]},{"id":"9781119858942","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Elite Sales Strategies","authors":["Anthony Iannarino"],"pages":"272","publication_date":"April 2022","description":"Accelerate your sales career with this how-to book from an expert in sales\n\nIn Elite Sales Strategies, expert sales leader Anthony Iannarino offers his philosophy about becoming a commercial success.

Digital monopolies like Google, Facebook and Amazon act as gatekeepers to the digital world. Amazon is capturing almost all online shopping dollars. We have the illusion of choice, but for most critical decisions, we have only one or two companies, when it comes to high speed Internet, health insurance, medical care, mortgage title insurance, social networks, Internet searches, or even consumer goods like toothpaste. Every day, the average American transfers a little of their pay check to monopolists and oligopolists. The solution is vigorous anti-trust enforcement to return America to a period where competition created higher economic growth, more jobs, higher wages and a level playing field for all. The Myth of Capitalism is the story of industrial concentration, but it matters to everyone, because the stakes could not be higher. It tackles the big questions of: why is the US becoming a more unequal society, why is economic growth anemic despite trillions of dollars of federal debt and money printing, why the number of start-ups has declined, and why are workers losing out.","tags":["Business","Economics"]},{"id":"9780132619165","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"The Option Trader’s Work Book: A Problem-Solving Approach, Second Edition","authors":["Jeff Augen"],"pages":"304","publication_date":"October 2011","description":"Successful options trading requires extensive practice.

Dutt"],"pages":"216","publication_date":"September 2021","description":"Iteration rules product development, but it isn't enough to produce dramatic results. This book champions Radical Product Thinking, a systematic methodology for building visionary, game-changing products.Methodologies such as Lean and Agile have democratized innovation by teaching us to harness the power of iteration to innovate faster, but our ability to set a clear destination hasn't kept up with the pace. When we iterate without a clear vision or strategy, our products become bloated, fragmented, and driven by irrelevant metrics. They catch “product diseases” that are often fatal to true innovation. In Radical Product Thinking (RPT), product development is led by the vision for the change it's intended to create. This methodology helps leaders reimagine the problems they face and align their team to find creative solutions using five elements: Vision, Strategy, Prioritization, Execution, and Culture. R. Dutt guides readers through these elements so they develop a clear process for achieving their desired change, incorporate it into daily activities, and turn RPT skills into muscle memory. This book gives organizations a repeatable model for building vision-driven products by helping us systematically translate vision and strategy into everyday actions so our product becomes a vehicle for creating the change we want to see in the world. Dutt shows us that you don't have to be a natural-born visionary to produce extraordinary results.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Strategic Thinking"]},{"id":"9781292142210","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Project Management: Step by Step, 2nd Edition","authors":["Richard Newton"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"August 2016","description":"You’ve been given a project to run.

Learn about the psychology of fraud victims, including boards of directors and senior management, and what makes them want to believe fraudsters, and therefore making them particularly vulnerable to deception. Just as IT experts gave us computer forensics, we now have a uniquely qualified team immersed in psychology, sociology, psychiatry as well as accounting and auditing, introducing the emerging field of behavioral forensics to address the phenomenon of fraud.\n\nEver wonder what makes a white-collar criminal tick? Why does she or he do what they do? For the first time ever, see the mind of the fraudster laid bare, including their sometimes twisted rationalizations; think like a crook to catch a crook! The A.B.C.'s of Behavioral Forensics takes you there, with expert advice from a diverse but highly specialized authoring team of professionals (three out of the four are Certified Fraud Examiners): a former accounting firm partner who has a PhD in psychology, a former FBI special agent who has been with investigative practices of two of the Big Four firms, an industrial psychiatrist who has worked closely with the C-level suite of large and small companies, and an accounting professor who has interviewed numerous convicted felons. Along with a fascinating exploration of what makes people fall for the common and not-so-common swindles, the book provides a sweeping characterization of the ecology of fraud using The A.B.C.'s of Behavioral Forensics paradigm: the bad Apple (rogue executive), the bad Bushel (groups that collude and behave like gangs), and the bad Crop (representing organization-wide or even societally-sanctioned cultures that are toxic and corrosive). The book will make you take a longer look when hiring new employees and offers a deeper more complex understanding of what happens in organizations and in their people. The A.B.C. model will also help those inside and outside organizations inoculate against fraud and make you reflect on instilling the core values of your organization among your people and create a culture of excellence and integrity that acts as a prophylactic against fraud. Ultimately, you will discover that, used wisely, behavioral methods trump solely economic incentives. With business fraud on the rise globally, The A.B.C.'s of Behavioral Forensics is the must-have book for investigators, auditors, the C-suite and risk management professionals, the boards of directors, regulators, and HR professionals.\n\nExamines the psychology of fraud in a practical way, relating it to aspects of fraud prevention, deterrence, detection, and remediation\n\nHelps you understand that trust violation—the essence of fraud—is a betrayal of behavioral assumptions about \"trusted\" people\n\nExplains how good people go bad and how otherwise honest people cross the line\n\nUnderscores the importance of creating a culture of excellence and integrity that inoculates an organization from fraud risk (i.e., honest behavior pays, while dishonesty is frowned upon)\n\nProvides key takeaways on what to look for when hiring new employees and in your current employees, as well as creating and maintaining a culture of control consciousness\n\nIncludes narrative accounts of interviews with convicted white-collar criminals, as well as interpretive insights and analysis of their rationalizations\n\nFurnishes ideas about how to enhance professional skepticism, how to resist fraudsters, how to see through their schemes, how to infuse internal controls with the people/behavioral element, and make them more effective in addressing behavioral/integrity risks\n\nProvides a solid foundation for training programs across the fraud risk management life cycle all the way from the discovery of fraud to its investigation as well as remediation (so the same fraud doesn't happen again)\n\nEnables auditors/investigators to engage in self-reflection and avoid cognitive and emotional biases and traps that lead to professional judgment errors (e.g., overconfidence, confirmation, self-deception, groupthink, halo effect, availability, speed-accuracy trade-off, etc.)\n\nEver since the accounting scandals surrounding Enron and WorldCom surfaced, leading to the passage of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, as well as the continuing fall out from the Wall Street financial crisis precipitating the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, fraud has been a leading concern for executives globally. If you thought you knew everything there was to know about financial fraud, think again.

Learn about the psychology of fraud victims, including boards of directors and senior management, and what makes them want to believe fraudsters, and therefore making them particularly vulnerable to deception. Just as IT experts gave us computer forensics, we now have a uniquely qualified team immersed in psychology, sociology, psychiatry as well as accounting and auditing, introducing the emerging field of behavioral forensics to address the phenomenon of fraud.\n\nEver wonder what makes a white-collar criminal tick? Why does she or he do what they do? For the first time ever, see the mind of the fraudster laid bare, including their sometimes twisted rationalizations; think like a crook to catch a crook! The A.B.C.'s of Behavioral Forensics takes you there, with expert advice from a diverse but highly specialized authoring team of professionals (three out of the four are Certified Fraud Examiners): a former accounting firm partner who has a PhD in psychology, a former FBI special agent who has been with investigative practices of two of the Big Four firms, an industrial psychiatrist who has worked closely with the C-level suite of large and small companies, and an accounting professor who has interviewed numerous convicted felons. Along with a fascinating exploration of what makes people fall for the common and not-so-common swindles, the book provides a sweeping characterization of the ecology of fraud using The A.B.C.'s of Behavioral Forensics paradigm: the bad Apple (rogue executive), the bad Bushel (groups that collude and behave like gangs), and the bad Crop (representing organization-wide or even societally-sanctioned cultures that are toxic and corrosive). The book will make you take a longer look when hiring new employees and offers a deeper more complex understanding of what happens in organizations and in their people. The A.B.C. model will also help those inside and outside organizations inoculate against fraud and make you reflect on instilling the core values of your organization among your people and create a culture of excellence and integrity that acts as a prophylactic against fraud. Ultimately, you will discover that, used wisely, behavioral methods trump solely economic incentives. With business fraud on the rise globally, The A.B.C.'s of Behavioral Forensics is the must-have book for investigators, auditors, the C-suite and risk management professionals, the boards of directors, regulators, and HR professionals.\n\nExamines the psychology of fraud in a practical way, relating it to aspects of fraud prevention, deterrence, detection, and remediation\n\nHelps you understand that trust violation—the essence of fraud—is a betrayal of behavioral assumptions about \"trusted\" people\n\nExplains how good people go bad and how otherwise honest people cross the line\n\nUnderscores the importance of creating a culture of excellence and integrity that inoculates an organization from fraud risk (i.e., honest behavior pays, while dishonesty is frowned upon)\n\nProvides key takeaways on what to look for when hiring new employees and in your current employees, as well as creating and maintaining a culture of control consciousness\n\nIncludes narrative accounts of interviews with convicted white-collar criminals, as well as interpretive insights and analysis of their rationalizations\n\nFurnishes ideas about how to enhance professional skepticism, how to resist fraudsters, how to see through their schemes, how to infuse internal controls with the people/behavioral element, and make them more effective in addressing behavioral/integrity risks\n\nProvides a solid foundation for training programs across the fraud risk management life cycle all the way from the discovery of fraud to its investigation as well as remediation (so the same fraud doesn't happen again)\n\nEnables auditors/investigators to engage in self-reflection and avoid cognitive and emotional biases and traps that lead to professional judgment errors (e.g., overconfidence, confirmation, self-deception, groupthink, halo effect, availability, speed-accuracy trade-off, etc.)\n\nEver since the accounting scandals surrounding Enron and WorldCom surfaced, leading to the passage of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, as well as the continuing fall out from the Wall Street financial crisis precipitating the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, fraud has been a leading concern for executives globally. If you thought you knew everything there was to know about financial fraud, think again.

Never have there been so many opportunities to inspire and influence in everyday situations -- elevator chats, corridor conversations, networking gatherings, meetings, and ceremonial events. Indeed, today the most iconic leadership moments are spontaneous, spur-of-the-moment events that reveal the inner workings of the leader's mind. When these impromptu opportunities arise, leaders must be able to listen, think, and respond within seconds. They don't read a script from a page, they convey the narrative that is already in their mind. They can tailor a message—in a meeting, in the corridor, or in a tweet—to influence and inspire any audience. Those who shine in that moment are remembered for their leadership. Those who stumble are remembered for their gaffes, mixed messages, or insensitivity. Nobody remembers the leaders who retreat to their office, formulate a strategic plan, and distribute a memo the following week.\n\nGuided by her entrepreneurial success as founder of The Humphrey Group and her firm's work with tens of thousands of leaders over the past 30 years, Judith Humphrey makes clear the importance of preparing to be spontaneous -- as counterintuitive as that may sound! Drawing upon the best impromptu moments from the Greeks to the present, the book looks at every aspect of impromptu speaking. You will learn how to:\n\nThink like an impromptu leader\nQuickly read an audience of one or a thousand\nCollect your thoughts and craft a persuasive message\n'Script' yourself within seconds for any occasion\nAvoid 'um's' and 'ah's' and use the right words at the right time\nDiscover improv techniques that will enable you to shine\nDeliver your message with clarity, confidence, and conviction.\n\nThe ability to speak on the spot is often seen as an innate gift, a talent of 'natural-born' leaders. The truth is, it's a skill that can be learned—a skill that is quickly becoming a must-have for anyone in a leadership position. Impromptu provides clear, actionable guidance to help you reach your full leadership potential. It will enable you to influence and inspire followers on the many 'small stages' that define our daily lives.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9780471788515","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Commodity Fundamentals: How to Trade the Precious Metals, Energy, Grain, and Tropical Commodity Markets","authors":["RONALD C.

Teamwork Is an Individual Skill shows readers how to develop the skills to thrive on any team, under any circumstances. No longer will readers find themselves complaining, \"I got assigned to a bad team.\" Instead, they'll know what to do to make any team work for them.Drawing on over twenty years of experience successfully developing professional teams in product development, R&D, and high-tech environments, Christopher Avery and his coauthors use brief thought-provoking essays, personal and teambuilding exercises, case studies, and insights from business leaders to teach readers how to build responsible and productive relationships at work. The authors show how and why your ability to assume personal responsibility-for your own work on a team and for the team's collective work-is the most important factor in ensuring a productive team experience.Teambuilding, the authors point out, is essentially a series of conversations between people who share responsibility to get something done. Teamwork Is an Individual Skill describes the way these conversations typically progress, and shows the reader how to predict and direct these conversations so that they can maximize the benefits to both themselves and to their team.Designed for easy access and for use by both individuals and groups, Teamwork Is an Individual Skill will equip readers with the mental skills and behaviors that will help them achieve personal goals while contributing to their team's success.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Team Management"]},{"id":"9781632650733","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"The Ultimate Start-Up Guide","authors":["Tom Hogan","Carol Broadbent"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"January 2016","description":"Most start-ups fail.

Hallowell, MD, the world’s leading expert on ADD and ADHD, has set his sights on a new goal: helping people feel more in control and productive at work.You know the feeling: you can’t focus; you feel increasingly overwhelmed by a mix of nonstop demands and technology that seems to be moving at the speed of light; and you’re frustrated just trying to get everything done well—and on time. Not only is this taking a toll on performance, it’s impacting your sense of well-being outside the office. It’s time to reclaim control.Dr. Hallowell now identifies the underlying reasons why people lose their ability to focus at work. He explains why commonly offered solutions like “learn to manage your time better” or “make a to-do list” don’t work because they ignore the deeper issues that are the true causes of mental distraction. Based on his years of helping clients develop constructive ways to deal with distraction, Dr. Hallowell provides a set of practical and reliable techniques to show how to sustain a productive mental state. In Part 1 of the book, he identifies the six most common ways people lose the ability to focus at work—what he calls “screen sucking” (internet/social media addiction), multitasking, idea hopping (never finishing what you start), worrying, playing the hero, and dropping the ball—and he explains the underlying psychological and emotional dynamics driving each behavior. Part 2 of the book provides advice for “training” your attention overall, so that you are less susceptible to surrendering it, in any situation. The result is a book that will empower you to combat each one of these common syndromes—and clear a path for you to achieve your highest personal and professional goals.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Development","Personal Productivity"]},{"id":"9780814415115","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"The Elements of Power","authors":["Terry R.

The author presents the theories of stochastic processes and stochastic calculus and provides the necessary tools for modeling and pricing in finance and insurance. Practical in focus, the book's emphasis is on application, intuition, and computation, rather than theory.\n\nConsequently, the text is of interest to graduate students, researchers, and practitioners interested in these areas. While the text is self-contained, an introductory course in probability theory is beneficial to prospective readers.\n\nThis book evolved from the author's experience as an instructor and has been thoroughly classroom-tested. Following an introduction, the author sets forth the fundamental information and tools needed by researchers and practitioners working in the financial and insurance industries:\n\nOverview of Probability Theory\n\nDiscrete-Time stochastic processes\n\nContinuous-time stochastic processes\n\nStochastic calculus: basic topics\n\nThe final two chapters, Stochastic Calculus: Advanced Topics and Applications in Insurance, are devoted to more advanced topics. Readers learn the Feynman-Kac formula, the Girsanov's theorem, and complex barrier hitting times distributions. Finally, readers discover how stochastic analysis and principles are applied in practice through two insurance examples: valuation of equity-linked annuities under a stochastic interest rate environment and calculation of reserves for universal life insurance.\n\nThroughout the text, figures and tables are used to help simplify complex theory and pro-cesses. An extensive bibliography opens up additional avenues of research to specialized topics.\n\nIdeal for upper-level undergraduate and graduate students, this text is recommended for one-semester courses in stochastic finance and calculus.

Although everyone talks about employee experience nobody has really been able to explain concretely what it is and how to go about designing for it...until now.\n\nHow can organizations truly create a place where employees want to show up to work versus need to show up to work? For decades the business world has focused on measuring employee engagement meanwhile global engagement scores remain at an all time low despite all the surveys and institutes that been springing up tackle this problem. Clearly something is not working. Employee engagement has become the short-term adrenaline shot that organizations turn to when they need to increase their engagement scores. Instead, we have to focus on designing employee experiences which is the long term organizational design that leads to engaged employees. This is the only long-term solution. Organizations have been stuck focusing on the cause instead of the effect. The cause is employee experience; the effect is an engaged workforce.\n\nBacked by an extensive research project that looked at over 150 studies and articles, featured extensive interviews with over 150 executives, and analyzed over 250 global organizations, this book clearly breaks down the three environments that make up every single employee experience at every organization around the world and how to design for them. These are the cultural, technological, and physical environments. This book explores the attributes that organizations need to focus on in each one of these environments to create COOL spaces, ACE technology, and a CELEBRATED culture. Featuring exclusive case studies, unique frameworks, and never before seen research, The Employee Experience Advantage guides readers on a journey of creating a place where people actually want to show up to work.\n\nReaders will learn:\n\nThe trends shaping employee experience\nHow to evaluate their own employee experience using the Employee Experience Score\nWhat the world's leading organizations are doing around employee experience\nHow to design for technology, culture, and physical spaces\nThe role people analytics place in employee experience\nFrameworks for how to actually create employee experiences\nThe role of the gig economy\nThe future of employee experience\nNine types of organizations that focus on employee experience\nAnd much more!\n\nThere is no question that engaged employees perform better, aspire higher, and achieve more, but you can't create employee engagement without designing employee experiences first. It's time to rethink your strategy and implement a real-world framework that focuses on how to create an organization where people want to show up to work. The Employee Experience Advantage shows you how to do just that.","tags":["Business","Human Resources","Talent Management"]},{"id":"9781119051787","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Pitch the Perfect Investment","authors":["Paul D.

Starting from a teaching and learning perspective, Hunt draws together ideas from psychodynamic psychotherapy, literary and learning theory, and work in the cognitive and neurosciences of the self and consciousness, to argue that creative life writing undertaken in a supportive learning environment, alongside opportunities for critical reflection, has the power to transform the way people think and learn. It does this by opening them up to a more embodied self-experience, which increases their awareness of the source of their thinking in bodily feeling and enables them to develop a more reflexive approach to learning.\n\nHunt locates this work within recent developments in the influential field of transformative learning. She also identifies it as a form of therapeutic education arguing, contrary to those who say that this approach leads to a diminished sense of self, that it can help people to develop a stronger sense of agency, whether for writing or learning or relations with others. Topics covered include:\n\n　\n\nCreative writing as a tool for personal and professional development\n\nThe transformative benefits and challenges of creative writing as a therapeutic activity\n\nThe relationships between literary structures and the processes of thinking and feeling\n\nThe role of cognitive-emotional learning in adult education\n\nCollaborative learning and the role of the group\n\n　\n\nThis book will interest teachers in adult, further and higher education who wish to use creative life writing as a tool for learning, as well as health care professionals seeking art-based techniques for use in their practice.

Many software architects see modular software based on microservices and service-oriented architecture (SOA) as the way forward, but the financial industry’s regulatory environment is a significant barrier to overcome.\n\nDownload this report and learn how FinTech startups are creating novel types of business models in Africa and Asia, where there are far fewer traditional banks, and in Europe and the US, where financial institutions generally avoid the market for small business loans.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","FinTech"]},{"id":"9781633691018","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Managing Oneself","authors":["Peter Ferdinand Drucker"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"January 2008","description":"We live in an age of unprecedented opportunity: with ambition, drive, and talent, you can rise to the top of your chosen profession regardless of where you started out. But with opportunity comes responsibility. Companies today aren't managing their knowledge workers careers. Instead, you must be your own chief executive officer. That means it's up to you to carve out your place in the world and know when to change course. And it's up to you to keep yourself engaged and productive during a career that may span some 50 years. In Managing Oneself, Peter Drucker explains how to do it. The keys: Cultivate a deep understanding of yourself by identifying your most valuable strengths and most dangerous weaknesses; Articulate how you learn and work with others and what your most deeply held values are; and Describe the type of work environment where you can make the greatest contribution. Only when you operate with a combination of your strengths and self-knowledge can you achieve true and lasting excellence. Managing Oneself identifies the probing questions you need to ask to gain the insights essential for taking charge of your career. Peter Drucker was a writer, teacher, and consultant. His 34 books have been published in more than 70 languages. He founded the Peter F. Drucker Foundation for Nonprofit Management, and counseled 13 governments, public services institutions, and major corporations.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Career Development"]},{"id":"9781118237397","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"The Indomitable Investor: Why a Few Succeed in the Stock Market When Everyone Else Fails","authors":["Steven M.

One day on their way to school, they have a nice conversation with their old family friend and youth soccer coach, Mr. Erwin, who shows them a special garden he created in his backyard. The garden serves as both a place and a metaphor for Mr. Erwin to share a powerful paradigm and practical strategies to help the twins overcome their fear, stress, and anxiety.\n\nThe Garden is an enlightening and encouraging spiritual fable that reveals the 5 D’s that can sabotage us and a proven plan to help us overcome and win the battle in our mind.

However, in his familiar trademark style, he takes a complex subject and simplifies it to help people take action and improve their lives.\n\nEveryone will struggle with fear, anxiety, or stress at some point in their lives, and everyone will have to overcome these challenges to create the life they were meant to live.
