You've picked exactly the right columns, you've got them in the ideal order, you've computed statistics, you've checked for null columns—and the optimizer flatly refuses to use your index unless you hint it. What could possibly be going wrong?\n\nIf you've suffered the frustration of watching the optimizer do something completely bizarre when the best execution plan is totally obvious, or spent hours or days trying to make the optimizer do what you want it to do, then this is the book you need. You'll come to know how the optimizer thinks, understand why it makes mistakes, and recognize the data patterns that make it go awry. With this information at your fingertips, you will save an enormous amount of time on designing and trouble-shooting your SQL.\n\nThe cost-based optimizer is simply a piece of code that contains a model of how Oracle databases work. By applying this model to the statistics about your data, the optimizer tries to efficiently convert your query into an executable plan. Unfortunately, the model can't be perfect, your statistics can't be perfect, and the resulting execution plan may be far from perfect.\n\nIn Cost-Based Oracle Fundamentals, the first book in a series of three, Jonathan Lewis—one of the foremost authorities in this field—describes the most commonly used parts of the model, what the optimizer does with your statistics, and why things go wrong.

Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI) is concerned with coordinated intelligent behavior: intelligent agents coordinating their knowledge, skills, and plans to act or solve problems, working toward a single goal, or toward separate, individual goals that interact. DAI provides intellectual insights about organization, interaction, and problem solving among intelligent agents. This comprehensive collection of articles shows the breadth and depth of DAI research. The selected information is relevant to emerging DAI technologies as well as to practical problems in artificial intelligence, distributed computing systems, and human-computer interaction.\n\n\"Readings in Distributed Artificial Intelligence\" proposes a framework for understanding the problems and possibilities of DAI. It divides the study into three realms: the natural systems approach (emulating strategies and representations people use to coordinate their activities), the engineering/science perspective (building automated, coordinated problem solvers for specific applications), and a third, hybrid approach that is useful in analyzing and developing mixed collections of machines and human agents working together.\n\nThe editors introduce the volume with an important survey of the motivations, research, and results of work in DAI.

From watching movies recommended by our entertainment streaming service, to interacting with customer service chatbots, to autotagging photos of friends in our social media apps, AI plays an invisible part in enriching our lives. While AI may be seen as a panacea for enterprise advancement and consumer convenience, it is still an emerging technology, and its explosive growth needs to be approached with proper care and preparation. How do we tackle the challenges it presents, and how do we make sure that it does precisely what it is supposed to do?\n\nIn Keeping Your AI Under Control, author Anand Tamboli explores the inherent risk factors of the widespread implementation of artificial intelligence. The author delves into several real-life case studies of AI gone wrong, including Microsoft’s 2016 chatbot disaster, Uber’s autonomous vehicle fatally wounding a pedestrian, and an entire smart home inGermany dangerously malfunctioning because of one bad lightbulb.

How can you filter streams of complex information to pull out only what you want? Why does it matter how information is structured when Google seems to magically bring up the right answer to your questions? What does it mean to be \"findable\" in this day and age? This eye-opening new book examines the convergence of information and connectivity. Written by Peter Morville, author of the groundbreaking Information Architecture for the World Wide Web, the book defines our current age as a state of unlimited findability. In other words, anyone can find anything at any time. Complete navigability.\n\nMorville discusses the Internet, GIS, and other network technologies that are coming together to make unlimited findability possible. He explores how the melding of these innovations impacts society, since Web access is now a standard requirement for successful people and businesses. But before he does that, Morville looks back at the history of wayfinding and human evolution, suggesting that our fear of being lost has driven us to create maps, charts, and now, the mobile Internet.\n\nThe book's central thesis is that information literacy, information architecture, and usability are all critical components of this new world order. Hand in hand with that is the contention that only by planning and designing the best possible software, devices, and Internet, will we be able to maintain this connectivity in the future. Morville's book is highlighted with full color illustrations and rich examples that bring his prose to life.\n\nAmbient Findability doesn't preach or pretend to know all the answers. Instead, it presents research, stories, and examples in support of its novel ideas. Are we truly at a critical point in our evolution where the quality of our digital networks will dictate how we behave as a species? Is findability indeed the primary key to a successful global marketplace in the 21st century and beyond. Peter Morville takes you on a thought-provoking tour of these memes and more -- ideas that will not only fascinate but will stir your creativity in practical ways that you can apply to your work immediately.\n\n\"A lively, enjoyable and informative tour of a topic that's only going to become more important.\"--David Weinberger, Author, Small Pieces Loosely Joined and The Cluetrain Manifesto\n\n\"I envy the young scholar who finds this inventive book, by whatever strange means are necessary.

Ambient Findability puts SEM into a broader context and provides deeper insights into human behavior. This book will help you grow your online business in a world where being found is not at all certain.\"--Jakob Nielsen, Ph.D., Author, Designing Web Usability: The Practice of Simplicity\n\n\"Information that's hard to find will remain information that's hardly found--from one of the fathers of the discipline of information architecture, and one of its most experienced practitioners, come penetrating observations on why findability is elusive and how the act of seeking changes us.\"--Steve Papa, Founder and Chairman, Endeca\n\n\"Whether it's a fact or a figure, a person or a place, Peter Morville knows how to make it findable. Morville explores the possibilities of a world where everything can always be found--and the challenges in getting there--in this wide-ranging, thought-provoking book.\"--Jesse James Garrett, Author, The Elements of User Experience\n\n\"It is easy to assume that current searching of the World Wide Web is the last word in finding and using information. Peter Morville shows us that search engines are just the beginning. Skillfully weaving together information science research with his own extensive experience, he develops for the reader a feeling for the near future when information is truly findable all around us. There are immense implications, and Morville's lively and humorous writing brings them home.\"--Marcia J.

The material will benefit those who want a better high-level understanding of databases such as proposal managers, architects, project managers, and even customers. The material will also benefit those who will actually design, build, and work with databases such as database designers, database administrators, and programmers. In many projects, these roles overlap so the same person may be responsible for working on the proposal, managing part of the project, and designing and creating the database.\n\nThis book is aimed at IT professionals and students of all experience levels.

You can apply the techniques described here equally to whatever database tool you use whether it's Access, SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, or some other database product.\n\nMost database products include free editions that you can use for smaller projects. For example, SQL Server Express Edition, Oracle Express Edition, and MySQL Community Server are all free.\n\nTo remain database neutral, the book does not assume you are using a particular database so you don't need any particular software or hardware. To work through the Exercises, all you really need is a pencil and some paper. You are welcome to type solutions into your computer if you like but you may actually find working with pencil and paper easier than using a graphical design tool to draw pictures, at least until you are comfortable with database design and are ready to pick a computerized design tool.\n\n\"Goals of Effective Database Design,\" explains the reasons why people and organizations use databases. It explains a database's purpose and conditions that it must satisfy to be useful. This also describes the basic ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) and CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) features that any good database should have. It explains in high-level general terms what makes a good database and what makes a bad database.\n\n\"Database Types,\" explains some of the different types of databases that you might decide to use. These include flat files, spreadsheets, hierarchical databases (XML), object databases, and relational databases. The relational database is one of the most powerful and most commonly used forms of database so it is the focus of this book, but it is important to realize that there are alternatives that may be more appropriate under certain circumstances. This gives some tips on deciding which kind of database might be best for a particular project.\n\n\"Relational Database Fundamentals,\" explains basic relational database concepts such as tables, rows, and columns. It explains the common usage of relational database terms in addition to the more technical terms that are sometimes used by database theorists. It describes different kinds of constraints that databases use to guarantee that the data is stored safely and consistently.\n\n\"Understanding User Needs,\" explains how to learn about the users' needs and gather user requirements. It tells how to study the users' current operations, existing databases (if any), and desired improvements. It describes common questions that you can ask to learn about users' operations, desires, and needs, and how to build the results into requirements documents and specifications. This explains what use cases are and tells how to use them and the requirements to guide database design and to measure success.\n\n\"Translating User Needs into Data Models,\" introduces data modeling. It explains how to translate the user's conceptual model and the requirements into other more precise models that define the database design rigorously. This describes several database modeling techniques including user-interface models, semantic object models, entity-relationship diagrams, and relational models.\n\n\"Extracting Business Rules,\" explains how a database can handle business rules. It explains what business rules are, how they differ from database structure requirements, and how you can identify business rules. This explains the benefits of separating business rules from the database structure and tells how achieve that separation.\n\n\"Normalizing Data,\" explains one of the biggest tools in database design: normalization. Normalization techniques allow you to restructure a database to increase its flexibility and make it more robust. This explains the various forms of normalization, emphasizing the stages that are most common and important: first, second, and third normal forms (1NF, 2NF, and 3NF). It explains how each of these kinds of normalization helps prevent errors and tells why it is sometimes better to leave a database slightly less normalized to improve performance.\n\n\"Designing Databases to Support Software Applications,\" explains how databases fit into the larger context of application design and lifecycle. This explains how later development depends on the underlying database design. It discusses multi-tier architectures that can help decouple the application and database design so there can be at least some changes to either without requiring changes to the other.\n\n\"Common Design Patterns,\" explains some common patterns that are useful in many applications. Some of these techniques include implementing various kinds of relationships among objects, storing hierarchical and network data, recording temporal data, and logging and locking.\n\n\"Common Design Pitfalls,\" explains some common design mistakes that occur in database development. It describes problems that can arise from insufficient planning, incorrect normalization, and obsession with ID fields and performance.\n\n\"User Needs and Requirements,\" walks through the steps required to analyze the users' problem, define requirements, and create use cases. It describes interviews with fictitious customers that are used to identify the application's needs and translate them into database requirements.\n\n\"Building a Data Model,\" translates the requirements gathered in the previous into a series of data models that precisely define the database's structure. This builds user-interface models, entity-relationship diagrams, semantic object models, and relational models to refine the database's initial design. The final relational models match the structure of a relational database fairly closely so they are easy to implement.\n\n\"Extracting Business Rules,\" identifies the business rules embedded in the relational model. It shows how to extract those rules in order to separate them logically from the database's structure. This makes the database more robust in the face of future changes to the business rules.\n\n\"Normalization and Refinement,\" refines the relational model by normalizing it. It walks through several versions of the database that are in different normal forms. It then selects the degree of normalization that provides a reasonable tradeoff between robust design and acceptable performance.\n\n\"Microsoft Access,\" explains how to build a database with Microsoft Access 2007. This explains enough to get started and to use Access to build non-trivial databases. You can use other versions of Access to work through this, although the locations of menus, buttons, and other Access features are different in different versions.\n\n\"MySQL,\" explains how to build a database with MySQL. This tells where to download a free version of MySQL. It explains how to use the MySQL Command Line Client as well as some useful graphical tools including MySQL Query Browser and MySQL Workbench.\n\n\"Introduction to SQL,\" provides an introduction to SQL (Structured Query Language). It explains how to use SQL commands to add, insert, update, and delete data. By using SQL, you can help insulate a program from the idiosyncrasies of the particular database product that it uses to store data.\n\n\"Building Databases with SQL Scripts,\" explains how to use SQL scripts to build a database. It explains the advantages of this technique, such as the ability to create scripts to initialize a database before performing tests. It also explains some of the restrictions on this method, such as the fact that the user must create and delete tables in specific orders to satisfy table relationships.\n\n\"Database Maintenance,\" describes some of the database maintenance issues that are part of any database application. Though performing and restoring backups, compressing tables, rebuilding indexes, and populating data warehouses are strictly not database design tasks, they are essential to any working application.\n\n\"Database Security,\" explains database security issues. It explains the kinds of security that some database products provide. It also explains some additional techniques that can enhance database security such as using database views to appropriately restrict the users' access to data.","tags":["Data","Data Engineering","Relational Databases"]},{"id":"9781118539835","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Encyclopedia of Financial Models III","authors":["Frank J.

McDonough"],"pages":"395","publication_date":"April 2021","description":"Write automated unit tests for the ABAP language. This book teaches programmers using simple examples and metaphors and explains the underlying concepts of writing effective automated unit tests. Many, if not most, ABAP programmers learned their programming and testing skills before the ABAP development environment provided an automated unit testing facility.  \n\nAutomated Unit Testing with ABAP: A Practical Approach offers hope and salvation to ABAP programmers who continue to toil with antiquated manual unit testing processes, taking them by the hand and lifting them out of that dungeon of despair with a modern and proven alternative. It begins by explaining how the xUnit family of automated testing frameworks provides a quick and effective means of insuring high-quality software. It then focuses on the ABAP Unit Testing Facility, the xUnit framework applicable specifically to the ABAP language, showing how it can be used to bring ABAP applications underautomated testing control, from old legacy applications to those newly written.\n\nWhereas xUnit testing has been widely accepted with developers writing in many other programming languages, it is an unfortunate fact in the ABAP community that many programmers still are unfamiliar with xUnit concepts and do not know how to begin implementing automated unit testing into their development process. This book demonstrates how to refactor programs so they become designed for testability, showing how to use process encapsulation and test isolation to facilitate automated testing, including a thorough explanation of test-driven development and the use of test doubles. The book:\n\nShows how to write automated unit tests for ABAP\nInstills ABAP programmers with the confidence to refactor poorly written code\nExplains how an automated testing harness facilitates rapid software development\nTeaches how to utilize test-driven development (TDD) withABAP\nOffers advice and tips on the best ways to write automated unit tests\n\nWhat You Will Learn\n\nBecome familiar with the xUnit approach to testing\nKnow the ABAP statements that interfere with running automated unit tests and how to accommodate them\nUnderstand what it means to isolate code for testing and how this is achieved\nGain the confidence to refactor poorly written code\nMake ABAP programs designed for testability\nReap the benefits of spending less time manually unit testing ABAP programs\nUse test-driven development (TDD) with ABAP programming\nUse configurable test doubles in ABAP\n\nWho This Book Is For\n\nABAP programmers who remain unfamiliar with the automated unit testing facility and those who already use it butwant to improve their skill writing and using automated tests. The book addresses the reluctance and trepidation felt by procedural ABAP programmers who need to know some object-oriented concepts to use this facility, expands their horizons, and helps them step through the doorway leading to a different approach to program design.","tags":["Data","Data Science","Data Science Tasks","A/B Testing"]},{"id":"9781484248911","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"MongoDB Recipes: With Data Modeling and Query Building Strategies","authors":["Subhashini Chellappan","Dharanitharan Ganesan"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"December 2019","description":"Get the most out of MongoDB using a problem-solution approach.

You’ll learn to measure performance and predict the specific impact of changes to your environment. You’ll know the limitations of the benchmarks and the crucial difference between benchmarking and workload capture/reply. \nThis book teaches you how to create empirical evidence in support of business and technology decisions. It’s about not guessing when you should be measuring. Empirical testing is scientific testing that delivers measurable results. Begin with a hypothesis about the impact of a possible architecture or technology change. Then run the appropriate benchmarks to gather data and predict whether the change you’re exploring will be beneficial, and by what order of magnitude. Stop guessing. Start measuring. Let Database Benchmarking and Stress Testing show the way.\nWhat You'll Learn\nUnderstand the industry-standard database benchmarks, and when each is best used\nPrepare for a database benchmarking effort so reliable results can be achieved\nPerform database benchmarking for consolidation, virtualization, and cloud projects\nRecognize and avoid common mistakes in benchmarking database performance\nMeasure and interpret results in a rational, concise manner for reliable comparisons\nChoose and provide advice on benchmarking tools based on their pros and cons\nWho This Book Is For\nDatabase administrators and professionals responsible for advising on architectural decisions such as whether to use cloud-based services, whether to consolidate and containerize, and who must make recommendations on storage or any other technology that impacts database performance","tags":["Data","Data Engineering","Database Architecture"]},{"id":"9781788294669","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Hands-On Chatbots and Conversational UI Development","authors":["Srini Janarthanam"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"December 2017","description":"Discover the world of bots and conversational user interfaces with 'Hands-On Chatbots and Conversational UI Development'.

Although few would characterize this technique as simple, regression is in fact both simple and elegant. The complexity that many attribute to regression analysis is often a reflection of their lack of familiarity with the language of mathematics. But regression analysis can be understood even without a mastery of sophisticated mathematical concepts. This book provides the foundation and will help demystify regression analysis using examples from economics and with real data to show the applications of the method. The concepts related to regression analysis are explained in a way that is comprehensible to those whose mathematical skills are not matching that of the expert level, and uses Microsoft Excel to obtain regression results. What hinders peoples’ comprehension of regression analysis is the difficulty many have in understanding mathematical symbols and derivations.

It provides world-class storage management with extreme scalability, flash accelerated performance, automatic policy-based storage that has tiers of flash through disk to tape. It also provides support for various protocols, such as NFS, SMB, Object, HDFS, and iSCSI. Containers can leverage the performance, information lifecycle management (ILM), scalability, and multisite data management to give the full flexibility on storage as they experience on the runtime.\n\nContainer adoption is increasing in all industries, and they sprawl across multiple nodes on a cluster. The effective management of containers is necessary because their number will probably reach a far greater number than virtual machines today. Kubernetes is the standard container management platform currently being used.\n\nData management is of ultimate importance, and often is forgotten because the first workloads containerized are ephemeral. For data management, many drivers with different specifications were available. A specification named Container Storage Interface (CSI) was created and is now adopted by all major Container Orchestrator Systems available.\n\nAlthough other container orchestration systems exist, Kubernetes became the standard framework for container management. It is a very flexible open source platform used as the base for most cloud providers and software companies' container orchestration systems.\n\nRed Hat OpenShift is one of the most reliable enterprise-grade container orchestration systems based on Kubernetes, designed and optimized to easily deploy web applications and services. OpenShift enables developers to focus on the code, while the platform takes care of all of the complex IT operations and processes.\n\nThis IBM Redbooks® publication describes how the CSI Driver for IBM file storage enables IBM Spectrum® Scale to be used as persistent storage for stateful applications running in Kubernetes clusters. Through the Container Storage Interface Driver for IBM file storage, Kubernetes persistent volumes (PVs) can be provisioned from IBM Spectrum Scale.

Last year, US companies spent over $165 Billion on training; while many training programs themselves provide valuable skills and concepts, even the best-designed programs are ineffective because the learned behaviors are not reinforced. Without reinforcement, learned information gets shuffled to the back of the mind in the \"nice to know\" file, never again to see the light of day. This book bridges the canyon between learning and doing by providing solid reinforcement strategies. Written by a former Olympic athlete and corporate training guru, this methodology works with human behavior rather than against it; you'll learn where traditional training methods fail, and how to fill those gaps with proven techniques that help training \"stick.\"\n\nThere's a difference between \"telling\" and \"teaching,\" and that difference is reinforcement. Learned skills and behaviors cannot be truly effective until they are engrained, and they can only become engrained through use, encouragement, and measureable progress.

In the experience economy, patients will shift to being empowered consumers who are active participants in their own care. Tailor explores this shift by creating a vision for a newly designed health care system that's focused on both sickness and wellness, and is driven by data and analytics. The new system seamlessly integrates health into our daily lives, and delivers care so uniquely personalized that no two people are provided identical treatments. Connected through data, everyone across the health care ecosystem, including clinicians, insurers, and researchers, will be able to meet individuals wherever they are in their health journey to reach the ultimate goal of keeping people healthy.\n\nThe patient revolution has just begun and an exciting journey awaits us.\n\nPraise for the patient revolution\n\n\"A full 50% of the US population has at least one chronic disease that requires ongoing monitoring and treatment. Our current health care system is woefully inadequate in providing these individuals with the treatment and support they need. This disparity can only be addressed through empowering patients to better care for themselves and giving providers better tools to care for their patients. Both of those solutions will require the development and application of novel technologies. In Krisa Tailor's book The Patient Revolution, a blueprint is articulated for how this could be achieved, culminating in a vision for a learning health system within 10 years.\"\n\n—Ricky Bloomfield, MD, Director, Mobile Technology Strategy; Assistant Professor, Duke Medicine\n\n\"In The Patient Revolution, Krisa Tailor astutely points out that 80% of health is impacted by factors outside of the health care system. Amazon unfortunately knows more about our patients than we do. The prescriptive analytics she describes will allow health care providers to use big data to optimize interventions at the level of the individual patient. The use of analytics will allow providers to improve quality, shape care coordination, and contain costs. Advanced analytics will lead to personalized care and ultimately empowered patients!\"\n\n—Linda Butler, MD, Vice President of Medical Affairs/Chief Medical Officer/Chief Medical Information Officer, Rex Healthcare\n\n\"The Patient Revolution provides a practical roadmap on how the industry can capture value by making health and care more personalized, anticipatory, and intuitive to patient needs.\"\n\n—Ash Damle, CEO, Lumiata\n\n\"Excellent read. For me, health care represents a unique economy—one focused on technology, but requiring a deep understanding of humanity. Ms. Tailor begins the exploration of how we provide care via the concepts of design thinking, asking how we might redesign care with an eye toward changing the experience. She does an excellent job deconstructing this from the patient experience. I look forward to a hopeful follow-up directed at changing the provider culture.\"\n\n—Alan Pitt, MD, Chief Medical Officer, Avizia\n\n\"Whether you're a health care provider looking to gain an understanding of the health care landscape, a health data scientist, or a seasoned business pro, you'll come away with a deeper, nuanced understanding of today's evolving health care system with this book.

Emphasis on apprenticeship (through hands-on case studies) and anecdotes (through real-life applications) are the tools that Peter J. Huber uses in this volume. Concern with specific statistical techniques is not of immediate value; rather, questions of strategy – when to use which technique – are employed. Central to the discussion is an understanding of the significance of massive (or robust) data sets, the implementation of languages, and the use of models. Each is sprinkled with an ample number of examples and case studies. Personal practices, various pitfalls, and existing controversies are presented when applicable.

Estimations of model parameters are now performed in a split second. For this reason, working through the identifications phase to find the correct model is unnecessary. Instead, several competing models can be estimated, and their fit can be compared instantaneously.\n\nConsequently, for time series analysis, most of the Box and Jenkins analysis process for univariate series is now obsolete. The former days of looking at cross-correlations and pre-whitening are over, because distributed lag models are easily fitted by an automatic lag identification method. The same goes for bivariate and even multivariate models, for which PROC VARMAX models are automatically fitted. For these models, other interesting variations arise: Subjects like Granger causality testing, feedback, equilibrium, cointegration, and error correction are easily addressed by PROC VARMAX.\n\nOne problem with multivariate modeling is that it includes many parameters, making parameterizations unstable. This instability can be compensated for by application of Bayesian methods, which are also incorporated in PROC VARMAX. Volatility modeling has now become a standard part of time series modeling, because of the popularity of GARCH models. Both univariate and multivariate GARCH models are supported by PROC VARMAX. This feature is especially interesting for financial analytics in which risk is a focus.\n\nThis book teaches with examples. Readers who are analyzing a time series for the first time will find PROC VARMAX easy to use; readers who know more advanced theoretical time series models will discover that PROC VARMAX is a useful tool for advanced model building.","tags":["Data","Data Science","Data Science Tasks","Statistics","Time Series"]},{"id":"0738494755","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Improving Business Performance Insight . . . with Business Intelligence and Business Process Management","authors":["Chuck Ballard","Ahmed Abdel-Hamid","Robert Frankus"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"August 2006","description":"In this IBM Redbooks publication, we describe and demonstrate how to implement enterprise performance insight.

And Who Are They Telling?\n\nWhen you use Google’s “free” services, you pay, big time–with personal information about yourself. Google is making a fortune on what it knows about you…and you may be shocked by just how much Google does know. Googling Security is the first book to reveal how Google’s vast information stockpiles could be used against you or your business–and what you can do to protect yourself.\n\nUnlike other books on Google hacking, this book covers information you disclose when using all of Google’s top applications, not just what savvy users can retrieve via Google’s search results. West Point computer science professor Greg Conti reveals the privacy implications of Gmail, Google Maps, Google Talk, Google Groups, Google Alerts, Google’s new mobile applications, and more. Drawing on his own advanced security research, Conti shows how Google’s databases can be used by others with bad intent, even if Google succeeds in its pledge of “don’t be evil.”\n\nUncover the trail of informational “bread crumbs” you leave when you use Google search\n\nHow Gmail could be used to track your personal network of friends, family, and acquaintances\n\nHow Google’s map and location tools could disclose the locations of your home, employer, family and friends, travel plans, and intentions\n\nHow the information stockpiles of Google and other online companies may be spilled, lost, taken, shared, or subpoenaed and later used for identity theft or even blackmail\n\nHow the Google AdSense and DoubleClick advertising services could track you around the Web\n\nHow to systematically reduce the personal information you expose or give away\n\nThis book is a wake-up call and a “how-to” self-defense manual: an indispensable resource for everyone, from private citizens to security professionals, who relies on Google.\n\nPreface xiii\n\nAcknowledgments xix\n\nAbout the Author xxi\n\nChapter 1: Googling 1\n\nChapter 2: Information Flows and Leakage 31\n\nChapter 3: Footprints, Fingerprints, and Connections 59\n\nChapter 4: Search 97\n\nChapter 5: Communications 139\n\nChapter 6: Mapping, Directions, and Imagery 177\n\nChapter 7: Advertising and Embedded Content 205\n\nChapter 8: Googlebot 239\n\nChapter 9: Countermeasures 259\n\nChapter 10: Conclusions and a Look to the Future 299\n\nIndex 317","tags":["Data","Data Engineering","Data Security & Privacy"]},{"id":"0738439649","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"IBM System Storage N series Software Guide","authors":["Roland Tretau","Christian Fey","Michael Klimes"],"pages":"634","publication_date":"July 2014","description":"Corporate workgroups, distributed enterprises, and small to medium-sized companies are increasingly seeking to network and consolidate storage to improve availability, share information, reduce costs, and protect and secure information.

Every time you visit a website, use a credit card, drive on the freeway, or go past a CCTV camera, you are logged and tracked.

But nobody seems to realize that this has already been happening for years, with firms such as Google capturing everything you type into a browser and selling it to the highest bidder. Apps take information about where you go, and your contact book details, harvest them and sell them on – and people just click the EULA without caring. No one is revealing the dirty secret that is the tech firms harvesting customers’ personal data and selling it for vast profits – and people are totally unaware of the dangers.\n\nYou: For Sale is for anyone who is concerned about what corporate and government invasion of privacy means now and down the road. The book sets the scene by spelling out exactly what most users of the Internet and smart phones are exposing themselves to via commonly used sites and apps such as facebook and Google, and then tells you what you can do to protect yourself. The book also covers legal and government issues as well as future trends.\n\nWith interviews of leading security experts, black market data traders, law enforcement and privacy groups, You: For Sale will help you view your personal data in a new light, and understand both its value, and its danger.\n\nProvides a clear picture of how companies and governments harvest and use personal data every time someone logs on\nDescribes exactly what these firms do with the data once they have it – and what you can do to stop it\nLearn about the dangers of unwittingly releasing private data to tech firms, including interviews with top security experts, black market data traders, law enforcement and privacy groups\nUnderstand the legal information and future trends that make this one of the most important issues today","tags":["Data","Data Engineering","Data Security & Privacy"]},{"id":"0735619204","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Microsoft® SQL Server™ 2000 High Availability","authors":["Allan Hirt","Cathan Cook","Kimberly Tripp"],"pages":"784","publication_date":"July 2003","description":"Ensuring 24/7 database availability is crucial to your company’s success.

It models relationships between inputs and outputs even when there are more predictors than observations. Using JMP statistical discovery software from SAS, Discovering Partial Least Squares with JMP explores PLS and positions it within the more general context of multivariate analysis.\n\nIan Cox and Marie Gaudard use a â€œlearning through doingâ€ style. This approach, coupled with the interactivity that JMP itself provides, allows you to actively engage with the content. Four complete case studies are presented, accompanied by data tables that are available for download. The detailed â€œhow toâ€ steps, together with the interpretation of the results, help to make this book unique.\n\nDiscovering Partial Least Squares with JMP is of interest to professionals engaged in continuing development, as well as to students and instructors in a formal academic setting. The content aligns well with topics covered in introductory courses on: psychometrics, customer relationship management, market research, consumer research, environmental studies, and chemometrics. The book can also function as a supplement to courses in multivariate statistics and to courses on statistical methods in biology, ecology, chemistry, and genomics.\n\nWhile the book is helpful and instructive to those who are using JMP, a knowledge of JMP is not required, and little or no prior statistical knowledge is necessary. By working through the introductory chapters and the case studies, you gain a deeper understanding of PLS and learn how to use JMP to perform PLS analyses in real-world situations.\n\nThis book motivates current and potential users of JMP to extend their analytical repertoire by embracing PLS. Dynamically interacting with JMP, you will develop confidence as you explore underlying concepts and work through the examples. The authors provide background and guidance to support and empower you on this journey.\n\nThis book is part of the SAS Press program.","tags":["Data","Data Science","Analytics Platforms","JMP"]},{"id":"9781098171407","language":"en","level":null,"title":"Normalizing Unicode Text to a Standard Representation","authors":["David Beazley"],"pages":"5","publication_date":"May 2024","description":"Build your knowledge of Python with this Shortcuts collection.

With the SAX2 API, developers have access to the information in XML documents as they are read, without imposing major memory constraints or a large code footprint. SAX2 is often used by other APIs \"under the covers\", and provides a foundation for processing and creating both XML and non-XML information. While generally considered the most efficient approach to handling XML document parsing, SAX2 also carries a significant learning curve. In SAX2, author David Brownell explores the many details of managing XML parsers, filtering the information those parsers return, generating your own SAX2 events to convert non-XML information to an XML form, and developing strategies for using event-based parsing in a variety of application scenarios. Created in a public process by the XML-Dev mailing list, the SAX2 API is compact and highly functional. SAX2 uses callbacks to report the information in an XML document as the document is read, allowing you to create your own program structures around the content of documents. No intermediary model of an entire XML document is necessary, and the mapping from XML structures to Java structures and back is straightforward. Both developers learning about SAX2 for the first time and developers returning for reference and advanced material about SAX2 will find useful information in this book. Chapters provide detailed explanations and examples of many different aspects of SAX2 development, while appendices provide a reference to the API and an explanation of the relationships between the SAX2 API and the XML Information Set. While the core of the API is quite approachable, many of its more advanced features are both obscure and powerful. You can use SAX2 to filter, modify, and restructure information in layers of processing which make it easy to reuse generic tools. SAX2 also has some significant limitations that applications need to address in their own ways. This new book gives you the detail and examples required to use SAX2 to its full potential, taking advantage of its power while avoiding its limitations.","tags":["Data","Data Engineering","Storage Formats","XML"]},{"id":"9780071746854","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Practical PowerPivot & DAX Formulas for Excel 2010","authors":["Art Tennick"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"September 2010","description":"250 + ready-to-use, powerful DAX formulas\n\nDevelop effective business intelligence (BI) solutions and drive faster, better decision making across your enterprise with help from an experienced database consultant and trainer.

The author has done an excellent job of covering the many topics that fall under the umbrella of computational biology for vaccine design, demonstrating an admirable command of subject matter in fields as disparate as object-oriented databases and regulation of T cell response. Simply put, it has just the right breadth and depth, and it reads well. In fact, readability is one of its virtues—making the book enticing and useful, all at once...\" Human Vaccines, 2010\n\n\"... This book has several strong points. Although there are many textbooks that deal with vaccinology, few attempts have been made to bring together descriptions of vaccines in history, basic bioinformatics, various computational solutions and challenges in vaccinology, detailed experimental methodologies, and cutting-edge technologies... This book may well serve as a first line of reference for all biologists and computer scientists...\" –Virology Journal, 2009\n\nVaccines have probably saved more lives and reduced suffering in a greater number of people than any other medical intervention in human history, succeeding in eradicating smallpox and significantly reducing the mortality and incidence of other diseases. However, with the emergence of diseases such as SARS and the threat of biological warfare, vaccination has once again become a topic of major interest in public health.\n\nVaccinology now has at its disposal an array of post-genomic approaches of great power. None has a more persuasive potential impact than the application of computational informatics to vaccine discovery; the recent expansion in genome data and the parallel increase in cheap computing power have placed the bioinformatics exploration of pathogen genomes centre stage for vaccine researchers.\n\nThis is the first book to address the area of bioinformatics as applied to rational vaccine design, discussing the ways in which bioinformatics can contribute to improved vaccine development by\n\nintroducing the subject of harnessing the mathematical and computing power inherent in bioinformatics to the study of vaccinology\n\nputting it into a historical and societal context, and\n\nexploring the scope of its methods and applications.\n\nBioinformatics for Vaccinology is a one-stop introduction to computational vaccinology. It will be of particular interest to bioinformaticians with an interest in immunology, as well as to immunologists, and other biologists who need to understand how advances in theoretical and computational immunobiology can transform their working practices.","tags":["Data","Data Science","Data Science Domains","Bioinformatics"]},{"id":"0596001193","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Programming Web Services with XML-RPC","authors":["Simon St. Laurent","Dave Winer","Joe Johnston"],"pages":"234","publication_date":"June 2001","description":"Have you ever needed to share processing between two or more computers running programs written in different languages on different operating systems? Or have you ever wanted to publish information on the Web so that programs other than browsers could work with it? XML-RPC, a system for remote procedure calls built on XML and the ubiquitous HTTP protocol, is the solution you've been looking for.Programming Web Services with XML-RPC introduces the simple but powerful capabilities of XML-RPC, which lets you connect programs running on different computers with a minimum of fuss, by wrapping procedure calls in XML and establishing simple pathways for calling functions. With XML-RPC, Java programs can talk to Perl scripts, which can talk to Python programs, ASP applications, and so on. You can provide access to procedure calls without having to worry about the system on the other end, so it's easy to create services that are available on the Web.XML-RPC isn't the only solution for web services; the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) is another much-hyped protocol for implementing web services. While XML-RPC provides fewer capabilities than SOAP, it also has far fewer interoperability problems and its capabilities and limitations are much better understood. XML-RPC is also stable, with over 30 implementations on a wide variety of platforms, so you can start doing real work with it immediately.Programming Web Services with XML-RPC covers the details of five XML-RPC implementations, so you can get started developing distributed applications in Java, Perl, Python, ASP, or PHP. The chapters on these implementations contain code examples that you can use as the basis for your own work. This book also provides in-depth coverage of the XML-RPC specification, which is helpful for low-level debugging of XML-RPC clients and servers. And if you want to build your own XML-RPC implementation for another environment, the detailed explanations in this book will serve as a foundation for that work.","tags":["Data","Data Engineering","Storage Formats","XML"]},{"id":"9781118539149","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Knight's Microsoft SQL Server 2012 Integration Services 24-Hour Trainer","authors":["Brian Knight","Devin Knight","Mike Davis"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"November 2012","description":"Book-and-video package gets novices up to speed on Microsoft SQL Server 2012\n\nIf you need a practical, hands-on introduction, especially to SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS), this book-and-video package from authority Brian Knight is the perfect solution.

The Accelerator is an integrated back-end component of Db2 for z/OS. Together, they provide a hybrid workload-optimized database management system that seamlessly manages queries that are found in transactional workloads to Db2 for z/OS and queries that are found in analytics applications to Accelerator. Each query runs in its optimal environment for maximum speed and cost efficiency.\n\nThe incremental update function of Db2 Analytics Accelerator for z/OS updates Accelerator-shadow tables continually. Changes to the data in original Db2 for z/OS tables are propagated to the corresponding target tables with a high frequency and a brief delay. Query results from Accelerator are always extracted from recent, close-to-real-time data.An incremental update capability that is called IBM InfoSphere® Change Data Capture (InfoSphere CDC) is provided by IBM InfoSphere Data Replication for z/OS up to Db2 Analytics Accelerator V7.5. Since then, an extra new replication protocol between Db2 for z/OS and Accelerator that is called IBM Integrated Synchronization was introduced. With Db2 Analytics Accelerator V7.5, customers can choose which one to use.\n\nIBM Integrated Synchronization is a built-in product feature that you use to set up incremental updates. It does not require InfoSphere CDC, which is bundled with IBM Db2 Analytics Accelerator.\n\nIn addition, IBM Integrated Synchronization has more advantages:\n\nSimplified administration, packaging, upgrades, and support.

Most customers now integrate business analytics with OLTP by running, for example, scoring functions from transactional context for real-time analytics or by applying machine-learning algorithms on enterprise data that is kept on the mainframe. As a result, IBM adds investment so clients can keep the complete lifecycle for data analysis, modeling, and scoring on z Systems control in a cost-efficient way, keeping the qualities of services in availability, security, reliability that z Systems solutions offer. Because of the changed architecture and tighter integration, IBM has shown, in a customer proof-of-concept, that a particular client was able to achieve an orders-of-magnitude improvement in performance, allowing that client’s data scientist to investigate the data in a more interactive process.\n\nOpen technologies, such as Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) can help customers update single components instead of being forced to replace everything at once. As a result, you have the possibility to combine your preferred tool for model generation (such as SAS Enterprise Miner or IBM SPSS® Modeler) with a different technology for model scoring (such as Zementis, a company focused on PMML scoring). IBM SPSS Modeler is a leading data mining workbench that can apply various algorithms in data preparation, cleansing, statistics, visualization, machine learning, and predictive analytics. It has over 20 years of experience and continued development, and is integrated with z Systems. With IBM DB2 Analytics Accelerator 5.1 and SPSS Modeler 17.1, the possibility exists to do the complete predictive model creation including data transformation within DB2 Analytics Accelerator. So, instead of moving the data to a distributed environment, algorithms can be pushed to the data, using cost-efficient DB2 Accelerator for the required resource-intensive operations.\n\nThis IBM Redbooks® publication explains the overall z Systems architecture, how the components can be installed and customized, how the new IBM DB2 Analytics Accelerator loader can help efficient data loading for z Systems data and external data, how in-database transformation, in-database modeling, and in-transactional real-time scoring can be used, and what other related technologies are available.\n\nThis book is intended for technical specialists and architects, and data scientists who want to use the technology on the z Systems platform. Most of the technologies described in this book require IBM DB2 for z/OS®. For acceleration of the data investigation, data transformation, and data modeling process, DB2 Analytics Accelerator is required. Most value can be archived if most of the data already resides on z Systems platforms, although adding external data (like from social sources) poses no problem at all.","tags":["Data","Data Engineering","IBM"]},{"id":"9780738459547","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"IBM TS7700 Series DS8000 Object Store User's Guide Version 2.0","authors":["Lourie Goodall","Rin Fujiwara"],"pages":"36","publication_date":"March 2021","description":"The IBM® TS7700 features a functional enhancement that allows for the TS7700 to act as an object store for transparent cloud tiering with IBM DS8000® (DS8K), DFSMShsm (HSM), and native DFSMSdss (DSS).

The routers provide improved scalability, security, and manageability by enabling devices in separate SAN fabrics to communicate without merging fabrics into a single, large SAN fabric. This capability enables clients to initially deploy separate SAN solutions at the departmental and data center levels. Then, clients can consolidate these separate solutions into large enterprise SAN solutions as their experience and requirements grow and change.\n\nAlternatively, multiprotocol routers can help to connect existing enterprise SANs for a variety of reasons. For instance, the introduction of Small Computer System Interface over IP (iSCSI) provides for the connection of low-end, low-cost hosts to enterprise SANs. The use of an Internet Protocol (IP) in the Fibre Channel (FC) environment provides for resource consolidation and disaster recovery planning over long distances.

Mobile advertising has seen triple-digit percentage growth each year since PricewaterhouseCoopers began capturing this data in 2010. Yet some people have doubts about the effectiveness and viability of mobile advertising and believe that apps are a better medium. Authors Glen L. Urban and Fareena Sultan think one of the most effective uses of mobile media will be apps that are designed to build trust. They call these “benevolent” apps because the apps’ value is not directly tied to selling products but rather to advancing consumers’ interests and helping them solve problems or make decisions.\n\nOne example is the Sea Tow app, offered by Sea Tow Service International, headquartered in Southold, New York, which provides emergency towing and rescue services for boaters in the United States, the Caribbean and Europe. The free app supports boaters’ navigation needs by providing information about local tide tables, detailed marine weather forecasts, GPS coordinates and bearing, and speed.\n\nUrban and Sultan observe that a growing number of organizations, including well-known companies, have come forth with their own benevolent apps in which selling products takes a backseat to providing information and gaining trust. The authors present findings from two studies (one at Liberty Mutual Insurance and the other at Suruga Bank in Japan) showing that benevolent mobile apps that try to help consumers in decision making can positively impact consumers’ perception of a brand, as well as their willingness to consider the brand and their preference for it.","tags":["Data","Data Engineering","Location Data"]},{"id":"0738497657","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"IBM eServer zSeries 990 Technical Guide","authors":["Bill White","Mario Almeida","Dick Jorna"],"pages":"278","publication_date":"May 2004","description":"The IBM Eserver zSeries® 990 scalable server provides major extensions to the existing zSeries architecture and capabilities.

Therefore, how do we, as information scientists, respond intellectually to what is happening in the world of information and knowledge development, given the context of new sociocultural and knowledge landscapes? Information Science as an Interscience poses many challenges both to information science, philosophy and to information practice, and only when information science is understood as an interscience that operates in a multifaceted way, will it be able to comply with these challenges. In the fulfilment of this task it needs to be accompanied by a philosophical approach that will take it beyond the merely critical and linear approach to scientific work. For this reason a critical philosophical approach is proposed that will be characterised by multiple styles of thinking and organised by a compositional inspiration. This initiative is carried by the conviction that information science will hereby be enabled to make contributions to significant knowledge inventions that may bring about a better world. Chapters focus on the rethinking of human thinking, our unique ability that enables us to cope with the world in which we live, in terms of the unique science with which we are involved. Subsequent chapters explore different approaches to the establishment of a new scientific spirit, the demands these developments pose for human thinking, for questions of method and the implications for information science regarding its proposed functioning as a nomad science in the context of information practice and information work. Final chapters highlight the proposed responsibility of focusing on information and inventiveness and new styles of information and knowledge work.\n\nfocuses on rethinking information science to achieve a constructive scientific approach\nprovides an alternative methodological approach in the study of information science\nshows how a change in scientific approach will have vast implications for the understanding and dissemination of knowledge\npresents the implications of a new approach for knowledge workers, and the dynamics of their work\nexplores the future of thinking about science, knowledge and its nature and the ethical implications","tags":["Data","Information Science"]},{"id":"9781787125162","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Hadoop: Data Processing and Modelling","authors":["Garry Turkington","Tanmay Deshpande","Sandeep Karanth"],"pages":"979","publication_date":"August 2016","description":"Unlock the power of your data with Hadoop 2.X ecosystem and its data warehousing techniques across large data sets\n\nAbout This Book\n\nConquer the mountain of data using Hadoop 2.X tools\nThe authors succeed in creating a context for Hadoop and its ecosystem\nHands-on examples and recipes giving the bigger picture and helping you to master Hadoop 2.X data processing platforms\nOvercome the challenging data processing problems using this exhaustive course with Hadoop 2.X\n\nWho This Book Is For\n\nThis course is for Java developers, who know scripting, wanting a career shift to Hadoop - Big Data segment of the IT industry.

See how the power of experiments works for you.\n\nWhen it comes to improving customer experiences, trying out new business models, or developing new products, even the most experienced managers often get it wrong. They discover that intuition, experience, and big data alone don't work. What does? Running disciplined business experiments. And what if companies roll out new products or introduce new customer experiences without running these experiments? They fly blind.\n\nThat's what Harvard Business School professor Stefan Thomke shows in this rigorously researched and eye-opening book. It guides you through best practices in business experimentation, illustrates how these practices work at leading companies, and answers some fundamental questions: What makes a good experiment? How do you test in online and brick-and-mortar businesses? In B2B and B2C? How do you build an experimentation culture? Also, best practice means running many experiments. Indeed, some hugely successful companies, such as Amazon, Booking.com, and Microsoft, run tens of thousands of controlled experiments annually, engaging millions of users. Thomke shows us how these and many other organizations prove that experimentation provides significant competitive advantage.\n\nHow can managers create this capability at their own companies? Essential is developing an experimentation organization that prizes the science of testing and puts the discipline of experimentation at the center of its innovation process. While it once took companies years to develop the tools for such large-scale experiments, advances in technology have put these tools at the fingertips of almost any business professional. By combining the power of software and the rigor of controlled experiments, today's managers can make better decisions, create magical customer experiences, and generate big financial returns.\n\nExperimentation Works is your guidebook to a truly new way of thinking and innovating.","tags":["Data","Data Science"]},{"id":"9781119816799","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"IoT-enabled Smart Healthcare Systems, Services and Applications","authors":["Shalli Rani","Maheswar Rajagopal","Neeraj Kumar"],"pages":"256","publication_date":"January 2022","description":">IoT-Enabled Smart Healthcare Systems, Services and Applications\n\nExplore the latest healthcare applications of cutting-edge technologies\n\nIn IoT-Enabled Smart Healthcare Systems, Services and Applications, an accomplished team of researchers delivers an insightful and comprehensive exploration of the roles played by cutting-edge technologies in modern healthcare delivery.

For solving complex calculations and presenting results, Excel is amazingly complete with every imaginable feature already in place. But programming Excel isn't about adding new features as much as it's about combining existing features to solve particular problems. With a few modifications, you can transform Excel into a task-specific piece of software that will quickly and precisely serve your needs. In other words, Excel is an ideal platform for probably millions of small spreadsheet-based software solutions.\n\nThe best part is, you can program Excel with no additional tools. A variant of the Visual Basic programming language, VB for Applications (VBA) is built into Excel to facilitate its use as a platform. With VBA, you can create macros and templates, manipulate user interface features such as menus and toolbars, and work with custom user forms or dialog boxes. VBA is relatively easy to use, but if you've never programmed before, Programming Excel with VBA and .NET is a great way to learn a lot very quickly. If you're an experienced Excel user or a Visual Basic programmer, you'll pick up a lot of valuable new tricks. Developers looking forward to .NET development will also find discussion of how the Excel object model works with .NET tools, including Visual Studio Tools for Office (VSTO).\n\nThis book teaches you how to use Excel VBA by explaining concepts clearly and concisely in plain English, and provides plenty of downloadable samples so you can learn by doing. You'll be exposed to a wide range of tasks most commonly performed with Excel, arranged into chapters according to subject, with those subjects corresponding to one or more Excel objects. With both the samples and important reference information for each object included right in the chapters, instead of tucked away in separate sections, Programming Excel with VBA and .NET covers the entire Excel object library. For those just starting out, it also lays down the basic rules common to all programming languages.\n\nWith this single-source reference and how-to guide, you'll learn to use the complete range of Excel programming tasks to solve problems, no matter what you're experience level.","tags":["Data","Spreadsheets","Microsoft Excel"]},{"id":"9781953329189","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Getting Started with SAS Programming","authors":["Ron Cody"],"pages":"316","publication_date":"February 2021","description":"Get up and running with SAS using Ron Cody’s easy-to-follow, step-by-step guide.\n\nAimed at beginners, Getting Started with SAS Programming: Using SAS Studio in the Cloud uses short examples to teach SAS programming from the basics to more advanced topics in the point-and-click interactive environment of SAS Studio.

That something else can be an HTML document, another XML document, a Portable Document Format (PDF) file, a Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) file, a Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML) file, Java code, or a number of other things. You write an XSLT stylesheet to define the rules for transforming an XML document, and the XSLT processor does the work.As useful as XSLT is, its peculiar characteristics make it a difficult language in which to get started. In fact, newcomers are often a little dazed on first contact. Learning XSLT offers a hands-on introduction to help them get up to speed with XSLT quickly. The book will help web developers and designers understand this powerful but often mystifying template-driven and functional-styled language, getting them over the many differences between XSLT and the more conventional programming languages.Learning XSLT moves smoothly from the simple to complex, illustrating all aspects of XSLT 1.0 through step-by-step examples that you'll practice as you work through the book. Thorough in its coverage of the language, the book makes few assumptions about what you may already know. You'll learn about XSLT's template-based syntax, how XSLT templates work with each other, and gain an understanding of XSLT variables. Learning XSLT also explains how the XML Path Language (XPath) is used by XSLT and provides a glimpse of what the future holds for XSLT 2.0 and XPath 2.0.The ability to transform one XML vocabulary to another is fundamental to exploiting the power of XML. Learning XSLT is a carefully paced, example-rich introduction to XSLT that will have you understanding and using XSLT on your own in no time.","tags":["Data","Data Engineering","Storage Formats","XML"]},{"id":"9781484211120","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Oracle RMAN Database Duplication","authors":["Darl Kuhn"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"February 2015","description":"RMAN is Oracle’s flagship backup and recovery tool, but did you know it’s also an effective database duplication tool?

Microsoft’s BI toolset has undergone significant changes in the SQL Server 2005 development cycle. SQL Server 2005 is the first viable, full-functioned data warehouse and business intelligence platform to be offered at a price that will make data warehousing and business intelligence available to a broad set of organizations. This book is meant to offer practical techniques to guide those organizations through the myriad of challenges to true success as measured by contribution to business value.\n\nBuilding a data warehousing and business intelligence system is a complex business and engineering effort. While there are significant technical challenges to overcome in successfully deploying a data warehouse, the authors find that the most common reason for data warehouse project failure is insufficient focus on the business users and business problems. In an effort to help people gain success, this book takes the proven Business Dimensional Lifecycle approach first described in best selling The Data Warehouse Lifecycle Toolkit and applies it to the Microsoft SQL Server 2005 tool set.\n\nBeginning with a thorough description of how to gather business requirements, the book then works through the details of creating the target dimensional model, setting up the data warehouse infrastructure, creating the relational atomic database, creating the analysis services databases, designing and building the standard report set, implementing security, dealing with metadata, managing ongoing maintenance and growing the DW/BI system. All of these steps tie back to the business requirements. Each chapter describes the practical steps in the context of the SQL Server 2005 platform.\n\nIntended Audience\n\nThe target audience for this book is the IT department or service provider (consultant) who is:\n\nPlanning a small to mid-range data warehouse project;\n\nEvaluating or planning to use Microsoft technologies as the primary or exclusive data warehouse server technology;\n\nFamiliar with the general concepts of data warehousing and business intelligence.\n\nThe book will be directed primarily at the project leader and the warehouse developers, although everyone involved with a data warehouse project will find the book useful. Some of the book’s content will be more technical than the typical project leader will need; other chapters and sections will focus on business issues that are interesting to a database administrator or programmer as guiding information.\n\nThe book is focused on the mass market, where the volume of data in a single application or data mart is less than 500 GB of raw data. While the book does discuss issues around handling larger warehouses in the Microsoft environment, it is not exclusively, or even primarily, concerned with the unusual challenges of extremely large datasets.\n\nAbout the Authors\n\nJOY MUNDY has focused on data warehousing and business intelligence since the early 1990s, specializing in business requirements analysis, dimensional modeling, and business intelligence systems architecture. Joy co-founded InfoDynamics LLC, a data warehouse consulting firm, then joined Microsoft WebTV to develop closed-loop analytic applications and a packaged data warehouse.\n\nBefore returning to consulting with the Kimball Group in 2004, Joy worked in Microsoft SQL Server product development, managing a team that developed the best practices for building business intelligence systems on the Microsoft platform. Joy began her career as a business analyst in banking and finance. She graduated from Tufts University with a BA in Economics, and from Stanford with an MS in Engineering Economic Systems.\n\nWARREN THORNTHWAITE has been building data warehousing and business intelligence systems since 1980. Warren worked at Metaphor for eight years, where he managed the consulting organization and implemented many major data warehouse systems. After Metaphor, Warren managed the enterprise-wide data warehouse development at Stanford University. He then co-founded InfoDynamics LLC, a data warehouse consulting firm, with his co-author, Joy Mundy. Warren joined up with WebTV to help build a world class, multi-terabyte customer focused data warehouse before returning to consulting with the Kimball Group. In addition to designing data warehouses for a range of industries, Warren speaks at major industry conferences and for leading vendors, and is a long-time instructor for Kimball University. Warren holds an MBA in Decision Sciences from the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, and a BA in Communications Studies from the University of Michigan.\n\nRALPH KIMBALL, PH.D., has been a leading visionary in the data warehouse industry since 1982 and is one of today's most internationally well-known authors, speakers, consultants, and teachers on data warehousing.

Usually software is purchased by a centralized procurement function, and is either purchased on a project-by-project basis or as a large periodic software contract.\n\nUnfortunately purchasing software products does not automatically mean that these products are exploited throughout the organization providing the maximum possible value to the business units. Several issues call for a structured approach that gets the most business value out of software already purchased. The objectives of this approach are to:\n\n* Create maximum awareness throughout the organization of the software purchased. * Track software use in IT projects and act if products are not used at all, used improperly, or insufficiently used. * Facilitate use of software products in projects, especially when software products are complex and require a lot of integration.\n\nWe can summarize the overall objective of this approach as ensuring that the business units in an organization obtain the maximum possible value of software products purchased, which is also the scope of this IBM Redbooks publication.","tags":["Data","Data Engineering","IBM"]},{"id":"9780132724784","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"IBM Cognos Business Intelligence v10: The Complete Guide","authors":["Sangeeta Gautam"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"November 2012","description":"Maximize the Value of Business Intelligence with IBM Cognos v10 -- Hands-on, from Start to Finish This easy-to-use, hands-on guide brings together all the information and insight you need to drive maximum business value from IBM Cognos v10.

The current direction in the Business Intelligence marketplace is towards data mart consolidation. Originally data marts were built for many different reasons, such as departmental or organizational control, faster query response times, easier and faster to design and build, and fast payback.\n\nHowever, data marts did not always provide the best solution when it came to viewing the business enterprise as a whole. They provide benefits to the department or organization to whom they belong, but typically do not give management the information they need to efficiently and effectively run the business.\n\nIn many cases the data marts led to the creation of departmental or organizational data silos (non-integrated sources of data). That is, information was available to the particular department or organization, but was not integrated across all the department’s or organizations. Worse yet, many data marts were built without concern for the others. This led to inconsistent definitions of the data, inconsistent collection of data, inconsistent collection times for the data, and so on. The result was an inconsistent picture of the business for management, and an inability for good business performance management.

Human error, privilege misuse, and cyberespionage are considered the top insider threats. One of the most dangerous internal security threats is the privileged user with access to critical data, which is the \"crown jewels\" of the organization. This data is on storage, so storage administration has critical privilege access that can cause major security breaches and jeopardize the safety of sensitive assets. Organizations must maintain tight control over whom they grant privileged identity status to for storage administration. Extra storage administration access must be shared with support and services teams when required. There also is a need to audit critical resource access that is required by compliance to standards and regulations.\n\nIBM® Security™ Verify Privilege Vault On-Premises (Verify Privilege Vault), formerly known as IBM Security™ Secret Server, is the next-generation privileged account management that integrates with IBM Storage to ensure that access to IBM Storage administration sessions is secure and monitored in real time with required recording for audit and compliance. Privilege access to storage administration sessions is centrally managed, and each session can be timebound with remote monitoring. You also can use remote termination and an approval workflow for the session. In this IBM Redpaper, we demonstrate the integration of IBM Spectrum® Scale and IBM Elastic Storage® Server (IBM ESS) with Verify Privilege Vault, and show how to use privileged access management (PAM) for secure storage administration.\n\nThis paper is targeted at storage and security administrators, storage and security architects, and chief information security officers.","tags":["Data","Data Engineering","IBM"]},{"id":"0596007892","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"MySQL in a Nutshell","authors":["Russell J.

Lacity","Leslie P. Willcocks"],"pages":"9","publication_date":"October 2016","description":"For years, managers have, in effect, been trying to get humans to act like robots by structuring, routinizing, and measuring work -- all under the guise of organizational efficiency. Automation software that is being developed today enables a reversal of this process; it allows companies to use software robots to amplify and augment distinctive human strengths, and in the process it enables large economic gains and more satisfying work.\n\nAlthough the term “robot” connotes visions of electromechanical machines that perform human tasks, the term as it relates to service automation refers to something less threatening: software that performs repetitive and dreary service tasks previously performed by humans, so that humans can focus on more unstructured and interesting tasks.\n\nIn this article, authors Mary C. Lacity and Leslie P. Willcocks focus on “robotic process automation” -- software tools and platforms that deal with structured data, rules-based processes, and deterministic outcomes. They focus on this area (as opposed to more advanced automation technology known as “cognitive automation”) because this is where most companies begin their service automation journeys. Currently, companies use robotic process automation for tasks such as those associated with validating the sale of insurance premiums, generating utility bills, paying health care insurance claims, keeping employee records up-to-date, and even generating news stories.\n\nIn one case, the authors describe how a business process and technology services provider helped an insurance industry client automate a multistep process for processing premiums for new insurance policies. Humans still handle the unstructured parts of the work. However, the structured parts of the process, including finding errors, retrieving the online data, creating the official sales record, and notifying insurance brokers when the process is complete, are now managed by the robotic process automation software.\n\nBy studying organizations that were early adopters in deploying software robots, the authors were able to identify three ways the companies generated tangible benefits: (1) by developing an approach to service automation supported by top management; (2) by initiating effective processes that deliver value to customers and employees; and (3) by building enterprisewide skills and capabilities. The authors found that business operations groups tend to be in the best position to select tasks that are most suitable for automation and to prioritize automation projects that will yield the best outcomes for customers and employees. However, IT can be an important contributor to the success of automation programs. The authors also found that companies that captured the full benefits of service automation had a long-term view.","tags":["Data","AI & ML","Artificial Intelligence (AI)"]},{"id":"9781119866169","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Net Zeros and Ones","authors":["Richard Stiennon","Russ B.

Is it truly valuable to support decision-making ? What kind of decision can be truly supported and how can I handle residual uncertainty ? How much refined should the mathematical description be, given the true data limitations ? Could the uncertainty be reduced through more data, increased modeling investment or computational budget ? Should it be reduced now or later ? How robust is the analysis or the computational methods involved ? Should / could those methods be more robust ? Does it make sense to handle uncertainty, risk, lack of knowledge, variability or errors altogether ? How reasonable is the choice of probabilistic modeling for rare events ? How rare are the events to be considered ? How far does it make sense to handle extreme events and elaborate confidence figures ? Can I take advantage of expert / phenomenological knowledge to tighten the probabilistic figures ? Are there connex domains that could provide models or inspiration for my problem ?\n\nWritten by a leader at the crossroads of industry, academia and engineering, and based on decades of multi-disciplinary field experience, Modelling Under Risk and Uncertainty gives a self-consistent introduction to the methods involved by any type of modeling development acknowledging the inevitable uncertainty and associated risks. It goes beyond the \"black-box\" view that some analysts, modelers, risk experts or statisticians develop on the underlying phenomenology of the environmental or industrial processes, without valuing enough their physical properties and inner modelling potential nor challenging the practical plausibility of mathematical hypotheses; conversely it is also to attract environmental or engineering modellers to better handle model confidence issues through finer statistical and risk analysis material taking advantage of advanced scientific computing, to face new regulations departing from deterministic design or support robust decision-making.\n\nModelling Under Risk and Uncertainty:\n\nAddresses a concern of growing interest for large industries, environmentalists or analysts: robust modeling for decision-making in complex systems.\n\nGives new insights into the peculiar mathematical and computational challenges generated by recent industrial safety or environmental control analysis for rare events.\n\nImplements decision theory choices differentiating or aggregating the dimensions of risk/aleatory and epistemic uncertainty through a consistent multi-disciplinary set of statistical estimation, physical modelling, robust computation and risk analysis.\n\nProvides an original review of the advanced inverse probabilistic approaches for model identification, calibration or data assimilation, key to digest fast-growing multi-physical data acquisition.\n\nIllustrated with one favourite pedagogical example crossing natural risk, engineering and economics, developed throughout the book to facilitate the reading and understanding.\n\nSupports Master/PhD-level course as well as advanced tutorials for professional training\n\nAnalysts and researchers in numerical modeling, applied statistics, scientific computing, reliability, advanced engineering, natural risk or environmental science will benefit from this book.","tags":["Data","Data Science","Data Science Tasks","Statistics"]},{"id":"9789332537231","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Concept Of Database Management System by Pearson","authors":["Shefali Naik"],"pages":"259","publication_date":"May 2024","description":"Concepts of Database Management System is designed to meet the syllabi requirements of undergraduate students of computer applications and computer science.

Configured as emulated Fixed Block Architecture (FBA) disks, z/VM 5.1 can use FCP-attached disks for its system paging, spooling, directory, and minidisks.\n\nz/VM 5.1 adds new functions for Virtual Switches (VSWITCH). For increased network security, guests must have authorization before connecting to a VSWITCH. z/VM 5.1 introduces VSWITCH Layer 2 support. Operating at Layer 2, a VSWITCH delivers and receives network traffic in Ethernet frames. This provides the ability to handle non-IP protocols such as SNA, NetBIOS, and IPX. In addition, Layer 2 support reduces network latency and CPU overhead.","tags":["Data","Data Engineering","IBM"]},{"id":"9781484215982","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Pro MongoDB™ Development","authors":["Deepak Vohra"],"pages":"504","publication_date":"September 2015","description":"Pro MongoDB Development is a critical reference for anyone using MongoDB, a NoSQL database based on the BSON (binary JSON) document model.

These investments have been primarily focused on the development and deployment of single systems, applications, functions, and geographies targeted at the automation and optimization of key business processes. Companies are now investing heavily in big data analytics ($44 billion alone in 2014) in an effort to begin analyzing all of the data being generated from their process automation systems. But companies are quickly realizing that one of their key bottlenecks is Data Variety—the silo’d nature of the data that is a natural result of internal and external source proliferation. The problem of big data variety has crept up from the bottom—and the cost of variety is only appreciated when companies attempt to ask simple questions across many business silos (divisions, geographies, functions, etc.). Current top-down, deterministic data unification approaches (such as ETL, ELT, and MDM) were simply not designed to scale to the variety of hundreds or thousands or even tens of thousands of data silos. Download this free eBook to learn about the fundamental challenges that Data Variety poses to enterprises looking to maximize the value of their existing investments—and how new approaches promise to help organizations embrace and leverage the fundamental diversity of data. Readers will also find best practices for designing bottom-up and probabilistic methods for finding and managing data; principles for doing data science at scale in the big data era; preparing and unifying data in ways that complement existing systems; optimizing data warehousing; and how to use “data ops” to automate large-scale integration.","tags":["Data","Data Engineering"]},{"id":"0642572052867","language":"en","level":"Intermediate","title":"Setting Up Your Environment","authors":["George Mount"],"publication_date":"June 2024","description":"This series will equip learners with various techniques for efficient data manipulation, crucial for optimizing analysis workflows.

Usually software is purchased by a centralized procurement function, and is either purchased on a project-by-project basis or as a large periodic software contract.\n\nUnfortunately purchasing software products does not automatically mean that these products are exploited throughout the organization providing the maximum possible value to the business units. Several issues call for a structured approach that gets the most business value out of software already purchased. The objectives of this approach are to:\n\n* Create maximum awareness throughout the organization of the software purchased. * Track software use in IT projects and act if products are not used at all, used improperly, or insufficiently used. * Facilitate use of software products in projects, especially when software products are complex and require a lot of integration.\n\nWe can summarize the overall objective of this approach as ensuring that the business units in an organization obtain the maximum possible value of software products purchased, which is also the scope of this IBM Redbooks publication.","tags":["Data","Data Engineering","IBM"]},{"id":"9781783280933","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Introduction to R for Quantitative Finance","authors":["Gergely Daróczi","Michael Phule","Edina Berlinger (EURO)"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"November 2013","description":"Explore how to use the statistical computing language R to solve complex quantitative finance problems with \"Introduction to R for Quantitative Finance.\" This book offers a blend of theory and practice, empowering readers with both the foundational understanding and practical skills to tackle real-world challenges using R, making it an ideal resource for beginners and seasoned professionals alike.\n\nWhat this Book will help me do\n\nUtilize time series analysis in R to model and forecast financial and economic data.\nApply key portfolio selection theories to analyze and optimize investment portfolios.\nUnderstand and implement a variety of pricing models, including the Capital Asset Pricing Model in R.\nAnalyze and interpret fixed income instruments and derivatives, focusing on practical applications in finance.\nLeverage R for risk analysis through techniques such as Extreme Value Theory and copula-based modeling.\n\nAuthor(s)\n\nThe authors of \"Introduction to R for Quantitative Finance\" are seasoned experts in the fields of quantitative finance and computational statistics.

Human error, privilege misuse, and cyberespionage are considered the top insider threats. One of the most dangerous internal security threats is the privileged user with access to critical data, which is the \"crown jewels\" of the organization. This data is on storage, so storage administration has critical privilege access that can cause major security breaches and jeopardize the safety of sensitive assets. Organizations must maintain tight control over whom they grant privileged identity status to for storage administration. Extra storage administration access must be shared with support and services teams when required. There also is a need to audit critical resource access that is required by compliance to standards and regulations.\n\nIBM® Security™ Verify Privilege Vault On-Premises (Verify Privilege Vault), formerly known as IBM Security™ Secret Server, is the next-generation privileged account management that integrates with IBM Storage to ensure that access to IBM Storage administration sessions is secure and monitored in real time with required recording for audit and compliance. Privilege access to storage administration sessions is centrally managed, and each session can be timebound with remote monitoring. You also can use remote termination and an approval workflow for the session. In this IBM Redpaper, we demonstrate the integration of IBM Spectrum® Scale and IBM Elastic Storage® Server (IBM ESS) with Verify Privilege Vault, and show how to use privileged access management (PAM) for secure storage administration.\n\nThis paper is targeted at storage and security administrators, storage and security architects, and chief information security officers.","tags":["Data","Data Engineering","IBM"]},{"id":"9780124080805","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Accelerating MATLAB with GPU Computing","authors":["Jung W.

Originally data marts were built for many different reasons, such as departmental or organizational control, faster query response times, easier and faster to design and build, and fast payback.\n\nHowever, data marts did not always provide the best solution when it came to viewing the business enterprise as a whole. They provide benefits to the department or organization to whom they belong, but typically do not give management the information they need to efficiently and effectively run the business.\n\nIn many cases the data marts led to the creation of departmental or organizational data silos (non-integrated sources of data). That is, information was available to the particular department or organization, but was not integrated across all the department’s or organizations. Worse yet, many data marts were built without concern for the others. This led to inconsistent definitions of the data, inconsistent collection of data, inconsistent collection times for the data, and so on.

Lacity","Leslie P. Willcocks"],"pages":"9","publication_date":"October 2016","description":"For years, managers have, in effect, been trying to get humans to act like robots by structuring, routinizing, and measuring work -- all under the guise of organizational efficiency. Automation software that is being developed today enables a reversal of this process; it allows companies to use software robots to amplify and augment distinctive human strengths, and in the process it enables large economic gains and more satisfying work.\n\nAlthough the term “robot” connotes visions of electromechanical machines that perform human tasks, the term as it relates to service automation refers to something less threatening: software that performs repetitive and dreary service tasks previously performed by humans, so that humans can focus on more unstructured and interesting tasks.\n\nIn this article, authors Mary C. Lacity and Leslie P. Willcocks focus on “robotic process automation” -- software tools and platforms that deal with structured data, rules-based processes, and deterministic outcomes. They focus on this area (as opposed to more advanced automation technology known as “cognitive automation”) because this is where most companies begin their service automation journeys. Currently, companies use robotic process automation for tasks such as those associated with validating the sale of insurance premiums, generating utility bills, paying health care insurance claims, keeping employee records up-to-date, and even generating news stories.\n\nIn one case, the authors describe how a business process and technology services provider helped an insurance industry client automate a multistep process for processing premiums for new insurance policies. Humans still handle the unstructured parts of the work. However, the structured parts of the process, including finding errors, retrieving the online data, creating the official sales record, and notifying insurance brokers when the process is complete, are now managed by the robotic process automation software.\n\nBy studying organizations that were early adopters in deploying software robots, the authors were able to identify three ways the companies generated tangible benefits: (1) by developing an approach to service automation supported by top management; (2) by initiating effective processes that deliver value to customers and employees; and (3) by building enterprisewide skills and capabilities. The authors found that business operations groups tend to be in the best position to select tasks that are most suitable for automation and to prioritize automation projects that will yield the best outcomes for customers and employees. However, IT can be an important contributor to the success of automation programs. The authors also found that companies that captured the full benefits of service automation had a long-term view.","tags":["Data","AI & ML","Artificial Intelligence (AI)"]},{"id":"9781398605862","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Organizational Planning and Analysis","authors":["Rupert Morrison"],"pages":"440","publication_date":"September 2022","description":"Use this practical guide to take a data-driven approach to workforce planning and continuously analyse the organization to allow the business to meet its strategic objectives.","tags":["Data","Data Science","Analytics Platforms"]},{"id":"53863MIT66301","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Generate Value From GenAI With ‘Small t’ Transformations","authors":["Melissa Webster","George Westerman"],"pages":"9","publication_date":"January 2025","description":"Generative AI may not yet be capable of large-scale transformation, but companies are getting real business value today by targeting three transformation categories with varying degrees of risk: tasks across roles, role- and team-specific tasks, and products and customer-facing experiences.

Over the last couple of years, XML has become the de facto standard to exchange information between organizations, as well as between departments or applications within the same organization. Since data tends to live in databases, it needs to be converted from a relational format into an XML format when involved in those data exchanges, as well as converted (back) from XML into a relational format for storage, or for handling by other applications.\n\nHow can we achieve this? This IBM Redbooks publication describes how to design the mapping between XML and relational data, and vice versa, to enable a flexible exchange of information.\n\nIBM provides a number of products to help you bridge the gap between XML and its relational database, DB2. The DB2 engine itself provides support to generate XML fragments from relational data through the use of SQL/XML built-in functions. DB2 also provides the DB2 XML Extender. It allows you to perform XML composition, like SQL/XML, but also provides functionality to decompose XML documents and store XML documents intact inside the database. XML Extender also provides a set of transformation and validation functions. Another option to work with XML is to use the XML wrapper, a part of the set of non-relational wrappers of DB2 Information Integrator. This book also looks at the IBM tools available to assist you when dealing with XML, specifically WebSphere Application Developer and DB2 Control Center.

These investments have been primarily focused on the development and deployment of single systems, applications, functions, and geographies targeted at the automation and optimization of key business processes. Companies are now investing heavily in big data analytics ($44 billion alone in 2014) in an effort to begin analyzing all of the data being generated from their process automation systems. But companies are quickly realizing that one of their key bottlenecks is Data Variety—the silo’d nature of the data that is a natural result of internal and external source proliferation. The problem of big data variety has crept up from the bottom—and the cost of variety is only appreciated when companies attempt to ask simple questions across many business silos (divisions, geographies, functions, etc.). Current top-down, deterministic data unification approaches (such as ETL, ELT, and MDM) were simply not designed to scale to the variety of hundreds or thousands or even tens of thousands of data silos.

The groundwork for the modern committee theory was laid in the mid-1960s, when it was shown that the familiar notion of solution to a feasible system of linear inequalities has ingenious analogues which can serve as collective solutions to infeasible systems. A hierarchy of dialects in the language of mathematics, for instance, open cones in the context of linear inequality systems, regions of hyperplane arrangements, and maximal covectors (or topes) of oriented matroids, provides an excellent opportunity to take a fresh look at the infeasible system of homogeneous strict linear inequalities – the standard working model for the contradictory two-class pattern recognition problem in its geometric setting. The universal language of oriented matroid theory considerably simplifies a structural and enumerative analysis of applied aspects of the infeasibility phenomenon.\n\nThe present book is devoted to several selected topics in the emerging theory of pattern recognition on oriented matroids: the questions of existence and applicability of matroidal generalizations of committee decision rules and related graph-theoretic constructions to oriented matroids with very weak restrictions on their structural properties; a study (in which, in particular, interesting subsequences of the Farey sequence appear naturally) of the hierarchy of the corresponding tope committees; a description of the three-tope committees that are the most attractive approximation to the notion of solution to an infeasible system of linear constraints; an application of convexity in oriented matroids as well as blocker constructions in combinatorial optimization and in poset theory to enumerative problems on tope committees; an attempt to clarify how elementary changes (one-element reorientations) in an oriented matroid affect the family of its tope committees; a discrete Fourier analysis of the important family of critical tope committees through rank and distance relations in the tope poset and the tope graph; the characterization of a key combinatorial role played by the symmetric cycles in hypercube graphs.\n\nContentsOriented Matroids, the Pattern Recognition Problem, and Tope CommitteesBoolean IntervalsDehn–Sommerville Type RelationsFarey SubsequencesBlocking Sets of Set Families, and Absolute Blocking Constructions in PosetsCommittees of Set Families, and Relative Blocking Constructions in PosetsLayers of Tope CommitteesThree-Tope CommitteesHalfspaces, Convex Sets, and Tope CommitteesTope Committees and Reorientations of Oriented MatroidsTopes and Critical CommitteesCritical Committees and Distance SignalsSymmetric Cycles in the Hypercube Graphs","tags":["Data","AI & ML","Machine Learning","Machine Learning Methods","Pattern Recognition"]},{"id":"9783111049700","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Loss Data Analysis, 2nd Edition","authors":["Henryk Gzyl","Silvia Mayoral","Erika Gomes-Gonçalves"],"pages":"222","publication_date":"March 2023","description":"This volume deals with two complementary topics.

Originally developed by Netscape in 1999, RSS (which can stand for RDF Site Summary, Rich Site Summary, or Really Simple Syndication) is an XML-based format that allows web developers to describe and syndicate web site content. Using RSS files allows developers to create a data feed that supplies headlines, links, and article summaries from a web site. Other sites can then incorporate them into their pages automatically. Although RSS is in widespread use, people struggle with its confusing and sometimes conflicting documentation and versions. Content Syndication with RSS is the first book to provide a comprehensive reference to the specifications and the tools that make syndication possible. Content Syndication with RSS offers webloggers, developers, and the programmers who support them a thorough explanation of syndication in general and RSS in particular. Written for web developers who want to offer XML-based feeds of their content, as well as developers who want to use the content that other people are syndicating, the book explores and explains metadata interpretation, different forms of content syndication, and the increasing use of web services in this field. This concise volume begins with an introduction to content syndication on the Internet: its purpose, limitations, and traditions, and answers the question of why would you consider \"giving your content away\" like this? Next, the book delves into the architecture of content syndication with an overview of the entire system, from content author to end user on another site. You'll follow the flow of data: content, referral data, publish-and-subscribe calls, with a detailed look at the protocols and standards possible at each step. Topics covered in the book include:\n\nCreating XML syndication feeds with RSS 0.9x and 2.0\n\nBeyond headlines: creating richer feeds with RSS 1.0 and RDF metadata\n\nUsing feeds to enrich a site or find information\n\nPublish and subscribe: intelligent updating\n\nNews aggregators, such as Meerkat, Syndic8, and Newsisfree, and their web services\n\nAlternative industry-centric standards\n\nIf you're interested in producing your own RSS feed, this step-by-step guide to implementation is the book you'll want in hand.","tags":["Data","Data Engineering","Storage Formats","XML"]},{"id":"9781492094388","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"AI and Analytics at Scale","authors":["Ted Dunning","Ellen Friedman"],"pages":"101","publication_date":"January 2021","description":"Getting large-scale data-driven applications for AI and analytics into production doesn't have to be challenging.

Should we subcontract or employ more people? What will consumer demand be in the future? They need to be able to assess the value of data and to detect what is and what isn’t spin.\n\nThe focus is on analysing numbers. On their own, figures tell us very little. To become meaningful they need to be processed and analysed and it is the patterns that emerge from this that provide the information that is needed for decision-making.\n\nThe book is arranged in four themes. It starts by considering the value of information in organisations and by assessing how effectively the information is used in a management role. It then goes on to look at different options for presenting figures so that trends become clearer and patterns simpler to spot. As well as making data easier to interpret, the techniques the book presents are valuable communication tools that will help the reader use information more effectively with others.\n\nThe last two themes then provide a toolkit of techniques that you can use to investigate situations and help solve problems. These include statistical and operational techniques as well as computer tools. Like any toolkit, the key to using it properly lies in knowing not only what each tool does but when to use it.

Virtually every choice we make hinges on how someone generates data . . . and how someone else interprets it--whether we realize it or not.\n\nWhere do you send your child for the best education? Big Data. Which airline should you choose to ensure a timely arrival? Big Data. Who will you vote for in the next election? Big Data.\n\nThe problem is, the more data we have, the more difficult it is to interpret it. From world leaders to average citizens, everyone is prone to making critical decisions based on poor data interpretations.\n\nIn Numbersense, expert statistician Kaiser Fung explains when you should accept the conclusions of the Big Data \"experts\"--and when you should say, \"Wait . . . what?\" He delves deeply into a wide range of topics, offering the answers to important questions, such as:\n\nHow does the college ranking system really work?\nCan an obesity measure solve America's biggest healthcare crisis?\nShould you trust current unemployment data issued by the government?\nHow do you improve your fantasy sports team?\nShould you worry about businesses that track your data?\n\nDon't take for granted statements made in the media, by our leaders, or even by your best friend. We're on information overload today, and there's a lot of bad information out there.\n\nNumbersense gives you the insight into how Big Data interpretation works--and how it too often doesn't work. You won't come away with the skills of a professional statistician. But you will have a keen understanding of the data traps even the best statisticians can fall into, and you'll trust the mental alarm that goes off in your head when something just doesn't seem to add up.\n\nPraise for Numbersense\n\n\"Numbersense correctly puts the emphasis not on the size of big data, but on the analysis of it. Lots of fun stories, plenty of lessons learned—in short, a great way to acquire your own sense of numbers!\"Thomas H. Davenport, coauthor of Competing on Analytics and President’s Distinguished Professor of IT and Management, Babson College\n\n\"Kaiser’s accessible business book will blow your mind like no other. You’ll be smarter, and you won’t even realize it. Buy. It. Now.\"Avinash Kaushik, Digital Marketing Evangelist, Google, and author, Web Analytics 2.0\n\n\"Each story in Numbersense goes deep into what you have to think about before you trust the numbers. Kaiser Fung ably demonstrates that it takes skill and resourcefulness to make the numbers confess their meaning.\"John Sall, Executive Vice President, SAS Institute\n\n\"Kaiser Fung breaks the bad news—a ton more data is no panacea—but then has got your back, revealing the pitfalls of analysis with stimulating stories from the front lines of business, politics, health care, government, and education.

In highly accessible and always fun prose, it explores all the nooks and crannies of the digital universe, exploring not only how this exploding space works but also what it means.”\n\n–Debora Spar, President of Barnard College, Author of Ruling the Waves and The Baby Business\n\n \n\n“This is a wonderful book–probably the best since Hal Varian and Carl Schultz wrote Digital Rules. The authors are engineers, not economists. The result is a long, friendly talk with the genie, out of the lamp, and willing to help you avoid making the traditional mistake with that all-important third wish.”\n\n–David Warsh, Author of Knowledge and the Wealth of Nations\n\n \n\n“Blown to Bits is one of the clearest expositions I’ve seen of the social and political issues arising from the Internet.

What a pleasure to see real teachers offering such excellent framework for students in a digital age to explore and understand their digital environment, code and law, starting with the insight of Claude Shannon. I look forward to you teaching in an open online school.”\n\n–Professor Charles Nesson, Harvard Law School, Founder, Berkman Center for Internet and Society\n\n \n\n“To many of us, computers and the Internet are magic. We make stuff, send stuff, receive stuff, and buy stuff. It’s all pointing, clicking, copying, and pasting. But it’s all mysterious. This book explains in clear and comprehensive terms how all this gear on my desk works and why we should pay close attention to these revolutionary changes in our lives. It’s a brilliant and necessary work for consumers, citizens, and students of all ages.”\n\n–Siva Vaidhyanathan, cultural historian and media scholar at the University of Virginia and author of Copyrights and Copywrongs: The Rise of Intellectual Property and How it Threatens Creativity\n\n \n\n“The world has turned into the proverbial elephant and we the blind men. The old and the young among us risk being controlled by, rather than in control of, events and technologies. Blown to Bits is a remarkable and essential Rosetta Stone for beginning to figure out how all of the pieces of the new world we have just begun to enter–law, technology, culture, information–are going to fit together. Will life explode with new possibilities, or contract under pressure of new horrors? The precipice is both exhilarating and frightening. Hal Abelson, Ken Ledeen, and Harry Lewis, together, have ably managed to describe the elephant. Readers of this compact book describing the beginning stages of a vast human adventure will be one jump ahead, for they will have a framework on which to hang new pieces that will continue to appear with remarkable speed. To say that this is a ‘must read’ sounds trite, but, this time, it’s absolutely true.”\n\n–Harvey Silverglate, criminal defense and civil liberties lawyer and writer\n\n \n\nEvery day, billions of photographs, news stories, songs, X-rays, TV shows, phone calls, and emails are being scattered around the world as sequences of zeroes and ones: bits. We can’t escape this explosion of digital information and few of us want to–the benefits are too seductive. The technology has enabled unprecedented innovation, collaboration, entertainment, and democratic participation.\n\n \n\nBut the same engineering marvels are shattering centuries-old assumptions about privacy, identity, free expression, and personal control as more and more details of our lives are captured as digital data.\n\n \n\nCan you control who sees all that personal information about you? Can email be truly confidential, when nothing seems to be private? Shouldn’t the Internet be censored the way radio and TV are? Is it really a federal crime to download music? When you use Google or Yahoo! to search for something, how do they decide which sites to show you? Do you still have free speech in the digital world? Do you have a voice in shaping government or corporate policies about any of this?\n\n \n\nBlown to Bits offers provocative answers to these questions and tells intriguing real-life stories.

Since 1988, a considerable amount of work has been done in investigating computing capabilities of neural networks and understanding their relevance to providing efficient solutions for outstanding complex problems of the electric power industry. A principal objective of a power utility is to provide electric energy to its customers in a secure, reliable and economic manner. Toward this aim, utility personnel are engaged in a variety of activities in areas of supervisory control and monitoring, evaluation of operating conditions, operation planning and scheduling, system development, equipment testing, etc. Over the past decades significant advances have been made in the development of new concepts, design of hardware and software systems, and implementation of solid-state devices which all contributed to the steadily improving power system performance that we are experiencing today. Advanced information processing technologies played an important role in these development efforts. Members of the Special Interest Group for Power Engineering of the INNS recognized the need for bringing together leading researchers in the field of neurocomputing with experts from power utilities and manufacturing companies to assess the current state of affairs and to explore the directions of further research and practice.

Not only this, but in this cost-conscious environment of today, the costs of managing this growth are likely to be eating into the IT budget.\n\nOne way to make better use of existing storage without adding more complexity to the infrastructure is the IBM System Storage® SAN Volume Controller (SVC). For many years now this has helped business become more flexible, agile, and introduced an extremely efficient storage environment. SAN Volume Controller is designed to deliver the benefits of storage virtualization in environments from large enterprises to small businesses and midmarket companies.\n\nVirtualizing storage with SAN Volume Controller helps make new and existing storage more effective. SAN Volume Controller includes many functions that are traditionally deployed separately in disk systems. By including these in a virtualization system, SAN Volume Controller standardizes functions across virtualized storage for greater flexibility and potentially lower costs.\n\nNow, with IBM FlashSystem™ storage, SAN Volume Controller is enabled to extend its reach and benefit all virtualized storage. For example, IBM Easy Tier® optimizes use of flash storage. And IBM Real-time Compression™ enhances efficiency even further by enabling the storage of up to five times as much active primary data in the same physical disk space.\n\nIn this IBM Redbooks® publication, we show how to integrate the IBM FlashSystem 820 to provide storage to the SAN Volume Controller, and show how they are designed to operate seamlessly together, reducing management effort.\n\nIn this book, which is aimed at pre- and post-sales support, storage administrators, and people that want to get an overview of this new and exciting technology, we show the steps required to implement the IBM FlashSystem 820 in an existing SAN Volume Controller environment. We also highlight some of the new features in SAN Volume Controller that increase performance.\n\nIf you are not already familiar with the SAN Volume Controller, it is beneficial to read the following IBM Redbooks publications:- Implementing the IBM System Storage SAN Volume Controller V6.3, SG24-7933- Implementing the IBM Storwize V7000 V6.3, SG24-7938- Real-time Compression in SAN Volume Controller and Storwize V7000, REDP-4859- IBM SAN Volume Controller and IBM FlashSystem 820: Best Practices and Performance Capabilities, REDP-5027- IBM FlashSystem 710 and IBM FlashSystem 810, TIPS1002- IBM FlashSystem 720 and IBM FlashSystem 820, TIPS1003- Flash or SSD: Why and When to Use IBM FlashSystem, REDP-5020","tags":["Data","Data Engineering","IBM"]},{"id":"0738489654","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The IBM Virtualization Engine TS7510: Getting Started with i5/OS and Backup Recovery and Media Services","authors":["Jim Cook","Jana Jamsek","Dan Johansson"],"pages":"336","publication_date":"March 2007","description":"This IBM Redbooks publication provides a getting started level of information about supporting the IBM Virtualization Engine TS7510 under i5/OS, primarily using the Backup Recovery and Media Services (BRMS), 5722-BR1, management product.

The TS7700 supported off loading to physical tape for over two decades. Off loading to physical tape behind a TS7700 is utilized by hundreds of organizations around the world.\n\nBy using the same hierarchical storage techniques, the TS7700 (TS7770 and TS7760) can also off load to object storage. Because object storage is cloud-based and accessible from different regions, the TS7700 Cloud Storage Tier support essentially allows the cloud to be an extension of the grid. As of this writing, the TS7700C supports the ability to off load to IBM Cloud® Object Storage and Amazon S3.\n\nThis publication explains features and concepts that are specific to the IBM TS7700 as of release R5.1. The R5.1 microcode level provides IBM TS7700 Cloud Storage Tier enhancements, IBM DS8000® Object Storage enhancements, Management Interface dual control security, and other smaller enhancements. The R5.1 microcode level can be installed on the IBM TS7770 and IBM TS7760 models only.TS7700 provides tape virtualization for the IBM z environment. Tape virtualization can help satisfy the following requirements in a data processing environment:\n\nImproved reliability and resiliency\nReduction in the time that is needed for the backup and restore process\nReduction of services downtime that is caused by physical tape drive and library outages\nReduction in cost, time, and complexity by moving primary workloads to virtual tape\nIncreased efficient procedures for managing daily batch, backup, recall, and restore processing\nOn-premises and off-premises object store cloud storage support as an alternative to physical tape for archive and disaster recovery\nNew and existing capabilities of the TS7700 5.1 include the following highlights:\nEight-way Grid Cloud, which consists of up to three generations of TS7700\nSynchronous and asynchronous replication\nFull AES256 encryption for replication data that is in-flight and at-rest\nTight integration with IBM Z and DFSMS policy management\nOptional target for DS8000 Transparent Cloud Tier using DFSMS\nDS8000 Object Store AES256 in-flight encryption and compression\nOptional Cloud Storage Tier support for archive and disaster recovery\n16 Gb IBM FICON® throughput up to 5 GBps per TS7700 cluster\nIBM Z hosts view up to 3,968 common devices per TS7700 grid\nGrid access to all data independent of where it exists\nTS7770 Cache On-demand feature that is based capacity licensing\nTS7770 support of SSD within the VED server\nThe TS7700T writes data by policy to physical tape through attachment to high-capacity, high-performance IBM TS1150, and IBM TS1140 tape drives that are installed in an IBM TS4500 or TS3500 tape library.\n\nThe TS7770 models are based on high-performance and redundant IBM POWER9™ technology.

Sower"],"pages":"158","publication_date":"September 2011","description":": Information is power in supply chain operations, negotiations, continuous improvement programs, and process improvement, and indeed in all aspects of managing an operation. Accurate and timely information can result in better decisions that translate into improvement of bottom line results. The development and effective use of cost modeling as a method to understand the cost of products, services, and processes can help drive improvements in the quality and timeliness of decision making. In the supply chain community an understanding of the actual cost structures of products and services, whether with new or non-partner suppliers, can facilitate fact-based discussions which are more likely to result in agreements that are competitively priced and with fair margins. Further, accurate cost models which are cooperatively developed between supply chain partners can form the basis for joint efforts to reduce non-value-added costs and provide additional focus towards operational improvement. While many organizations feel confident they have an understanding of the cost structure for products and services produced internally, cost modeling often uncovers areas where significant cost improvement can be obtained. Cost of quality is a particular type of internal cost model that analyzes the true costs associated with the production of less than perfect products and services. The development of a cost of quality model can provide insight into how products or services of higher quality can be produced at lower cost. This book provides the business student or professional a concise guide to the creation and effective use of both internal and external cost models. Development of internal cost models is discussed with illustrations showing how they can be deployed to assist in new product development, pricing decisions, make-or-buy decisions and the identification of opportunities for internal process improvement projects. The creation and use of external cost models are discussed providing insight into how their use can drive collaborative improvement efforts among supply chain partners, better prepare for price negotiations, and keep negotiations focused on facts rather than emotions--all while allowing for future discussions with preferred suppliers to focus on more strategic and operational improvement initiatives, and less on pricing. A number of detailed cost model examples are provided to educate on both how cost models are constructed, and to demonstrate how they have been effectively deployed","tags":["Data","Data Engineering","Data Models"]},{"id":"9780071494458","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Oracle Database 11g PL/SQL Programming","authors":["Michael McLaughlin"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"April 2008","description":"Design Feature-Rich PL/SQL Applications\n\nDeliver dynamic, client/server PL/SQL applications with expert guidance from an Oracle programming professional.

All of them have improved their speed by a minimum of 10X; some of them by 100X, for example, data networks. However, spinning disk performance has only increased by 1.2 times.\n\nIBM® FlashSystem™ 840 version 1.3 closes this gap. The FlashSystem 840 is optimized for the data center to enable organizations of all sizes to strategically harness the value of stored data. It provides flexible capacity and extreme performance for the most demanding applications, including virtualized or bare-metal online transaction processing (OLTP) and online analytical processing (OLAP) databases, virtual desktop infrastructures (VDI), technical computing applications, and cloud environments. The system accelerates response times with IBM MicroLatency® access times as low as 90 µs write latency and 135 µs read latency to enable faster decision making.\n\nThe introduction of a low capacity 1 TB flash module allows the FlashSystem 840 to be configured in capacity points as low as 2 TB in protected RAID 5 mode. Coupled with 10 GB iSCSI, the FlashSystem is positioned to bring extreme performance to small and medium-sized businesses (SMB) and growth markets.\n\nImplementing the IBM FlashSystem® 840 provides value that goes beyond those benefits that are seen on disk-based arrays. These benefits include better user experience, server and application consolidation, development cycle reduction, application scalability, data center footprint savings, and improved price performance economics.\n\nThis IBM Redbooks® publication discusses IBM FlashSystem 840 version 1.3.

Bell","David Fogarty"],"pages":"5","publication_date":"January 2014","description":"The surge of interest in big data has led to growing demand for analytics teams. Assembling such teams, however, is difficult. For one thing, many companies lack the in-house knowledge and experience needed to put together a world-class analytics team. What’s more, the labor market for analytics professionals has grown increasingly tight. The shortage of analysts — particularly those capable of developing and leading world-class teams that can enable a company to create a competitive advantage from its data and analytics — is driving organizations to consider outsourcing their analytics activities. Analytics is the latest in a string of activities companies are outsourcing to business process organizations (BPOs). It draws heavily on mathematics and statistics knowledge, and many analytics-oriented BPOs have operations in India. Although some companies have world-class analytics capabilities in-house, the authors posed the question: Can an analytically naïve company “buy” world-class analytics functions by hiring outside experts? The authors studied both four multinational companies that used one or more offshore analytics BPOs and four analytics BPOs. Two of the client companies had skills that were judged to be “analytically superior”; the other two were judged to be “analytically challenged.” The analytically challenged companies saw analytics BPOs as a way to obtain the resources and training needed to manage and execute their analytics and to gain quick access to important insights. By contrast, the analytically superior companies wanted to expand their internal analytic capabilities, in part because they wanted to preserve their ability to develop and protect intellectual property; they tended to use offshore BPOs to perform low-level analytics. According to the authors, the best analytics BPOs have core competencies that go beyond what most companies can perform on their own with internal teams. They advise companies working with analytics BPOs to be clear about who does what, who owns what, how each party can use the information it has and what happens to the information and knowledge in the event that the BPO is acquired.","tags":["Data","Data Science","Web Analytics","Google Analytics"]},{"id":"9780738456997","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"IBM Spectrum Scale Immutability Introduction, Configuration Guidance, and Use Cases","authors":["Nils Haustein"],"pages":"30","publication_date":"August 2019","description":"This IBM Redpaper™ publication introduces the IBM Spectrum Scale immutability function.

Similarly, psychologists/neuroscientists don't understand the design decisions that their science is informing and how they might be leveraged further. This book explores how neuroscience and cognitive psychology inform experience design, within the modern context of research and technological advances. \n\n \n\nWith a conversational and playful tone, this book begins by grounding you in research and AI. That foundation then allows you to expand your repertoire through chapters on design-relevant cognitive phenomena such as memory, learning, and perception. By delving into how our brains handle these processes and how our designs can effectively (or ineffectively) leverage them, the book follows a journey that weaves academic learning with practical, real-world applications and examples.\n\n \n\nWith the widespread availability of generative AI tools, understanding the intersection of human cognition and design and how that knowledge can be used to build a bridge between the brain and the software has become even more critical. By understanding the brain and human behavior more completely, designers will be able to effectively use AI as an accelerator for tactical projects and provide the context that is unique to the human ability to understand the \"why.”","tags":["Data","AI & ML","Artificial Intelligence (AI)"]},{"id":"9798868805158","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Large Language Models Projects: Apply and Implement Strategies for Large Language Models","authors":["Pere Martra"],"pages":"366","publication_date":"September 2024","description":"This book offers you a hands-on experience using models from OpenAI and the Hugging Face library.

However, one of the most noticeable and credible features of this publication is, it takes the reader from the very basics and background of data hiding techniques, and run’s on the reading-road to arrive at some of the more complex methodologies employed for concealing data object from the human eye and/or the investigation. As a practitioner in the Digital Age, I can see this book siting on the shelves of Cyber Security Professionals, and those working in the world of Digital Forensics – it is a recommended read, and is in my opinion a very valuable asset to those who are interested in the landscape of unknown unknowns. This is a book which may well help to discover more about that which is not in immediate view of the onlooker, and open up the mind to expand its imagination beyond its accepted limitations of known knowns.\" - John Walker, CSIRT/SOC/Cyber Threat Intelligence Specialist\nFeatured in Digital Forensics Magazine, February 2017\n\nIn the digital world, the need to protect online communications increase as the technology behind it evolves. There are many techniques currently available to encrypt and secure our communication channels. Data hiding techniques can take data confidentiality to a new level as we can hide our secret messages in ordinary, honest-looking data files.\n\nSteganography is the science of hiding data. It has several categorizations, and each type has its own techniques in hiding. Steganography has played a vital role in secret communication during wars since the dawn of history. In recent days, few computer users successfully manage to exploit their Windows® machine to conceal their private data.\n\nBusinesses also have deep concerns about misusing data hiding techniques. Many employers are amazed at how easily their valuable information can get out of their company walls. In many legal cases a disgruntled employee would successfully steal company private data despite all security measures implemented using simple digital hiding techniques.\n\nHuman right activists who live in countries controlled by oppressive regimes need ways to smuggle their online communications without attracting surveillance monitoring systems, continuously scan in/out internet traffic for interesting keywords and other artifacts. The same applies to journalists and whistleblowers all over the world.\n\nComputer forensic investigators, law enforcements officers, intelligence services and IT security professionals need a guide to tell them where criminals can conceal their data in Windows® OS & multimedia files and how they can discover concealed data quickly and retrieve it in a forensic way.\n\nData Hiding Techniques in Windows OS is a response to all these concerns. Data hiding topics are usually approached in most books using an academic method, with long math equations about how each hiding technique algorithm works behind the scene, and are usually targeted at people who work in the academic arenas. This book teaches professionals and end users alike how they can hide their data and discover the hidden ones using a variety of ways under the most commonly used operating system on earth, Windows®.","tags":["Data","Data Engineering","Data Security & Privacy"]},{"id":"9781803237015","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Applied Machine Learning and High-Performance Computing on AWS","authors":["Mani Khanuja","Farooq Sabir","Shreyas Subramanian"],"pages":"382","publication_date":"December 2022","description":"Dive into the fascinating world of applied machine learning with high-performance computing on AWS.

It has become commonplace to blame the inadequacy of credit risk models, claiming that the crisis was due to sophisticated and obscure products being traded, but practitioners have for a long time been aware of the dangers and limitations of credit models. It would seem that a lack of understanding of these models is the root cause of their failures but until now little analysis had been published on the subject and, when published, it had gained very limited attention.\n\nCredit Models and the Crisis is a succinct but technical analysis of the key aspects of the credit derivatives modeling problems, tracing the development (and flaws) of new quantitative methods for credit derivatives and CDOs up to and through the credit crisis. Responding to the immediate need for clarity in the market and academic research environments, this book follows the development of credit derivatives and CDOs at a technical level, analyzing the impact, strengths and weaknesses of methods ranging from the introduction of the Gaussian Copula model and the related implied correlations to the introduction of arbitrage-free dynamic loss models capable of calibrating all the tranches for all the maturities at the same time. It also illustrates the implied copula, a method that can consistently account for CDOs with different attachment and detachment points but not for different maturities, and explains why the Gaussian Copula model is still used in its base correlation formulation.\n\nThe book reports both alarming pre-crisis research and market examples, as well as commentary through history, using data up to the end of 2009, making it an important addition to modern derivatives literature. With banks and regulators struggling to fully analyze at a technical level, many of the flaws in modern financial models, it will be indispensable for quantitative practitioners and academics who want to develop stable and functional models in the future.","tags":["Data","Data Engineering","Data Models"]},{"id":"9781119602873","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Machine Learning for iOS Developers","authors":["Abhishek Mishra"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"March 2020","description":"Harness the power of Apple iOS machine learning (ML) capabilities and learn the concepts and techniques necessary to be a successful Apple iOS machine learning practitioner!\n\nMachine earning (ML) is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed.

Unfortunately, traditional test design techniques are often ineffective and unreliable for revealing the various kinds of faults that may occur. This book introduces three new software testing techniques: Two-Phase Model-Based Testing, the Action-State Testing, and the General Predicate Testing, all of which work best when applied with efficient fault revealing capabilities.\n\nYou’ll start with a short recap of software testing, focusing on why risk analysis is obligatory, how to classify bugs practically, and how fault-based testing can be used for improving test design. You’ll then see how action-state testing merges the benefits of state transition testing and use case testing into a unified approach. Moving on you’ll look at general predicate testing and how it serves as an extension of boundary value analysis, encompassing morecomplex predicates. \n\nTwo-phase model-based testing represents an advanced approach where the model does not necessarily need to be machine-readable; human readability suffices. The first phase involves a high-level model from which abstract tests are generated. Upon manual execution of these tests, the test code is generated. Rather than calculating output values, they are merely checked for conformity. The last part of this book contains a chapter on how developers and testers can help each other and work as a collaborative team. \n\nWhat You'll Learn\n\nApply efficient test design techniques for detecting domain faults\nWork with modeling techniques that combine all the advantages of state transition testing and uses case testing\nGrasp the two-phase model-based testing technique\nUse test design efficiently to find almost all the bugs in an application\n\nWho This Book Is For\n\nSoftware developers, QA engineers, and, business analysts","tags":["Data","Data Science","Data Science Tasks","A/B Testing"]},{"id":"9780128001141","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"An Introduction to Probability and Statistical Inference, 2nd Edition","authors":["George G.

The scope of the project involved helping a major worldwide customer in the automotive industry to validate and justify an SOA implementation. In particular, the customer wanted to add new business values to work with its partners, by adding new data models. It also wanted to modernize an infrastructure, by adding new Internet interfaces. The customer faced the need to eradicate an obsolete programming language. Furthermore, it wanted to build a smooth migration path, with as few risks and costs as possible.\n\nThe thought, planning, and architecture of the new system, which included integration of the SOA concepts, was built by the customer with the participation of Atos Origin, a leading international IT services provider. The existing customer IT infrastructure was already built around UNIX systems, IBM System z, non-IBM clusters, SAP solutions, 3270 screens, IMS-DL/I databases, and specific code. SOA was the right solution to connect this existing environment to new components using Java, Web services, and DB2 in particular.\n\nThis book explores the business needs and the architectural choices that were faced by the customer.

The theory provides the conceptual underpinnings for a new approach which moves away from expert defined standardised metadata to a user driven approach with users as metadata co-creators. Moving away from definitive, authoritative, metadata to a system that reflects the diversity of users’ terminologies, it changes the current focus on metadata simplicity and efficiency to one of metadata enriching, which is a continuous and evolving process of data linking. From predefined description to information conceptualised, contextualised and filtered at the point of delivery. By presenting this shift, this book provides a coherent structure in which future technological developments can be considered.\n\nMetadata is valuable when continuously enriched by experts and users\nMetadata enriching results from ubiquitous linking\nMetadata is a resource that should be linked openly\nThe power of metadata is unlocked when enriched metadata is filtered for users individually","tags":["Data","Information Science","Digital Library"]},{"id":"9781590594223","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"PeopleSoft for the Oracle DBA","authors":["David Kurtz"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"November 2004","description":"The newest addition to the OakTable Press series, PeopleSoft for the Oracle DBA, will teach you a range of techniques for maintaining a PeopleSoft system.

It is no longer unheard of to have 20-terabyte databases running on a SQL Server. SQL Server administration used to just be the job of a database administrator (DBA), but as SQL Server proliferates throughout smaller companies, many developers have begun to act as administrators as well. Additionally, some of the new features in SQL Server are more developer-centric, and poor configuration of these features can result in poor performance. SQL Server now enables you to manage the policies on hundreds of SQL Servers in your environment as if you were managing a single instance. We've provided a comprehensive, tutorial-based book to get you over the learning curve of how to configure and administer SQL Server 2008.\n\nWhether you're an administrator or developer using SQL Server, you can't avoid wearing a DBA hat at some point. Developers often have SQL Server on their own workstations and must provide guidance to the administrator about how they'd like the production configured. Oftentimes, they're responsible for creating the database tables and indexes. Administrators or DBAs support the production servers and often inherit the database from the developer.\n\nThis book is intended for developers, DBAs, and casual users who hope to administer or may already be administering a SQL Server 2008 system and its business intelligence features, such as Integration Services. This book is a professional book, meaning the authors assume that you know the basics about how to query a SQL Server and have some rudimentary concepts of SQL Server already. For example, this book does not show you how to create a database or walk you through the installation of SQL Server using the wizard. Instead, the author of the installation chapter may provide insight into how to use some of the more advanced concepts of the installation. Although this book does not cover how to query a SQL Server database, it does cover how to tune the queries you've already written.\n\nThe first ten chapters of the book are about administering the various areas of SQL Server, including the developer and business intelligence features. Chapter 1 briefly covers the architecture of SQL Server and the changing role of the DBA. Chapters 2 and 3 dive into best practices on installing and upgrading to SQL Server 2008. Managing your SQL Server database instance is talked about in Chapter 4. This chapter also describes some of the hidden tools you may not even know you have.\n\nOnce you know how to manage your SQL Server, you can learn in Chapter 5 how to automate many of the redundant monitoring and maintenance tasks. This chapter also discusses best practices on configuring SQL Server Agent. Chapters 6 and 7 cover how to properly administer and automate many tasks inside of the Microsoft business intelligence products, such as Integration Services and Analysis Services. Developers will find that Chapter 8 is very useful, as it covers how to administer the development features, such as SQL CLR. Chapter 9 explains how to secure your SQL Server from many common threats and how to create logins and users. Chapter 10 covers how to create a SQL Server project and do proper change management in promoting your scripts through the various environments. It also covers the Policy-Based Management framework in SQL Server.\n\nChapters 11 through 15 make up the performance tuning part of the book. Chapter 11 discusses how to choose the right hardware configuration for your SQL Server in order to achieve optimal performance. After the hardware and operating system is configured, Chapter 12 shows you how to optimize your SQL Server instance for the best performance. Chapter 13 describes how to monitor your SQL Server instance for problematic issues such as blocking and locking. Chapters 14 and 15 discuss how to optimize the T-SQL that accesses your tables and then how to index your tables appropriately.\n\nChapters 16 through 20 consist of the high-availability chapters of the book. Chapter 16 covers how to use the various forms of replication, while database mirroring is covered in Chapter 17. Classic issues and best practices with backing up and recovering your database are discussed in Chapter 18. Chapter 19 dives deeply into the role of log shipping in your high-availability strategy, and Chapter 20 presents a step-by-step guide to clustering your SQL Server and Windows 2008 server.\n\nThis edition of the book covers all the same great information we covered in the last book, and we've added loads of new content for SQL Server 2008, which adds numerous new features to improve the DBA's life. In short, the new version of SQL Server focuses on improving your efficiency, the scale of your server, and the performance of your environment, so you can do more in much less time, and with fewer resources and people. This means you can manage many servers at one time using Policy-Based Management, scale your I/O load using compression, and collect valuable information about your environment using data collectors, to name just a few key new features.\n\nTo follow the examples in this book, you will need to have SQL Server 2008 installed. If you wish to learn how to administer the business intelligence features, you need to have Analysis Services and the Integration Services components installed. You need a machine that can support the minimum hardware requirements to run SQL Server 2008; and you also need the AdventureWorks2008 and AdventureWorksDW2008 databases installed. Instructions for accessing these databases can be found in the ReadMe file on this book's Web site.\n\nSome features in this book (especially in the high-availability part) require the Enterprise or Developer Edition of SQL Server. If you do not have this edition, you will still be able to follow through some of the examples in the chapter with Standard Edition.","tags":["Data","Data Engineering","Relational Databases","Microsoft SQL Server"]},{"id":"0738490822","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"DB2 Integrated Cluster Environment Deployment Guide","authors":["Whei-Jen Chen","Rav Ahuja","Yong Jun Bi"],"pages":"412","publication_date":"October 2004","description":"The IBM DB2 Integrated Cluster Environment for Linux is a completely integrated, high-performance, and pre-tested solution that incorporates best-of-breed software, hardware, and services.

This is also a major weakness when it tempts developers to start coding too soon. Small applications that consist of tens of pages can be coded without a lot of design work because they can be re-factored quickly when design flaws are discovered. Design flaws in large cloud and enterprise applications that consist of hundreds or thousands of pages are not so easy to re-factor due to the time needed to redevelop and retest the application, not to mention the risk of breaking functionality in subtle ways.\nDesigning a large application before coding starts is a profitable exercise because a thoughtful design goes a long way in mitigating cost overruns and schedule slippage while simultaneously enhancing quality. This book takes into account perspectives from other non-developer stakeholders such as maintenance developers, business analysts, testers, technical writers, end users, and business owners. Overlooking these perspectives is one of the chief causes of expensive rework late in the development cycle. \nOracle Application Express by Design illustrates APEX design principles by using architecture diagrams, screen shots, and explicit code snippets to guide developers through the many design choices and complex interrelationship issues that must be evaluated before embarking on large APEX projects.

It has a very rich toolset that allows for storage (Hadoop), configuration (YARN and ZooKeeper), collection (Nutch and Solr), processing (Storm, Pig, and Map Reduce), scheduling (Oozie), moving (Sqoop and Avro), monitoring (Chukwa, Ambari, and Hue), testing (Big Top), and analysis (Hive).\n\nThe problem is that the Internet offers IT pros wading into big data many versions of the truth and some outright falsehoods born of ignorance. What is needed is a book just like this one: a wide-ranging but easily understood set of instructions to explain where to get Hadoop tools, what they can do, how to install them, how to configure them, how to integrate them, and how to use them successfully. And you need an expert who has worked in this area for a decade—someone just like author and big data expert Mike Frampton.\n\nBig Data Made Easy approaches the problem of managing massive data sets from a systems perspective, and it explains the roles for each project (like architect and tester, for example) and shows how the Hadoop toolset can be used at each system stage. It explains, in an easily understood manner and through numerous examples, how to use each tool.

In this report from Strata + Hadoop World co-chair Alistair Croll, you'll learn how the ubiquity of cheap sensors, fast networks, and distributed computing have given rise to several developments that will soon have a profound effect on individuals and society as a whole. Machine learning, for example, has quickly moved from lab tool to hosted, pay-as-you-go services in the cloud. Those services, in turn, are leading to predictive apps that will provide individuals with the right functionality and content at the right time by continuously learning about them and predicting what they'll need. Computational power can produce cognitive augmentation.Report topics include:\n\nThe swing between centralized and distributed computing\nMachine learning as a service\nPersonal digital assistants and cognitive augmentation\nGraph databases and analytics\nRegulating complex algorithms\nThe pace of real-time data and automation\nSolving dire problems with big data\nImplications of having sensors everywhere\nThis report contains many more examples of how big data is starting to reshape business and change behavior, and it's just a small sample of the in-depth information Strata + Hadoop World provides.

You then receive a welcoming text telling you when lunch will be served, or perhaps a health warning based on allergy information you’ve stored in your profile. Maybe you’ll be flagged as a security threat. How is that possible? This O’Reilly report explores ambient computing—hands-free, 24/7 wireless connectivity to hardware, data, and IT systems.\n\nEnabling that scenario requires a lot of work behind the scenes to determine network connectivity, device security, and personal privacy. With an ambient-computing technology stack already in the works, resolving those issues is only a matter of time.
