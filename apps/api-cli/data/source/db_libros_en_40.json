The computational counterpart of the CS-model is called IMMSIM which stands for IMMune system SIMulator. IMMSIM was written in 1992 by the physicist Phil E. Seiden and the immunologist Franco Celada. This model was built around the idea of developing a computerized system to perform experiments similar in vivo experiments; a tool developed to help biologists testing theories and hypothesis about how the immune system works.\n\nC-ImmSim is best viewed as a collection of models in a single program. It incorporates the principal core facts of today’s immunological knowledge, such as the diversity of specific elements, MHC restriction, clonal selection, thymic education of T cells, antigen processing and presentation (both the cytosolic and endocytic pathways are implemented), cell-cell cooperation, homeostasis of cells created by the bone marrow, hyper mutation of antibodies, maturation of the cellular and humoral response, and memory. Besides, an antigen can represent a bacterium, a virus, or an allergen or a tumor cell. C-ImmSim has been recently customized to simulate the HIV-1 infection. Moreover,　it can simulate the immunotherapy for cancer. These features are all present in the code and people can choose to turn them on and off at compiling time.\n\nThe book presents the basic model as well as the various customizations to implement the description of different diseases and the way they have been used in practice to produce new knowledge either from hypothesis or from lab-experiment data. In this respect, the book can be used as a practical guide to implement a computational model with which to study a specific disease and to try to address realistic clinical questions.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Science","Medical Science"]},{"id":"9780133039191","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Search Engine Marketing, Inc.: Driving Search Traffic to Your Company’s Website, Third Edition","authors":["Mike Moran","Bill Hunt"],"pages":"528","publication_date":"December 2014","description":"The #1 Step-by-Step Guide to Search Marketing Success...Now Updated and Reorganized to Help You Drive Even More Value\n\nFor years, Search Engine Marketing, Inc. has been the definitive practical guide to driving value from search.

However, relatively little emphasis has been placed on attention, its functions, and phenomenology. As a result, there are a multitude of definitions and explanatory frameworks that describe what attention is, what it does, and how it works. This volume proposes that one way to discuss attention is by utilizing an integrative multidisciplinary framework that takes into consideration aspects of attention as a means of accessing the world and as a mediator of experience. It brings together contributions from cognitive science, philosophy, and psychology in order to shed light on these aspects of attention. By including both theoretical and empirical approaches to attention, this volume will provide (1) an innovative framework for examining attention as something that mediates experience and (2) new perspectives on foundational and defi nitional issues of what attention is and how it contributes to our ability to access the world. By drawing together different disciplines, this volume broadens the concept of attention.

We call New Geometry both Observers in arithmetics and in geometry. We reconsider the basis of classic geometry (points, straight lines, planes and space) from this Mathematics point of view. The relations of connection, order, parallels (Euclid, Gauss-Bolyai-Lobachevsky, Riemann), congruence, continuity are discovered and have new properties. We show that almost all classic geometry theorems are satisfied in Mathematics with Observers geometry with probabilities less than 1.\n\nThat means classic geometries are not a limiting cases of the Observer’s geometry, but are only particular cases. And new geometry opens the road to reconsider differential geometry, algebraic geometry, geometric algebra, topology, and also to reconsider geometrical applications to various parts of contemporary physics.\n\nWe proved that Mathematics with Observers gives a birth a new geometry.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Math"]},{"id":"9781000702699","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Sustainable Building Conservation","authors":["Oriel Prizeman"],"pages":"176","publication_date":"July 2019","description":"This book incorporates UK and international case studies and essays to identify the overlaps in the interests of energy and building conservation.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Engineering"]},{"id":"9781118102787","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Launch: How to Quickly Propel Your Business Beyond the Competition","authors":["Michael A.

Glaciers have shrunk, ice on rivers and lakes is breaking up early, and plant and animal ranges have relocated. On a worldwide scale, the threat posed by climate change and pollution is obvious.

These behaviours include celibacy along with various forms of asceticism, and rituals that harm the performer. Such behaviours are found in widely different cultures. How is this possible? This book shows that these behaviours (as is religion in general) are by-products of features of the human mind whose evolutionary fitness is beyond doubt and explores those features.\n\nWhich are those features? This book proposes a twofold answer. It draws attention to the layered nature of human consciousness, in which different manners of experience are superimposed on each other. This goes a long way toward accounting for the universal religious belief in some kind of transcendental world, a \"higher\" reality, different from \"ordinary\" reality. The layering of consciousness comes about in childhood and gains in prominence with the acquisition of a first language, which is the second feature highlighted in this book. Together, these features explain a variety of \"normal\" religious behaviours and beliefs, and account for the possibility of mystical experience. They also explain the occurrence of behaviours that do not augment evolutionary fitness.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Science","Psychology"]},{"id":"9780136628026","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"MOS Study Guide for Microsoft Word Exam MO-100","authors":["Joan Lambert"],"pages":"208","publication_date":"May 2020","description":"Advance your proficiency with Word.

The book posits integrated reporting as a key mechanism by which companies can ensure their own long-term sustainability by contributing to a sustainable society. Although integrated reporting has seen substantial development due to the support of companies, investors, and the initiatives of a number of NGOs, widespread regulatory intervention has yet to materialize. Outside of South Africa, adoption remains voluntary, accomplished via social movement abetted, to varying degrees, by market forces. In considering integrated reporting's current state of play, the authors provide guidance to ensure wider adoption of the practice and success of the movement, starting with how companies can improve their own reporting processes. But the support of investors, regulators, and NGOs is also important. All will benefit, as will society as a whole.\n\nReaders will learn how integrated reporting has evolved over the years, where frameworks and standards are today, and the practices that help ensure effective implementation—including, but not limited to an extensive discussion of information technology's role in reporting and the importance of corporate reporting websites. The authors introduce the concepts of an annual board of directors' \"Statement of Significant Audiences and Materiality\" and a \"Sustainable Value Matrix\" tool that translates the statement into management decisions.

This method distinguishes itself from statistical approaches, which in general do not account for novel usages, and from efforts directed at metaphor constrained to one type of phrase or to a single topic domain.\n\nThe more interesting and novel metaphors appear to be based on concepts generally represented as nouns, since such concepts can be understood from a variety of perspectives. The core of the process of interpreting nominal concepts is to represent them in such a way that readers or hearers can infer which aspect(s) of the nominal concept is likely to be intended to be applied to its interpretation. These aspects are defined in terms of verbal and adjectival predicates. A section on the representation and processing of part-sentence verbal metaphor will therefore also serve as preparation for the representation of salient aspects of metaphorically used nouns.\n\nAs the ability to process metaphorically used verbs and nouns facilitates the interpretation of more complex tropes, computational analysis of two other kinds of metaphorically based expressions are outlined: metaphoric compound nouns, such as \"idea factory\" and, together with the representation of inferences, modified metaphoric idioms, such as \"Put the cat back into the bag\".","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Math"]},{"id":"9780133353136","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Excel® 2013 On Demand","authors":["Perspection Inc.

In this interdisciplinary text, scholars examine the ways in which local languages and cultural traditions, modes of production and communication, patterns of local knowledge and authority affect how people and cultures resist or accommodate demands for such change. With work from acclaimed contributors, this pioneering volume is the first analysis of the influence of Jack Goody. It provides a thorough look at the relations between societies of different practices, customs, and values, determining the mechanisms behind sociocultural stability and change. Technology, Literacy, and the Evolution of Society is intended for graduate students and academics in history, anthropology, psychology, sociology, and education, as well as academics and all others interested in pursuing the directions and implications of the work and influence of Jack Goody.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Science"]},{"id":"9780749466640","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Psychometrics in Coaching, 2nd Edition","authors":["Jonathan Passmore"],"pages":"440","publication_date":"November 2012","description":"Psychometrics in Coaching offers expert advice on how coaches, consultants and human resource managers can use psychometrics to support and develop individuals.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Science","Psychology","Psychometric Tests"]},{"id":"9781891853463","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Technological Change and the Environment","authors":["Arnulf Grübler"],"pages":"408","publication_date":"September 2010","description":"Much is written in the popular literature about the current pace of technological change. But do we have enough scientific knowledge about the sources and management of innovation to properly inform policymaking in technology dependent domains such as energy and the environment? While it is agreed that technological change does not 'fall from heaven like autumn leaves,' the theory, data, and models are deficient. The specific mechanisms that govern the rate and direction of inventive activity, the drivers and scope for incremental improvements that occur during technology diffusion, and the spillover effects that cross-fertilize technological innovations remain poorly understood.\n\nIn a work that will interest serious readers of history, policy, and economics, the editors and their distinguished contributors offer a unique, single volume overview of the theoretical and empirical work on technological change. Beginning with a survey of existing research, they provide analysis and case studies in contexts such as medicine, agriculture, and power generation, paying particular attention to what technological change means for efficiency, productivity, and reduced environmental impacts. The book includes a historical analysis of technological change, an examination of the overall direction of technological change, and general theories about the sources of change. The contributors empirically test hypotheses of induced innovation and theories of institutional innovation. They propose ways to model induced technological change and evaluate its impact, and they consider issues such as uncertainty in technology returns, technology crossover effects, and clustering.

In the end, social media is still media — that is, mediums of communication — and those new mediums can be used as badly and counterproductively as any traditional mode.\n\nTo show how companies can create a winning strategy, the authors contrast the experiences of two companies — an unnamed technology company and Tupperware Nordic, the Scandinavian branch of the kitchenware company. The technology company focused on software to facilitate social networking, not on using those new tools to build communities. It also tended to communicate in ways employees found insincere. Between insincere messages from the executive team and easier communication with other disgruntled employees, the initiative had no real positive effects for the company. Tupperware, by contrast, used the technology to help the company convey community spirit to its sales associates and took advantage of social media’s unique ability to foster better vertical and horizontal communication.\n\nThe authors conclude that although social media can help create closer and more dynamic stakeholder relationships, success with an online community requires a leader who can build emotional capital and who values community building as a means of creating economic value.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Marketing","Digital Marketing","Social Media Marketing"]},{"id":"9780789736697","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Business Solutions Microsoft® Office Access 2007 Forms, Reports, and Queries","authors":["Paul McFedries"],"pages":"408","publication_date":"May 2007","description":"“Everything you need to master Access 2007 forms, reports, and queries.”\n\n–Charles Carr, Reviews Editor, ComputorEdge Magazine\n\nCreate Forms for Business\n\nEnsure Data Entry Accuracy\n\nBuild Elegant Form Interfaces\n\nCollect Data Via Email\n\nDesign Effective Business Reports\n\nMake an Invoice Report\n\nCreate Mailing Labels\n\nExtract Data\n\nWork with Multiple Tables\n\nCalculate Discounts\n\nAnalyze Data\n\nDevelop your Microsoft Access expertise instantly with proven techniques\n\nLet’s face it: Microsoft Access is a large, intimidating program.

Not once in its century-long history had GM reversed a decision to close a plant. But Mayor David Hollister quietly went to work building the Lansing Works! Keep GM! movement and succeeded in defying all the odds. Lansing remains GM’s Oldsmobile headquarters.\n\nHollister’s collaborative problem-solving approach—the Second Shift model—succeeded in bringing together state and regional politicians, economic developers, private sector firms, labor unions, educators, and residents of the region. Powerful, persuasive, and well-organized, this coalition implemented a strategic, six-dimensional framework to achieve the seemingly impossible:\n\n• Identifying: Name the challenge and its impact • Partnering: Develop meaningful relationships • Building: Construct your strategy as you go • Solving: Engage in constant problem solving • Celebrating: Mark successful milestones • Persevering: Adapt and endure\n\nThe Lansing Works! Keep GM! movement was a victory of people over bureaucracy, of a can-do attitude over cynicism—a story rarely told in today’s complex, technological, and often dehumanizing world of large business and out-of-control government. And the best part was that, in the end, both sides came away winners. It’s proof positive that when the public and private sectors work together as equal partners, amazing things can happen.\n\nOne of the great business sagas of modern times, Second Shift provides a proven, practical design for problem solving that anyone can apply in any business, large or small.","tags":["Software Development","Programming Languages",".NET","Microsoft Build Engine"]},{"id":"9781119844570","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Office For Seniors For Dummies","authors":["Faithe Wempen"],"pages":"400","publication_date":"January 2022","description":"Send emails, stay on top of your finances, and manage your everyday life with this no-experience-necessary Office 2021 handbook\n\nMicrosoft Office offers huge benefits to people of all ages.

Suitable for researchers in computer graphics, computer vision, visualization, medical imaging, and geometric modeling as well as graduate and senior undergraduate students in computer science, Diffusion-Driven Wavelet Design for Shape Analysis presents recent research results in wavelet designs on 3D shapes and their applications in shape analysis. It explains how to apply the design methods to various types of 3D data, such as polygonal meshes, point clouds, manifolds, and volumetric images.\n\nExtensions of Wavelet Generation on Volumetric and Manifold DataThe first part of the book introduces design methods of wavelets on manifold data, incorporating interdisciplinary knowledge from differential geometry, functional analysis, Fourier transform, spectral graph theory, and stochastic processes. The authors show how wavelets are purely determined by the shape geometry and how wavelet transforms are computed as inner products of wavelet kernels and input functions.\n\nWavelets for Solving Computer Graphics ProblemsThe second part presents applications in shape analysis/representation. The book looks at wavelets as spectral tools for geometry processing with filters in a joint space-frequency domain and examines wavelets as detail extractors for shape feature definition and detection. Going beyond these fundamental applications, the book also covers middle- and high-level applications, including shape matching, shape registration, and shape retrieval.\n\nEasy-to-Understand Implementations and AlgorithmsUnlike many other wavelet books, this one does not involve complicated mathematics.

One of the major performance limitations in today's chip designs is clock skew, the uncertainty in arrival times between a pair of clocks. Increasing clock frequencies are forcing many engineers to rethink their timing budgets and to use skew-tolerant circuit techniques for both domino and static circuits. While senior designers have long developed their own techniques for reducing the sequencing overhead of domino circuits, this knowledge has routinely been protected as trade secret and has rarely been shared. Skew-Tolerant Circuit Design presents a systematic way of achieving the same goal and puts it in the hands of all designers.This book clearly presents skew-tolerant techniques and shows how they address the challenges of clocking, latching, and clock skew. It provides the practicing circuit designer with a clearly detailed tutorial and an insightful summary of the most recent literature on these critical clock skew issues.\n\nSynthesizes the most recent advances in skew-tolerant design in one cohesive tutorial\nProvides incisive instruction and advice punctuated by humorous illustrations\nIncludes exercises to test understanding of key concepts and solutions to selected exercises","tags":["Hardware","Embedded Systems","Microelectronics"]},{"id":"9781801071727","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Migrating Linux to Microsoft Azure","authors":["Rithin Skaria","Toni Willberg"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"July 2021","description":"Migrating Linux to Microsoft Azure is your comprehensive guide to successfully moving Linux-based workloads to the Azure cloud platform.

His primary insight is that our sensorium does not, beyond immediate social groups, present smooth, mirror-like vistas of our socially networked world. Contrariwise, he shows that this uniquely human array of channels presents a mosaic of disparate inputs with subtle fissures and sutures between and among them. That more sophisticated view of our sensory apparatus allows him to describe with great practicality, the fissured, segmented architectures we inject into our enterprises and, above all, our markets. These insights particularly illuminate the revolution reshaping our understanding of the basic couplet of value exchange driving markets: Buying and selling. In this revolution a more telling focus on services as catalysts of value exchange is supplanting the traditional terms: goods and product, as the architecture of that very human sensorium broached above modulates value exchange across the chain of institutional need in markets.

This book will assist you inboth respects by (1) offering concise discussions of the primarylegal frameworks governing the social, economic, andenvironmental dimensions of supply chain management,operations management, and marketing; and (2) making the business case for going beyond mere compliance with legalrequirements.Written by an expert in environmental law and publicpolicy, this book argues that companies that go beyondmere compliance with social, economic, and environmentalsafeguards inherent in legal regimes will capture greaterbenefits and incur fewer risks from their supply chain, operations,and marketing activities.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Marketing"]},{"id":"9780134275796","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"My Social Media for Seniors","authors":["Michael Miller"],"pages":"336","publication_date":"November 2015","description":"Learn Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Skype, and More!\n\nMy Social Media for Seniors helps you learn what social media is all about, and how to use it to connect with friends, families, and more.

When the deaths from these categories are counted they become the leading cause of fatality to Americans, outpacing cancer and heart disease. Add the numbers of fatalities (mortality) to the millions each year who are injured (morbidity) and whose quality of life is forever effected, and an epidemic of harm is defined.\n\nThe book describes the many systemic and social causes of medical error and iatrogenic events, all of which are cited in the peer-review science, that have a direct effect on the epidemic of patient injury, but are rarely or never considered. These systemic causes include factory medicine (for-profit medicine), staffing ratios in clinical and non-clinical departments, shift work, healthcare working conditions, lack of accountability, legal issues that conflict with patient safety issues, bullying and hierarchical relationships, training of healthcare workers that never rises to the level of risk, and injury to healthcare workers. The premise of the book is that if the systemic or social causes are not considered or changed, then medical error will continue to be an epidemic and no substantial impact in the numbers will be realized.\n\nAn expert with 30 years of experience as a health and safety officer in healthcare and as an activist for community health and safety issues, editor and author William Charney explores the issues surrounding medical errors and examines the science behind possible solutions. He presents an efficient dialogue that produces a more systemic exploration and targeting of the causes of medical error and drives an exacting message: we are dealing with an epidemic of harm, and unless systemic issues are solved, little will change to subdue the epidemic.\n\nInformation on the June 2012 Conference on the Epidemic of Medical Errors & Hospital Acquired Infections in the US and Canada: the Systemic Causes can be found on the CRC Press Issuu page.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Science","Medical Science"]},{"id":"9781483295961","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Reasoning About Plans","authors":["James Allen","Henry Kautz","Richard Pelavin"],"pages":"300","publication_date":"June 2014","description":"This book presents four contributions to planning research within an integrated framework.

Crelling"],"pages":"408","publication_date":"October 2008","description":"This book is an integrated approach towards the applications of coal (organic) petrology and discusses the role of this science in the field of coal and coal-related topics. Coal petrology needs to be seen as a continuum of organic (macerals) and inorganic (minerals and trace elements) contributions to the total coal structure, with the overprint of coal rank. All this influences the behavior of coal in utilization, the coal by-products, the properties of coal as a reservoir for methane or a sequestration site for carbon dioxide, and the relationships of coal utilization with health and environmental issues. The interaction of coal properties and coal utilization begins at the mine face. The breakage of the coal in mining influences its subsequent beneficiation. Beneficiation is fundamental to the proper combustion of coal and is vital to the preparation of the feedstock for the production of metallurgical coke. An understanding of basic coal properties is important for achieving reductions in trace element emissions and improving the efficiency of combustion and combined-cycle gasification. The production of methane from coal beds is related to the properties of the in situ coal. Similarly, coal bed sequestration of carbon dioxide produced from combustion is dependent on the reservoir properties. Environmental problems accompany coal on its way from the mine to the point of utilization and beyond. Health aspects related with coal mining and coal utilization are also included because, in planning for coal use, it is impossible to separate environmental and health issues from the discussion of coal utilization. The book is aimed at a wide audience, ranging from researchers, lecturers and students to professionals in industry and discusses issues (such as the environmental, and health) that are of concern to the general public as a whole.Key Features: - This book focuses on the applications of coal (organic) petrology to our modern society. - It is an integrated approach to help the reader appreciate the importance of coal quality and coal utilization. Coal composition (macerals, mineral, trace elements) and the overprint of coal rank are treated together. - The book synthesises all the possibilities of the organic petrology as a tool for coal utilization in conventional applications (mining and beneficiation, coal combustion, gasification, liquefaction, carbonization), as a precursor of carbon materials and as a petroleum source and reservoir rock. - The role of applied petrology in the characterization of solid by-products from coal utilization is also discussed. - In addition, this book describes the present status of environmental and health problems linked to coal utilization and the ways in which such problems might be overcome in the future.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Engineering","Oil & Gas"]},{"id":"9781118417676","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Pinterest Marketing: An Hour a Day","authors":["Jennifer Evans Cario"],"pages":"336","publication_date":"January 2013","description":"Develop and implement a Pinterest marketing strategy with this step-by-step guide\n\nPinterest is the fastest-growing social media platform, with more than 80 percent of its users women between the ages of 25 and 54.

Different disruptions have different degrees of impact, which affects how companies prioritize risk management efforts, and different disruptions occur with different frequencies or likelihoods. Author Yossi Sheffi notes that many risk management experts categorize potential disruptions by two dimensions: likelihood of occurrence and magnitude of impact. However, he writes, there is an important third dimension: the detection lead time. This is the amount of warning time during which a company can prepare for the disruption and mitigate its effects.\n\nAs the author explains, some disruptions involve long-term trends that are widely discussed in the media (for example, aging populations in the Western world, China, and Japan) or are prescheduled events (such as new regulations or labor union contract deadlines; some (for instance, hurricanes) occur after a short warning of a few days; while others such as fires, earthquakes, or power outages occur without warning. Still other disruptions (such as product contaminations or design defects) may not be discovered until well after they’ve occurred or may never be recognized (for example, industrial espionage or cyberattacks).\n\nDrawing on examples from companies including Dow Chemical, Ikea, BNSF Railway, Walgreen’s, Cisco Systems, UPS, and FedEx, the article presents nine data sources that leading companies use to improve their ability to detect potential disruptions early: monitoring the weather; tracking the news; using data from sensors; monitoring the supply base; visiting suppliers; being on the alert for deception; developing traceability capabilities; monitoring social media; and tracking regulatory developments. The article then discusses four ways companies can improve their abilities to both detect and respond to disruptions: (1) mapping the supply chain to determine the locations of their suppliers to assess supplier risks, (2) assessing global events to identify potential disruptions that could affect production or revenues, (3) creating supply chain control towers with technology, people, and processes that capture and use supply chain data to enable better short- and long-term decision making, and (4) improving response time through data and analysis.\n\n“Detection means vigilance on both specific near-term events and potential future events that might disrupt the company,” the author writes. “It depends on creating visibility into the supply chain and understanding how the global moving parts connect to each other and impact each other.” He adds: “At its heart, detection is the conversion of the relevant unknowns into salient knowns in a timely fashion.”","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Engineering","Civil Engineering"]},{"id":"9780768695120","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Easy Microsoft® Excel® 2010","authors":["Michael Alexander"],"pages":"216","publication_date":"June 2010","description":"This year, millions of beginner-to-intermediate-level users will be searching for the easiest possible way to master Excel 2010's new features - and, with Easy Microsoft Excel 2010, you'll find exactly what you're looking for.

Requiring very little mathematical background on the reader’s part, this concise book introduces the models by focusing on their physical meaning and the supporting data; it then goes on to provide a wide scope of possible applications.\n\nThe book also introduces a new concept of the Gini-type index, which when applied to aging/rejuvenating components (nonrepairable systems) can measure how different a given aging/rejuvenation distribution is compared to the exponential distribution. A similar index is then applied to aging/rejuvenating repairable systems, creating a bridge between the concepts. The chapters discuss models used in reliability, risk analysis, physics of failure, fracture mechanics, biological, pharmaceutical, and medical studies. They comprise an up-to-date, concise, and informative resource on reliability models, which does not require any special mathematical background.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Engineering","Mechanical Engineering"]},{"id":"9781430219149","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Pro Business Activity Monitoring in BizTalk 2009","authors":["Jeff Sanders","Geoff Snowman"],"pages":"386","publication_date":"July 2009","description":"Business Activity Monitoring, or BAM, provides real-time business intelligence by capturing data as it flows through a business system.

Its modeling is based on the frequency distributed fractional integrator, while the resulting model corresponds to an integer order and infinite dimension state space representation. This original modeling allows the theoretical concepts of integer order systems to be generalized to fractional systems, with a particular emphasis on a convolution formulation. With this approach, fundamental issues such as system state interpretation and system initialization – long considered to be major theoretical pitfalls – have been solved easily. Although originally introduced for numerical simulation and identification of FDEs, this approach also provides original solutions to many problems such as the initial conditions of fractional derivatives, the uniqueness of FDS transients, formulation of analytical transients, fractional differentiation of functions, state observation and control, definition of fractional energy, and Lyapunov stability analysis of linear and nonlinear fractional order systems. This second volume focuses on the initialization, observation and control of the distributed state, followed by stability analysis of fractional differential systems.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Math"]},{"id":"9780134115993","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Models and Applications in the Decision Sciences: Best Papers from the 2015 Annual Conference","authors":["Decision Sciences Institute","Merrill Warkentin"],"pages":"352","publication_date":"December 2015","description":"NEW ADVANCES IN THE SCIENCE OF DECISION MAKING:\n\nPractical and relevant research from DSI, the field’s leading organization\n\n14 OUTSTANDING PAPERS APPLYING RIGOROUS RESEARCH METHODS TO IMPORTANT SOCIETAL AND BUSINESS DECISION ENVIRONMENTS\n\nNEW OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE PERFORMANCE IN STRATEGY, TACTICS, AND OPERATIONS\n\nFOR ALL DECISION MAKERS, AND ALL DECISION SCIENCE RESEARCHERS AND STUDENTS\n\nMore than 1,000 papers were submitted to the Decision Science Institute’s 2015 annual conference.

The thickness of the material remains almost constant, and that allows for forming of thick sheets/plates, which was not possible before. The field has reached a point where designers have opportunities to expand the extent of unitized structures, which are structures in which the traditional primary part and any supporting structures are fabricated as a single unit. With advanced optimization and material considerations, this class of structures can be lighter weight and more efficient, making them less costly, as well as mechanically less complex, reducing areas of possible failure.\n\nDiscusses how friction stir processing allows selective microstructural refinement without thickness change\nDemonstrates how higher thickness sheets and plates can be superplastically formed\nExamples are presented for aluminum, magnesium and titanium alloys\nCovers the production of low-cost unitized structures by selectively processing cast sheets/plates","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Engineering","Civil Engineering"]},{"id":"9780415817745","language":"en","level":null,"title":"Advertising at the Crossroads (RLE Advertising)","authors":["Max A.

Buyers today look very differently from those of the past. They make networked purchasing decisions by committee, with diverse roles, interests and backgrounds. With access to more information and a greater ability to share it, they demand value, access and alignment from their counterparties.\n\nSales is now a team sport, and to win you have to build and manage selling squads that work in complete alignment—not just during client meetings, but before and after, as well. In Sell Like a Team, Michael Dalis, a senior consultant at the legendary sales training firm, The Richardson Company, guides you through the process of creating and managing selling squads that execute and win in every sales meeting or pitch.\n\nWinning selling squads are fueled by trust.

Each microservice can be independently built, deployed, and scaled. This pattern provides enterprise grade durability and scale to meet complex business goals and customer needs in enterprise systems. While the return is valuable and the concept straightforward, applying it to an enterprise development effort is far more complicated. Where do you start? How do you find the seams between the components? And once you have all the services, how do you deploy and scale them to meet the durability and performance needs of the organization?\n\nPro Microservices in .NET 10 will introduce you to all that and more. The authors get you started with an overview of microservices and other development patterns, event storming, domain-driven design, and the options for developing in ASP.NET. You will use that foundational information to build a reference application throughout the book, exploring both synchronous messaging with HTTP, gRPC, and asynchronous messaging with a service bus. From there, you will create your first microservice using C# and .NET 10, test it using unit and integration tests, and package it into a Docker container. You’ll deploy the container to various Azure services including Kubernetes, Azure Container Apps, App Service, Azure Functions, and KEDA. You will also learn about communication styles, decentralizing data, and testing microservices. Finally, you will learn how to keep services healthy using OpenTelemetry for logging, Aspire for local development, and Azure Application Insights for production.\n\nWhat You Will Learn\n\nBuild a foundation of basic microservices architecture design\nFollow an example of using event storming and domain-driven design to understand the monolithic application modified for microservices\nLearn about ASP.NET hosting options including MVC, Razor Pages, Web API, and Minimal APIs\nCall microservices using RPC and messaging communication styles via HTTP and gRPC\nLearn about asynchronous communication using an enterprise service bus\nComprehend decentralizing data and handling distributed transactions\nUnderstand via detailed commands how Docker is used to containerize applications\nLearn to deploy microservices to Kubernetes, Azure Container Apps, App Services, and Azure Functions\nLeverage OpenTelemetry to make your microservices more robust\n\nWho This Book Is For\n\nThis book is for professional developers and software architects looking to level up their skills.

However, most discussions of Bayesian inference rely on intensely complex mathematical analyses and artificial examples, making it inaccessible to anyone without a strong mathematical background. Now, though, Cameron Davidson-Pilon introduces Bayesian inference from a computational perspective, bridging theory to practice–freeing you to get results using computing power.\n\nBayesian Methods for Hackers illuminates Bayesian inference through probabilistic programming with the powerful PyMC language and the closely related Python tools NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib. Using this approach, you can reach effective solutions in small increments, without extensive mathematical intervention.\n\nDavidson-Pilon begins by introducing the concepts underlying Bayesian inference, comparing it with other techniques and guiding you through building and training your first Bayesian model. Next, he introduces PyMC through a series of detailed examples and intuitive explanations that have been refined after extensive user feedback. You’ll learn how to use the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm, choose appropriate sample sizes and priors, work with loss functions, and apply Bayesian inference in domains ranging from finance to marketing. Once you’ve mastered these techniques, you’ll constantly turn to this guide for the working PyMC code you need to jumpstart future projects.\n\nCoverage includes\n\n• Learning the Bayesian “state of mind” and its practical implications\n\n• Understanding how computers perform Bayesian inference\n\n• Using the PyMC Python library to program Bayesian analyses\n\n• Building and debugging models with PyMC\n\n• Testing your model’s “goodness of fit”\n\n• Opening the “black box” of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm to see how and why it works\n\n• Leveraging the power of the “Law of Large Numbers”\n\n• Mastering key concepts, such as clustering, convergence, autocorrelation, and thinning\n\n• Using loss functions to measure an estimate’s weaknesses based on your goals and desired outcomes\n\n• Selecting appropriate priors and understanding how their influence changes with dataset size\n\n• Overcoming the “exploration versus exploitation” dilemma: deciding when “pretty good” is good enough\n\n• Using Bayesian inference to improve A/B testing\n\n• Solving data science problems when only small amounts of data are available\n\nCameron Davidson-Pilon has worked in many areas of applied mathematics, from the evolutionary dynamics of genes and diseases to stochastic modeling of financial prices. His contributions to the open source community include lifelines, an implementation of survival analysis in Python.

They hire engineering and construction contractors to do it for them. Unfortunately, selecting contractors and negotiating the terms of a major project is one of the most difficult aspects of project management...and organizations waste billions of dollars and \"bake in\" months or years of delay by doing it wrong. Contracting is also the area of project management that is most prone to firmly held opinions unencumbered by any facts. We intend to remedy that situation with this book. Drawing on a properietary detailed database of over 1100 major projects, the world's leading industrial engineering project consultant, Ed Merrow explains:\n\nKey Principles of Contracting for Major Projects:\n\nOwners are from Mars; contractors are from Venus\nAll the biggest risks in contracting belong to the owner\nContracting “games” will normally be won by contractors, not owners\nMost risk transfer from owners to contractors is an illusion\nContractors do good projects well and bad projects poorly\nContractors may have shareholders, but they are not your shareholders!\nMixing different contract types with different contractors on the same project is unwise\nEconomize on the need for trust; trust only when being trustworthy has value\n\nMerrow also explains:\n\nWhich contract incentives work and which don’t and WHY\nWhich of over a dozen contracting strategies work best and which ones hardly ever work and WHY\n\nThe strategic advice in this book is designed for owners and contractor project managers, team members and supply chain, executives, and other business leaders involved in major projects. It's also an indispensable resource for engineers, leaders of industrial firms, bankers, and academics studying the messy realities of the construction and engineering industries.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Engineering","Civil Engineering","Construction Project Management"]},{"id":"9789352861804","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Engineering Mathematics","authors":["P.

These formulae are translated from algebra into plain English to aid understanding as the vast majority of practitioners involved in the financial markets are not required to compute or calculate prices or sensitivities themselves as they have access to data providers. Thus, the intention of this book is for the practitioner to gain a deeper understanding of these calculations, both for a safety reason – it is better to understand what is behind the data we manipulate – and secondly being able to appreciate the magnitude of the prices we are confronted with and being able to draft a rough calculation, aside of the market data.\n\nThe author has avoided excessive formalism where possible.

Differential equations and new mathematical methods are developed in the text as the occasion demands.The book begins by describing fundamental concepts, such as velocity and acceleration, upon which subsequent chapters build. The second edition has been updated with two new sections added to the chapter on Hamiltonian formulations, and the chapter on collisions and scattering has been rewritten. The book also contains three new chapters covering Newtonian gravity, the Hamilton-Jacobi theory of dynamics, and an introduction to Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations for continuous systems and classical fields. To help students develop more familiarity with Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations, these essential methods are introduced relatively early in the text. The topics discussed emphasize a modern perspective, with special note given to concepts that were instrumental in the development of modern physics, for example, the relationship between symmetries and the laws of conservation. Applications to other branches of physics are also included wherever possible. The author provides detailed mathematical manipulations, while limiting the inclusion of the more lengthy and tedious ones.

Process for System Architecture and Requirements Engineering introduces a new approach that is particularly useful for multidisciplinary system development: It applies equally well to all technologies and thereby provides a common language for developers in widely differing disciplines. The Hatley-Pirbhai-Hruschka approach (H/H/P) has another important feature: the coexistence of the requirements and architecture methods and of the corresponding models they produce. These two models are kept separate, but the approach fully records their ongoing and changing interrelationships. This feature is missing from virtually all other system and software development methods and from CASE tools that only automate the requirements model. System managers, system architects, system engineers, and managers and engineers in all of the diverse engineering technologies will benefit from this comprehensive, pragmatic text. In addition to its models of requirements and architecture and of the development process itself, the book uses in-depth case studies of a hospital monitoring system and of a multidisciplinary groundwater analysis system to illustrate the principles. Compatibility Between the H/H/P Methods and the UML: The Hatley/Pirbhai architecture and requirements methods—described in Strategies for Real-Time System Specification—have been widely used for almost two decades in system and software development. Now known as the Hatley/Hruschka/Pirbhai (H/H/P) methods, they have always been compatible with object-oriented software techniques, such as the UML, by defining architectural elements as classes, objects, messages, inheritance relationships, and so on. In Process for System Architecture and Requirements Engineering, that compatibility is made more specific through the addition of message diagrams, inheritance diagrams, and new notations that go with them. In addition, state charts, while never excluded, are now specifically included as a representation of sequential machines. These additions make definition of the system/software boundary even more straightforward, while retaining the clear separation of requirements and design at the system levels that is a hallmark of the H/H/P methods—not shared by most OO techniques. Once the transition to software is made, the developer is free to continue using the H/H/P methods, or to use the UML or any other software-specific technique.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Engineering"]},{"id":"9781119235866","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Fuzzy Logic with Engineering Applications, 4th Edition","authors":["Timothy J.

In system modeling, mathematical expression deals with modeling and its applications. It is characterized that how a modeling competency can be categorized and its activity can contribute to building up these competencies. Mathematical modeling of a practical system is an attractive field of research and an advanced subject with a variety of applications. The main objective of mathematical modeling is to predict the behavior of the system under different operating conditions and to design and implement efficient control strategies to achieve the desired performance.\n\nA considerable effort has been directed to the development of models, which must be understandable and easy to analyze. It is a very difficult task to develop mathematical modeling of complicated practical systems considering all its possible high-level non-linearity and cross couple dynamics. Although mathematical modeling of nonlinear systems sounds quite interesting, it is difficult to formulate the general solution to analyze and synthesize nonlinear dynamical systems. Most of the natural processes are nonlinear, having very high computational complexity of several numerical issues. It is impossible to create any general solution or individual procedure to develop exact modeling of a non-linear system, which is often improper and too complex for engineering practices. Therefore, some series of approximation procedures are used, in order to get some necessary knowledge about the nonlinear system dynamics. There are several complicated mathematical approaches for solving these types of problems, such as functional analysis, differential geometry or the theory of nonlinear differential equations.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Math"]},{"id":"9781449336530","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Illustrated Guide to Home Biology Experiments","authors":["Robert Robert Bruce Thompson Thompson","Barbara Barbara Fritchman Thompson Thompson"],"pages":"378","publication_date":"April 2012","description":"Experience the magic of biology in your own home lab.

Bendle","Charan K. Bagga"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"April 2016","description":"A big challenge for marketing is demonstrating its business value. As the finance function becomes more powerful within companies, some see marketing’s influence as declining. One major reason is the difficulty of measuring its impact. The article has two purposes, the authors say: First, to clarify marketing metrics so that managers select the right metrics and use them appropriately; and second, to help senior managers understand when marketers are cherry-picking the data or using inappropriate metrics.\n\nThe authors assess five popular marketing metrics: market share, net promoter score, the value of a “like,” customer lifetime value, and return on investment. They conducted interviews with marketers and administered formal surveys to managers. They found that popular marketing metrics are regularly misunderstood and misused. The authors’ goal is to encourage appropriate and consistent use of popular marketing metrics.\n\nMarket Share: If the aim is to maximize the returns to shareholders, the authors argue, increased market share offers no benefit unless it eventually generates profits. Still, in a survey the authors conducted, they found that more marketing managers prioritized maximizing market share than prioritized maximizing profitability. Although, they note, companies with superior products tend to have high market share and high profitability, this does not necessarily mean that increasing market share will increase profits. Using market share as a metric of success simply because other marketers do it can be counterproductive.\n\nNet Promoter Score: Companies in a variety of industries have embraced net promoter score as a way to monitor their customer service operations. One of NPS’s strongest selling points, the authors write, is its simplicity: It’s easy for managers and employees to understand the goal of having more promoters and fewer detractors. However, they note weaknesses in how the theory has been presented to managers.Value of a “Like” The authors caution that managers shouldn’t automatically assume that differences in value between social media fans and nonfans are caused by social media marketing activity. When there are differences, managers need to investigate whether they existed prior to the social media marketing effort.\n\nCustomer Lifetime Value: Marketers often use CLV to help them decide whom to target in acquisition campaigns. The authors recommend basing CLV on the value of the customer relationship -- not the value of the customer relationship minus the acquisition costs.\n\nReturn on Investment: Although ROI may not be a perfect metric, the authors concede, it can facilitate communication with nonmarketing colleagues. But to communicate effectively, marketers must use the term in ways that nonmarketers can understand. In order to calculate ROI, there must be a return (profit associated with an investment) and an investment. Unless you have both, you cannot calculate ROI.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Marketing"]},{"id":"9781000705096","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"101 Rules of Thumb for Low Energy Architecture","authors":["Huw Heywood"],"pages":"128","publication_date":"July 2019","description":"The emphasis is on passive low-energy principles, and the rules of thumb cover all the design fundamentals from site and location to orientation and form, peppered with some which will help the designer to think ‘outside the box’ about the design process itself.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Engineering","Civil Engineering"]},{"id":"9781000703061","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Guide to JCT Intermediate Building Contract 2016","authors":["Sarah Lupton"],"pages":"160","publication_date":"August 2019","description":"Guide to JCT Intermediate Building Contract 2016 is a practical guide to the operation and administration of JCTs IC16 suite of building contracts including both IC and ICD.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Engineering"]},{"id":"9780128125649","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Multisensory Perception","authors":["K.

Individuals are continually making and revising judgments about each other's abilities as they interact. The flexible, situated view of competence conveyed by the research of the authors in this volume is a departure from the way that competence is usually thought about in the fields of communication disabilities and education. In the social constructivist view, competence is not a fixed mass, residing within an individual, or a fixed judgment, defined externally. Rather, it is variable, sensitive to what is going on in the here and now, and coconstructed by those present. Constructions of competence are tied to evaluations implicit in the communication of the participants as well as to explicit evaluations of how things are going. The authors address the social construction of competence in a variety of situations: engaging in therapy for communication and other disorders, working and living with people with disabilities, speaking a second language, living with deafness, and giving and receiving instruction. Their studies focus on adults and children, including those with disabilities (aphasia, traumatic brain injury, augmentative systems users), as they go about managing their lives and identities. They examine the all-important context in which participants make competence judgments, assess the impact of implicit judgments and formal diagnoses, and look at the types of evaluations made during interaction. This book makes an argument all helping professionals need to hear: institutional, clinical, and social practices promoting judgments must be changed to practices that are more positive and empowering.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Science","Psychology"]},{"id":"9781483141343","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Electric Wiring, 3rd Edition","authors":["A.

This book addresses the “what comes next? question by presenting the recently proposed waveform known as Orthogonal Time-Frequency-Space (OTFS), which offers a better alternative for high-mobility environments.\n\nThe OTFS waveform is based on the idea that the mobile wireless channels can be effectively modelled in the delay-Doppler domain. This domain provides a sparse representation closely resembling the physical geometry of the wireless channel. The key physical parameters such as relative velocity and distance of the reflectors with respect to the receiver can be considered roughly invariant in the duration of a frame up to a few milliseconds. This enables the information symbols encoded in the delay-Doppler domain to experience a flat fading channel even when they are affected by multiple Doppler shifts present in high-mobility environments.\n\nDelay-Doppler Communications: Principles and Applications covers the fundamental concepts and the underlying principles of delay-Doppler communications. Readers familiar with OFDM will be able to quickly understand the key differences in delay-Doppler domain waveforms that can overcome some of the challenges of high-mobility communications. For the broader readership with a basic knowledge of wireless communications principles, the book provides sufficient background to be self-contained.

This text covers a wide range of issues of central concern to contemporary measurement theorists, and a broad range of philosophical perspectives are represented. The formalist, representationalist approach defines measurement as the assignment of numbers to entities and events to represent their properties and relations. It also states that measurement theory is supposed to analyze the concept of a scale of measurement, describe various types of scales and their uses, and formulate the conditions required for the existence of scales of various types. Since this approach dominates contemporary measurement theory, the volume begins with essays by some of its leading architects. In order to allow for diverse points of view, the book also includes articles that attempt to broaden this approach, and several that even criticize the approach.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Science","Psychology"]},{"id":"9781119387619","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Applied Probabilistic Calculus for Financial Engineering","authors":["Bertram K.

This particular symposium was conceived in reference to the 1974 symposium entitled Cognition and Instruction. In the 25 years since that symposium, reciprocal relationships have been forged between psychology and education, research and practice, and laboratory and classroom learning contexts. Synergistic advances in theories, empirical findings, and instructional practice have been facilitated by the establishment of new interdisciplinary journals, teacher education courses, funding initiatives, and research institutes. So, with all of this activity, where is the field of cognition and instruction? How much progress has been made in 25 years? What remains to be done? This volume proposes and illustrates some exciting and challenging answers to these questions. Chapters in this volume describe advances and challenges in four areas, including development and instruction, teachers and instructional strategies, tools for learning from instruction, and social contexts of instruction and learning. Detailed analyses of tasks, subjects' knowledge and processes, and the changes in performance over time have led to new understanding of learners' representations, their use of multiple strategies, and the important role of metacognitive processes. New methods for assessing and tracking the development and elaboration of knowledge structures and processing strategies have yielded new conceptualizations of the process of change. Detailed cognitive analysis of expert teachers, as well as a direct focus on enhancing teachers' cognitive models of learners and use of effective instructional strategies, are other areas that have seen tremendous growth and refinement in the past 25 years. Similarly, the strong impact of curriculum materials and activities based on a thorough cognitive analysis of the task has been extended to the use of technological tools for learning, such as intelligent tutors and complex computer based instructional interfaces. Both the shift to conducting a significant portion of the cognition and instruction research in real classrooms and the increased collaboration between academics and educators have brought the role of the social context to center stage.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Science","Psychology"]},{"id":"9780814433324","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"The Art of Social Selling","authors":["Shannon Belew"],"pages":"272","publication_date":"January 2014","description":"Social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Pinterest are changing the way consumers make purchasing decisions . . . and tapping into these online communities has become a necessary part of any integrated sales strategy.

The book begins with an introduction to the need for control by describing how an aircraft flies complete with figures illustrating roll, pitch, and yaw control using its ailerons, elevators, and rudder, respectively. The book moves on to rigid body dynamics about a single axis (gears, cart rolling down an incline) and then to modeling DC motors, DC tachometers, and optical encoders. Using the transfer function representation of these dynamic models, PID controllers are introduced as an effective way to track step inputs and reject constant disturbances.\n\nIt is further shown how any transfer function model can be stabilized using output pole placement and on how two-degree of freedom controllers can be used to eliminate overshoot in step responses. Bode and Nyquist theory are then presented with an emphasis on how they give a quantitative insight into a control system's robustness and sensitivity.

Design of these processes is made more complex because of the time dependent nature of the process and the allowable flexibility. More often than not, every unit encounters optimal control problems. Therefore, traditional design books have not covered batch processing in detail. Filling this void, Batch Processing: Modeling and Design describes various unit operations in batch and bio-processing as well as design methods for these units.\n\nTopics include:\n\nBatch distillation operating modes and configurations\nBatch absorption operations based on the solubility difference\nBatch adsorption based on differential affinity of various soluble molecules to solid absorbents\nBatch chromatography for measuring a wide variety of thermodynamic, kinetic, and physico-chemical properties\nBatch crystallization where a phase is used to find the supersaturation at which point material crystallizes\nBatch drying that stresses the phase diagram of water to describe this operation\nBatch filtration using a porous medium or screen to separate solids from liquids\nBatch centrifugation where centrifugal force is used for separation\n\nBatch processes are widely used in pharmaceutical, food, and specialty chemicals where high value, low volume products are manufactured. Recent developments in bio-based manufacturing also favor batch processes because feed variations can be easily handled in batch processes. Further, the emerging area of nanomaterials manufacturing currently uses batch processes as they are low volume, high energy intensive processes. With examples, case studies, and more than 100 homework problems, this book describes the unit operations in batch and bioprocessing and gives students a thorough grounding in the numerical methods necessary to solve these design problems.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Science","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering"]},{"id":"9780128242322","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Technologies for Solar Thermal Energy","authors":["Md Hasanuzzaman"],"pages":"384","publication_date":"March 2022","description":"Technologies for Solar Thermal Energy: Theory, Design and Optimization presents concepts surrounding industrial process heat and thermal power generation, including detailed theory and practical considerations for design, performance analysis, and economic assessments.

However, a handbook that provides established M&S practices has not been available. Until now. Modeling and Simulation-Based Systems Engineering Handbook details the M&S practices for supporting systems engineering in diverse domains. It discusses how you can identify systems engineering needs and adapt these practices to suit specific application domains, thus avoiding redefining practices from scratch.\n\nAlthough M&S practices are used and embedded within individual disciplines, they are often developed in isolation. However, they address recurring problems common to all disciplines. The editors of this book tackled the challenge by recruiting key representatives from several communities, harmonizing the different perspectives derived from individual backgrounds, and lining them up with the book’s vision. The result is a collection of M&S systems engineering examples that offer an initial means for cross-domain capitalization of the knowledge, methodologies, and technologies developed in several communities. These examples provide the pros and cons of the methods and techniques available, lessons learned, and pitfalls to avoid.\n\nAs our society moves further in the information era, knowledge and M&S capabilities become key enablers for the engineering of complex systems and systems of systems. Therefore, knowledge and M&S methodologies and technologies become valuable output in an engineering activity, and their cross-domain capitalization is key to further advance the future practices in systems engineering.

Although consistent in purpose, these models differ in terminology and design--enough sometimes to cause conflict and confusion when used within the same organization. Addressing the need for a more coordinated approach, Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI®) provides a single framework for improvement in software engineering, systems engineering, integrated product and process development, and supplier sourcing.\n\nThis book is the definitive reference for the most current release of CMMI models. To use a CMMI model available on the SEI Web site, users must choose from among multiple models based on their organization's improvement needs. This book provides a single source for all CMMI model information. Readers can get started without having to select a model first--all of the choices are compiled in one place and explained in detail.\n\nThe book begins with background information needed to understand the content and structure of these integrated models and how to use them. A case study illustrates their implementation in a real environment. A variety of practical material, such as glossary and index, is also provided. The bulk of the book comprises the content of all CMMI models, covering the 25 process areas (PAs) that span the product life cycle, including detailed best practices.\n\nAll CMMI models have two representations. The continuous representation allows an organization to improve using selected PAs at different rates. The staged representation enables organizations to follow a predefined and proven improvement path using multiple PAs. Both representations are described so that readers will more clearly see the similarities and differences between the two representations and will be able to choose the right approach for their organization.\n\nWhether you are new to CMMI or are already familiar with some version of it, this book is an essential resource for managers, practitioners, and process improvement team members who need to understand, evaluate, and/or implement a CMMI model. The ultimate objective of CMMI is integrating processes to improve products; this book contains everything you need to get that done.\n\n0321154967B01232003","tags":["Business","Project & Product Management","Product Management","Measuring IT / Software","Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI)"]},{"id":"9781000180138","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Discrete Signals and Systems with MATLAB®, 3rd Edition","authors":["Taan S.

However, no single book has ever focused on how the integration of these two areas is creating a stronger platform for various scientific advancements—including some research work that cannot be performed on Earth.\n\nTo fill the void, Information, Communication, and Space Technology provides a novel illustration of that connection. Dividing content into sections that cover ICT, existing and future space technologies, and satellites, the author demonstrates the individual and combined power of each of these parts of the overall system. He explores how the combination of concepts from each of these interrelated fields is creating massive potential for broader advances in areas such as robotics, communications, navigation, agriculture, health care, and nanotechnology. The book introduces particular potential innovations, including \"rocket-less\" spacecraft launches, and development of a global system to balance energy distribution by using satellites that would collect solar energy and transmit it via microwave beams to different locations around the world.\n\nEqually useful to students and professionals, this work is a culmination of the domestic and international experience that the author has acquired throughout more than three decades as an instructor and researcher. Emphasizing the strong need to incorporate ICT and space technology into the general university curriculum, the book starts with basic explanations of key concepts and theories, building toward more concrete, application-oriented examples that reveal the importance and impact of new technologies. This includes coverage of how satellites transfer voice, video, and other data across continents, as well as techniques used to obtain very-high-resolution images from space for use in agricultural and environmental sciences.This timely work employs a logical, practically structured approach that will help readers to better understand existing and emerging ICT and space technologies, including the most recent developments and achievements in the field.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Engineering","Satellites"]},{"id":"9781483105291","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Understand Electrical and Electronics Maths","authors":["Owen Bishop"],"pages":"328","publication_date":"October 2013","description":"Understand Electrical and Electronics Maths covers elementary maths and the aspects of electronics.

Building on the work of Schank and Abelson, the author uses goals as the basis for a model of interpersonal relations which permits decisions to incorporate personal and adopted goals in a uniform manner. The theory is modelled on the VOTE computer program which simulates Congressional roll-call voting decisions. The VOTE program expands traditional decision making and simulation models by providing not only a choice, but also a natural language explanation, in either English or French. It simulates real members of Congress voting on real bills, and producing reasonable explanations. The program is consistent with much of the descriptive political science literature on Congressional decision making and provides an explicit model of political issues, relationships, and strategies that converge in voting behavior. In developing the VOTE program, the author draws on his own practical experience in politics from four presidential campaigns and the White House. Given the underlying psychological basis of the program, VOTE can be extended to other decision making domains different from politics. Another use for the program is to simulate business decisions such as securities analysis, as well as mundane decision making such as choosing a college or deciding whether to get a Mohawk haircut.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Science","Psychology"]},{"id":"9780132609975","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Making Better Sense: How Your Mental Models Define Your World","authors":["Colin Crook","Yoram Wind"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"September 2010","description":"This Element is an excerpt from The Power of Impossible Thinking: Transform the Business of Your Life and the Life of Your Business (9780131425026) by Yoram (Jerry) Wind and Colin Crook with Robert Gunther.

In many cases, the examples demonstrate how the new functions can work with long-available functions, such as MID, IF, COUNTIF, etc., which now also boast dynamic array functionality.\n\n \n\nWhat You Will Learn\n\nUnlock the dynamic array potential in Microsoft Excel\nApply dynamic array functions and confidently direct them to real-world spreadsheet tasks\nKnow the distinctive ways in which arrays work and can be applied to numerous data-analytic tasks\n\nWho This Book Is For\n\nUsers of Excel 365 and beyond who are comfortable with, but not necessarily expert in, formula writing, as well as those who are unaware of or not fluent with dynamic arrays. It is also valuable to data journalists and other professionals in need of spreadsheet skills who may unaware of dynamic arrays, and the time they could save by applying them to their work.","tags":["Data","Spreadsheets","Microsoft Excel"]},{"id":"9781118719800","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"BIM Design","authors":["Richard Garber"],"pages":"248","publication_date":"August 2014","description":"Building information modelling (BIM) is revolutionising building design and construction. For architects, BIM has the potential to optimise their creativity while reducing risk in the design and construction process, thus giving them a more significant role in the building process. This book demonstrates how innovative firms are using BIM technologies to move design away from the utilitarian problems of construction, engaging them in a stunning new future in the built environment.\n\nWhereas recent books about BIM have tended to favour case-study analyses or instruction on the use of specific software, BIM Design highlights how day-to-day design operations are shaped by the increasingly generative and collaborative aspects of these new tools. BIM strategies are described as operations that can enhance design rather than simply make it more efficient. Thus this book focuses on the specific creative uses of information modelling at the operational level, including the creative development of parametric geometries and generative design, the evaluation of environmental performance and the simulation and scheduling of construction/fabrication operations.\n\nThis book also engages BIM’s pragmatic efficiencies such as the conflict checking of building systems and the creation of bills of quantities for costing; and in so doing it demonstrates how BIM can make such activities collaborative.\n\nThroughout, projects are used to illustrate the creative application of BIM at a variety of scales. These buildings showcase work by fi rms executing projects all over the world: SHoP Architects and Construction (New York), Morphosis (Los Angeles), Populous (London), GRO Architects (New York), Reiser + Umemoto (New York), Gensler (Shanghai) and UNStudio (Amsterdam).","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Engineering","Civil Engineering"]},{"id":"9781119074175","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Theory and Practice of Aircraft Performance","authors":["Ajoy Kumar Kundu","Mark A.

Understanding antibiotic resistance, therefore, is becoming increasingly essential for a broad audience of healthcare professionals, biomedical and public health researchers, students, and policymakers. The authors answer questions such as: What is resistance? How does it emerge? How do common human activities contribute to resistance? What can we do about it? How can we strengthen our “first lines of defense” against resistance? Are there better ways to discover new antibiotics? What unique issues are associated with MRSA and viral influenza? In addition to defining and evaluating one of the most important emerging threats to public health, the authors explain what can be done to minimize risks to public health, and to preserve and extend the effectiveness of existing and new antibiotics.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Science","Medical Science"]},{"id":"9781119423423","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Advanced Numerical and Semi-Analytical Methods for Differential Equations","authors":["Snehashish Chakraverty","Nisha Mahato","Perumandla Karunakar"],"pages":"256","publication_date":"April 2019","description":"Examines numerical and semi-analytical methods for differential equations that can be used for solving practical ODEs and PDEs\n\nThis student-friendly book deals with various approaches for solving differential equations numerically or semi-analytically depending on the type of equations and offers simple example problems to help readers along.\n\nFeaturing both traditional and recent methods, Advanced Numerical and Semi Analytical Methods for Differential Equations begins with a review of basic numerical methods.

Often a single study will not provide the answers and it is desirable to synthesise evidence from multiple sources, usually randomised controlled trials. This book takes an approach to evidence synthesis that is specifically intended for decision making when there are two or more treatment alternatives being evaluated, and assumes that the purpose of every synthesis is to answer the question “for this pre-identified population of patients, which treatment is ‘best’?”\n\nA comprehensive, coherent framework for network meta-analysis (mixed treatment comparisons) is adopted and estimated using Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods implemented in the freely available software WinBUGS. Each chapter contains worked examples, exercises, solutions and code that may be adapted by readers to apply to their own analyses.\n\nThis book can be used as an introduction to evidence synthesis and network meta-analysis, its key properties and policy implications. Examples and advanced methods are also presented for the more experienced reader.\n\n \n\nMethods used throughout this book can be applied consistently: model critique and checking for evidence consistency are emphasised.\nMethods are based on technical support documents produced for NICE Decision Support Unit, which support the NICE Methods of Technology Appraisal.\nCode presented is also the basis for the code used by the ISPOR Task Force on Indirect Comparisons.\nIncludes extensive carefully worked examples, with thorough explanations of how to set out data for use in WinBUGS and how to interpret the output.\n\nNetwork Meta-Analysis for Decision Making will be of interest to decision makers, medical statisticians, health economists, and anyone involved in Health Technology Assessment including the pharmaceutical industry.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Science","Medical Science"]},{"id":"9780763792367","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Nursing Informatics and the Foundation of Knowledge, 2nd Edition","authors":["Dee McGonigle","Kathleen Mastrian"],"pages":"664","publication_date":"August 2011","description":"Completely updated, the Second Edition of Nursing Informatics and the Foundation of Knowledge covers the history of healthcare informatics, current issues, basic informatics concepts, and health information management applications.

In Decoding the New Consumer Mind, award-winning consumer psychologist Kit Yarrow shares surprising insights about the new motivations and behaviors of shoppers, taking marketers where they need to be today: into the deeply psychological and often unconscious relationships that people have with products, retailers, marketing communications, and brands.\n\nDrawing on hundreds of consumer interviews and shop-alongs, Yarrow reveals the trends that define our transformed behavior. For example, when we shop we show greater emotionality, hunting for more intense experiences and seeking relief and distraction online. A profound sense of isolation and individualism shapes the way we express ourselves and connect with brands and retailers. Neurological research even suggests that our brains are rewired, altering what we crave, how we think, and where our attention goes.\n\nDecoding the New Consumer Mind provides marketers with practical ways to tap into this new consumer psychology, and Yarrow shows how to combine technology and innovation to enhance brand image; win love and loyalty through authenticity and integrity; put the consumer's needs and preferences front and center; and deliver the most emotionally intense, yet uncomplicated, experience possible.

As most textbooks about this powerful computing paradigm date back to the 1960s and 1970s, it fills a void and forges a bridge from the early days of analog computing to future applications. The idea of analog computing is not new. In fact, this computing paradigm is nearly forgotten, although it offers a path to both high-speed and low-power computing, which are in even more demand now than they were back in the heyday of electronic analog computers. This first chapters of this book define the notion of analog computing and cover the early history of mechanical and electromechanical analog computers before focusing on the development and the basics of electronic analog computing elements and computers based on these. Two chapters give an introduction to the programming of analog computers with a number of detailed sample problems and solutions. These problems range from simple mass-spring-damper systems to predator-prey simulations and conformal mappings. The following chapters introduce the basic concepts of hybrid computers and digital differential analyzers, the latter of which offer an enourmous potential for future applications based on field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) or the like. The second half of the book is dedicated to an overview of typical applications of analog computers based on a comprehensive bibliography. The last chapter describes future prospects for the analog computing paradigm.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Math","Logic"]},{"id":"9781631572555","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Managerial Forensics","authors":["J.

However, climate change adds a new dimension to the task of developing and testing science-based management options to deal with the effects of stressors on forest ecosystems in the southern United States. The large spatial scale and complex interactions make traditional experimental approaches difficult. Yet, the current progression of climate change science offers new insights from recent syntheses, models, and experiments, providing enough information to start planning now for a future that will likely include an increase in disturbances and rapid changes in forest conditions.Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation Management Options: A Guide for Natural Resource Managers in Southern Forest Ecosystems provides a comprehensive analysis of forest management options to guide natural resource management in the face of future climate change. Topics include potential climate change impacts on wildfire, insects, diseases, and invasives, and how these in turn might affect the values of southern forests that include timber, fiber, and carbon; water quality and quantity; species and habitats; and recreation. The book also considers southern forest carbon sequestration, vulnerability to biological threats, and migration of native tree populations due to climate change.This book utilizes the most relevant science and brings together science experts and land managers from various disciplines and regions throughout the south to combine science, models, and on-the-ground experience to develop management options. Providing a link between current management actions and future management options that would anticipate a changing climate, the authors hope to ensure a broader range of options for managing southern forests and protecting their values in the future.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Science","Climate Change"]},{"id":"9781430224792","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Windows Azure Platform","authors":["Tejaswi Redkar"],"pages":"624","publication_date":"January 2010","description":"Learn to build flawless cloud services using the four components of the Azure Services Platform.

This book will guide you on how to differentiate between the two and to think more clearly and correctly when making those decisions, thereby increasing organizational success. The author has based this book on the fields of epistemology—the study of how knowledge is created—and the philosophy of science— the study of what it means for a science to be called a science. The motivation behind the book is quite simple: Given that science is so successful, why shouldn’t marketers borrow thinking and reasoning skills from science and apply them to marketing? Indeed, why not? The book details the groundwork for learning how to apply scientific reasoning to the field of marketing, such as some basic and important definitions (“What is a belief?” “What is knowledge?”), and identifies barriers to scientific reasoning, giving an example from the Dow Chemical Company and just how Dow uses critical thinking and reasoning skills to make more effective marketing and business decisions. You’ll also learn some real “thinking tools” you will need to apply scientific reasoning to solving your marketing problems. It introduces topics relating to attributes versus constructs, the meaning of causation, the relationship between coherence and justified beliefs, the importance of logic to sound reasoning, and the avoidance of logical fallacies in making sound recommendations. The book concludes by giving you direction to further improve your ability to apply scientific reasoning to solving marketing problems.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Marketing"]},{"id":"9780789743848","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Facebook® Marketing","authors":["Justin R.

The new edition makes more use of modern tools for working problems, such as COMSOL®, Maple®, and MATLAB®. It introduces new problems at the end of each chapter and sorts them by topic for ease of use. It also presents new concepts to expand the utility of the text beyond chemical engineering.The text is divided into two parts, which can be used for teaching a two-term course. Part I covers the balance equation in the context of diffusive transport—momentum, energy, mass, and charge. Each chapter adds a term to the balance equation, highlighting that term's effects on the physical behavior of the system and the underlying mathematical description. Chapters familiarize students with modeling and developing mathematical expressions based on the analysis of a control volume, the derivation of the governing differential equations, and the solution to those equations with appropriate boundary conditions.Part II builds on the diffusive transport balance equation by introducing convective transport terms, focusing on partial, rather than ordinary, differential equations. The text describes paring down the microscopic equations to simplify the models and solve problems, and it introduces macroscopic versions of the balance equations for when the microscopic approach fails or is too cumbersome. The text discusses the momentum, Bournoulli, energy, and species continuity equations, including a brief description of how these equations are applied to heat exchangers, continuous contactors, and chemical reactors. The book also introduces the three fundamental transport coefficients: the friction factor, the heat transfer coefficient, and the mass transfer coefficient in the context of boundary layer theory. The final chapter covers the basics of radiative heat transfer, including concepts such as blackbodies, graybodies, radiation shields, and enclosures.

Good design requires the integration of many different forms of knowledge, including physics, aesthetics, business acumen, engineering, and architecture. It also requires a systems approach that combines and assimilates different technologies and structures. Good design is accomplished when art meets science to achieve higher-performance and more-efficient and effective systems. Introduction to Photovoltaic System Design provides readers with the knowledge they need to design high-performance PV systems. The text takes a systematic approach to designing PV, with emphasis on custom-design approaches for every system. Readers will encounter the latest, real-world information regarding site evaluations, strings and wire sizing, designing to code, PV components, and monitoring and testing.\n\nAbout the Series:\n\nThe Photovoltaics (PV) industry stands on the brink of a revolution. The appeal of a new and growing industry has brought an influx of new PV professionals to the market, but the availability of educational resources has not kept pace with market demands. This gap has led to serious quality and performance issues that the industry will need to face in the decades ahead.\n\nThe Art and Science of Photovoltaics series was developed to fill this education gap. Each book in the series goes beyond simple systematic processes by tackling performance challenges using a systems perspective. Readers do not learn PV design and installation steps in a vacuum; instead they gain the knowledge and expertise to understand interrelationships and discover new ways to improve their own systems and positively contribute to the industry.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Engineering","Electrical Engineering"]},{"id":"0789725525","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Business Analysis with Microsoft® Excel, Second Edition","authors":["Conrad Carlberg"],"pages":"504","publication_date":"September 2001","description":"Take control of the bottom line using expert techniques and Excel's powerful financial capabilities!

There is a good chance thus that users and consumers are better informed about the objectives and persuasive tricks of the advertising industry than ever before. At the same time, advertisers can inform about products and services without the limitations of time and place faced by traditional mass media.\n\nBut will there really be a time when advertisers and consumers have equal power, or does tracking users online and offline lead to a situation where advertisers have more information about the consumers than ever before?

However, because of the introduction of computer engineering courses into already-crowded four-year undergraduate programs, the transmission line courses in many electrical engineering programs have been relegated to a senior technical elective, if offered at all.\n\nNow, Analysis of Multiconductor Transmission Lines, Second Edition has been significantly updated and reorganized to fill the need for a structured course on transmission lines in a senior undergraduate- or graduate-level electrical engineering program. In this new edition, each broad analysis topic, e.g., per-unit-length parameters, frequency-domain analysis, time-domain analysis, and incident field excitation, now has a chapter concerning two-conductor lines followed immediately by a chapter on MTLs for that topic. This enables instructors to emphasize two-conductor lines or MTLs or both.\n\nIn addition to the reorganization of the material, this Second Edition now contains important advancements in analysis methods that have developed since the previous edition, such as methods for achieving signal integrity (SI) in high-speed digital interconnects, the finite-difference, time-domain (FDTD) solution methods, and the time-domain to frequency-domain transformation (TDFD) method. Furthermore, the content of Chapters 8 and 9 on digital signal propagation and signal integrity application has been considerably expanded upon to reflect all of the vital information current and future designers of high-speed digital systems need to know.\n\nComplete with an accompanying FTP site, appendices with descriptions of numerous FORTRAN computer codes that implement all the techniques in the text, and a brief but thorough tutorial on the SPICE/PSPICE circuit analysis program, Analysis of Multiconductor Transmission Lines, Second Edition is an indispensable textbook for students and a valuable resource for industry professionals.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Engineering","Electrical Engineering","Signal Processing"]},{"id":"9781439894354","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Energy Harvesting Autonomous Sensor Systems","authors":["Yen Kheng Tan"],"pages":"254","publication_date":"December 2017","description":"This book is considered the first to describe sensor-oriented energy harvesting issues.

Crystalline semiconductors can be produced at surprisingly low temperatures (as low as 120 ˚C) by crystallization of amorphous semiconductors, which are put in contact with a metal. This so-called metal-induced crystallization process has attracted great scientific and technological interest because it allows the production of crystalline semiconductor-based advanced devices at very low temperatures, for example, directly on low-cost (but often heat-sensitive) substrates.\n\nThis book provides the first comprehensive and in-depth overview of the current fundamental understanding of the metal-induced crystallization process and further elucidates how to employ this process in different technologies, for example, in thin-film solar cells and display technologies. It aims to give the reader a comprehensive perspective of the metal-induced crystallization process and thereby stimulate the development of novel crystalline semiconductor-based technologies.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Engineering","Materials Engineering"]},{"id":"9789814411875","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Solar Power for the World","authors":["Wolfgang Palz"],"pages":"800","publication_date":"October 2013","description":"The book describes the industrial revolution associated with the implementation of electric power generation by photovoltaics (PV).

The opening chapters explore the 'encoding' view of flashbulb memory formation and critically appraise a number of lines of research that have opposed this view. It is concluded that this research does not provide convincing evidence for the rejection of the encoding view. Subsequent chapters review and appraise more recent work which has generally found in favour of the flashbulb concept. But this research too, does not provide unequivocal support for the encoding view of flashbulb memory formation. Evidence from clinical studies of flashbulb memories, particularly in post-traumatic stress disorder and related emotional disturbances, is then considered. The clinical studies provide the most striking evidence of flashbulb memories and strongly suggest that these arise in response to intense affective experiences. Neurobiological models of memory formation are briefly reviewed and one view suggesting that there may be multiple routes to memory formation is explored in detail. From this research it seems possible that there could be a specific route for the formation of detailed and durable memories associated with emotional experiences. In the final chapter a cognitive account of flashbulb memories is outlined. This account is centred on recent plan-based theories of emotion and proposes that flashbulb memories arise in responses to disruptions of personal and cultural plans. This chapter also considers the wider functions of flashbulb memories and their potential role in the formation of generational identity.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Science","Psychology"]},{"id":"9781439866771","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Plasma Processing of Nanomaterials","authors":["R.

Building robotics system in the micro scale is an engineering task that has resulted in many important applications, ranging from micromanufacturing techniques to cellular manipulation. However, it is also a very challenging engineering task. One of the reasons is because many engineering ideas and principles that are used in larger scales do not scale well to the micro-scale. For example, locomotion principles in a fluid do not function in the same way, and the use of rotational motors is impractical because of the difficulty of building of the required components.\n\nMicrorobotics is an area that is acknowledged to have massive potential in applications from medicine to manufacturing.

Although the profits enjoyed by the oil and gas industry are enormous, the industry remains one of the most capital-intensive in a world where rising expenses continue to threaten to squeeze profit margins.Geopolitics may continue to be the most important variable in maintaining existing assets and in successfully achieving new discoveries and carrying out their subsequent development. But finding new oil and gas reserves is becoming more challenging and the places where hydrocarbons are being found are more remote. Thus technology advances are also a key variable to enable exploration, drilling and development to become economically feasible in some of these more difficult operating environments.For the last century oil and gas additions have exceeded demand but has this industry now reached a \"peak oil\" situation? Some experts argue we are on the cusp of maximum oil production while others suggest we are still about a decade away. Natural gas demand however, is rising at a slightly faster rate than oil. Natural gas may be the immediate replacement fuel for oil as a source of clean and efficient electric power generation. Three out of the top ten Fortune 500 companies were oil/gas companies in 2011. This short introduction to the oil and gas industry will focus on history, operations, major companies, outside market forces, regulation and the current challenges the industry faces. Such factors as finite natural resources, the environment, economics, geopolitics, and technology will all come into play in the narrative. The book will demonstrate how the leaders of this industry, former champions of progress, are now coming under scrutiny and being depicted as the biggest culprits of environmental degradation. Yet the industry is likely to continue to grow until some form of alternate fuels is developed. The oil and gas industry will continue to have an enormous impact on life on the planet.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Engineering","Oil & Gas"]},{"id":"9781628256246","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Incentivizing Collaborative BIM-Enabled Projects: A Synthesis of Agency and Behavioral Approaches","authors":["Chen-Yu Chang"],"pages":"197","publication_date":"October 2018","description":"The use of digital representations to aid in projects—Building Information Modeling (BIM)—is gaining traction worldwide as an effective and beneficial approach to executing projects that can reduce errors and improve project results. These crucial benefits are prompting many businesses and governments to mandate its use, while others search for ways to grow and incentivize the practice.\n\nIn Incentivizing Collaborative BIM-Enabled Projects: A Synthesis of Agency and Behavioral Approaches, Chen-Yu Chang, PhD, explains the current state of BIM use in three distinct countries: China, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Following multiple case studies in each country, Professor Chang explores the explicit and implicit motivators that may drive BIM participation and the factors that can influence its effectiveness.\n\nThe case studies offer multiple perspectives on why and how BIM-enabled projects are adopted and provide a lens for understanding BIM at varying levels of maturity and in different environments. Understanding the motivators behind the current state of BIM-enabled projects facilitates the design of incentive structures for future BIM projects.\n\nAs BIM continues to evolve and transform the industry, this research provides valuable insight into the best practices for incentivizing its use. This theoretical approach gives researchers and organizations new tools and ideas to help build their own strategies to encourage BIM use and better understand its place in managing projects.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Mergers and Acquisitions"]},{"id":"9780470046456","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Microsoft® Outlook® 2007 Bible","authors":["Peter G.

More than half of us will die from complex diseases that trace directly to those vulnerabilities, and the modern world we’ve created places us at unprecedented risk from them. In It Takes a Genome, Greg Gibson posits a revolutionary new hypothesis: Our genome is out of equilibrium, both with itself and its environment. Simply put, our genes aren’t coping well with modern culture. Our bodies were never designed to subsist on fat and sugary foods; our immune systems weren’t designed for today’s clean, bland environments; our minds weren’t designed to process hard-edged, artificial electronic inputs from dawn ‘til midnight. And that’s why so many of us suffer from chronic diseases that barely touched our ancestors.\n\nGibson begins by revealing the stunningly complex ways in which multiple genes cooperate and interact to shape our bodies and influence our behaviors.

Thomas"],"pages":"220","publication_date":"October 2011","description":"Soft Landing: Airline Industry Strategy, Service, and Safety covers the immediate past, present, and future of the airline industry and its effects on consumers and the economy.\n\nAviation receives a disproportionate amount of news coverage in the popular press—not to mention chatter at cocktail parties and workplaces around the world. And why not? Aviation represents a sector of the U.S economy, for example, exceeded in size only by the real estate, healthcare, and automotive industries. Furthermore, hundreds of millions of people fly each year, including 80 million Americans.\n\nSo we all have airline stories—experiencing a delay and losing a business deal, spending a night or three in the airport, dealing with ornery airline personnel, losing money on airline stocks, or being involved in a near miss. (Or, as George Carlin more accurately put it, a \"near hit.\")\n\nBut things might be on the upswing. Knocked to its knees by 9/11 and a decade of falling revenue and rising losses, the industry's \"flying cheap\" strategy and organizational efficiencies based partly on outsourcing have appear to have helped passengers and profitability return. As this book explains, we can look forward to better technology and infrastructure, speedier—and easier—travel, more effective and less invasive security measures, and more jobs in the air and on the ground.\n\nTurbulence is always a possibility. Rising fuel costs, economic uncertainty, and future terror attacks could cause tumult once again. Plus, airline companies intend to charge us extra for everything from the weight of our own bodies to use of the bathroom. But as the industry has discovered, we'll put up with that—and more—if we can make it to our destinations with bags intact and a smaller dent in our wallets.\n\nSoft Landing will:\n\nSort out the promise and perils facing the airlines\n\nAnalyze and articulate the potential impact of changes in the aviation industry on passengers, airports, governments, the global economy, and the airlines themselves\n\nGive airline passengers worldwide an idea of what's ahead when it comes to airline service, security, and technology\n\nWhat you'll learn\n\nHow the airline industry has become the world's greatest \"loss leader\"\n\nWhat globalization does and does not mean for the industry\n\nHow terrorists will become more innovative in continued attempts to destroy airplanes and airports\n\nHow technology and new, innovative aircraft will make flying easier, faster, and more fun\n\nHow aviation security will evolve\n\nWhat the consolidation of major carriers means for consumers\n\nWhy airline employee unions in the U.S. will not survive in their present form\n\nWhat air travel will be like in the future\n\nWhy air travel is exponentially cheaper than at any other time in history and what the \"flying cheap\" strategy means\n\nWho this book is for\n\nThe millions of people currently employed by some facet of the airline industry (2 million in the U.S. alone), not to mention the hundreds of millions of people worldwide who fly each year. This book will also interest investors still trying to make money on airline stocks after all these years, government officials pondering economic development or bond issues for airports, security officials and entrepreneurs whose livelihoods are tied to aviation, travel agents, manufacturers, and many others.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Engineering","Aeronautics"]},{"id":"9780735623040","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Microsoft® Office Excel® 2007 Step by Step","authors":["Curtis D.

However, the hard truth is that alternative fuels can’t fully replace fossil fuels for decades. What’s more, new research indicates that energy inefficiencies are retarding economic growth even more than most experts ever realized.\n\nCrossing the Energy Divide is about solving all these problems at once. The authors, two leading experts in energy and environmental economics, show how massive improvements in energy efficiency can bridge the global economy until clean renewables can fully replace fossil fuels.\n\nRobert and Edward Ayres demonstrate how we can radically reform the way we manage our existing energy systems to double the amount of “energy service” we get from every drop of fossil fuel we use.\n\nThese techniques require no scientific breakthroughs: Many companies and institutions are applying them right now, but tens of thousands more could.

One of the many outstanding features of this system was the built-in Relational Database Management System (RDMS) support. The system included a utility for defining databases, screens, and reports. This utility used a form named Data Description Specifications (DDS) to define the database physical (PF) and logical (LF) files (base tables, views, and indexes).\n\nIn 1988, IBM announced the AS/400. The OS/400 operating system also contained a built-in RDMS, however, IBM offered Structured Query Language (SQL) as an alternative to DDS for creating databases.

With the advent of multicore processors and high performance computing (HPC) technology, the EM software designers need to know how to add new functionality to computational EM codes so that they can run efficiently on these new processors.\n\nHigher Order Basis Based Integral Equation Solver [HOBBIES] presents a road map for the analysis of complex material structures using the high-performance parallel simulation software known as HOBBIES. Focusing on the Method of Moments (MoM), the book features new parallel programming techniques and user-friendly code with superior capabilities for solving challenging EM radiation and scattering problems. It provides readers with complete guidance on how to extend the capability of MoM and achieve faster and more accurate EM analysis and utilize multicore CPUs on desktop computers. Complete with an academic version of the HOBBIES software, this book:\n\nExplains the unique features of the higher order basis functions in the solution of integral equations in a MoM context\n\nShows how to generate a properly load balanced parallel computational procedure for MoM matrix filling and matrix equation solving in both in-core and out-of-core implementation\n\nPresents a professional graphical users interface (GUI) for generating the geometrical structure based on NURBS modeling\n\nIllustrates various automatic meshing procedures based on an a-priori defined error between the actual geometry and the meshed structure\n\nOutlines all the key features of the HOBBIES software, including multiple optimization procedures for EM synthesis\n\nThe bottleneck of traditional MoM arises from the lack of memory in computers for solution of large problems. This is mitigated by using higher order basis functions and out-of-core solver in HOBBIES. HOBBIES has the capability to perform numerically accurate EM simulations using thousands of CPU cores in an HPC environment using a properly load balanced out-of-core solver. In this way, it provides a cost-effective choice for addressing modern engineering and scientific challenges that arise from the extremely complicated real-life applications.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Math"]},{"id":"9781119518167","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Excel Data Analysis For Dummies, 4th Edition","authors":["Paul McFedries"],"pages":"352","publication_date":"November 2018","description":"Take Excel to the next level\n\nExcel is the world’s leading spreadsheet application.

Providing both an historical and a business-minded context, this extensive resource describes the unique scientific and engineering techniques used to create these beautiful, clever, and eminently useful devices.\n\nIn this book, the history of the science and technology behind the LCD is described in a prelude to the development of the device, presenting a rational development theme and pinpointing innovations. The book begins with Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism, and the ultimately profound realization that light is an electromagnetic wave and an electromagnetic wave is light.\n\nThe power of mathematical physics thus was brought to bear upon the study of light, and particularly the polarization of light by material bodies, including liquid crystals. After a brief historical description of polarization, a physical interpretation provides substance to the mathematical concepts. Subsequent chapters cover:\n\nThermodynamics for liquid crystals\n\nThe Maier-Saupe mean field, phenomenological, static continuum, and dynamic continuum theories\n\nThe transistor and integrated circuit\n\nGlass, panels, and modules\n\nThe calculus of variations\n\nThe active matrix\n\nSemiconductor fabrication\n\nThe global LCD business\n\nAdditionally, the book illustrates how mathematics, physics, and chemistry are put to practical use in the LCDs we use every day. By describing the science from an historical perspective and in practical terms in the context of a device very familiar to readers, the book presents an engaging and unique view of the technology for everyone from science students to engineers, product designers, and indeed anyone curious about LCDs.\n\nSeries Editor: Anthony C. Lowe, The Lambent Consultancy, Braishfield, UK\n\nThe Society for Information Display (SID) is an international society, which has the aim of encouraging the development of all aspects of the field of information display. Complementary to the aims of the society, the Wiley-SID series is intended to explain the latest developments in information display technology at a professional level.

However, these new applications bring with them a new set of challenges. With coverage ranging from the basics to new and emerging applications, Compact Plasma and Focused Ion Beams discusses how compact high-density microwave plasmas with dimensions smaller than the geometrical cutoff dimension can be generated and utilized for providing focused ion beams of various elements.\n\nStarting with the fundamentals of the cutoff problem for wave propagation in waveguides and plasma diagnostics, the author goes on to explain in detail the plasma production by microwaves in a compact geometry and narrow tubes. He then thoroughly discusses wave interaction with bounded plasmas and provides a deeper understanding of the physics. The book concludes with an up-to-date account of recent research on pulsed microwaves and the application of compact microwave plasmas for multi-element FIB.\n\nIt provides a consolidated and unified description of the emerging areas in plasma science and technology utilizing wave-based plasma sources based on the author’s own work and experience.

This weakening of plastic material is called fatigue. Tribology is the science and technology of surfaces in contact with each other and therefore covers friction, lubrication and wear. The reduction of wear and fatigue and the improvement of lubrication are key bottom-line issues for engineers and scientists involved in the plastics industry and product design with plastics.Fatigue and Tribological Properties of Plastics and Elastomers, Second Edition is an update of all that has changed in the world of plastics since the 1st edition appeared nearly 15 years ago, and has been reorganized from a polymer chemistry point of view.\nA hard-working reference tool: part of the daily workflow of engineers and scientists involved in the plastics industry and product design with plastics\nThe reduction of wear and fatigue and the improvement of lubrication are key bottom-line issues\nThe data in this book provide engineers with the tools they need to design for low failure rates","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Engineering","Materials Engineering"]},{"id":"9780470561720","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Twitter® Marketing For Dummies®","authors":["Kyle Lacy"],"pages":"310","publication_date":"November 2009","description":"An introductory guide to effectively using Twitter to grow your business!\n\nThe field of social media marketing is exciting, cutting-edge, and...open to almost anything!

While this practice is vital, it is also a costly aspect of the surface generation process. After investing more than 40 years of research into the theory of part surface generation, the author of Generation of Surfaces: Kinematic Geometry of Surface Machining considers an approach that provides optimal machining while factoring in the lowest possible cost.\n\nThis book presents the modern theory of part surface generation with a focus on kinematic geometry of part surface machining on a multiaxis (NC) machine, and introduces key methods for applying the DG/K-based approach to part surface generation. The DG/K approach is based on the results of research found in two main areas: differential geometry (DG) of surfaces, and kinematics (K) of rigid body in three-dimensional Euclidian space E3. It is an extremely powerful tool for solving a plurality of problems in mechanical/manufacturing engineering.\n\nThe text is presented in three parts: the basics, the fundamentals, and applications of part surface generation. The first part of the book provides an analytical description of part surfaces, details the principal elements of the theory of multiparametric motion of a rigid body in E3 space, and defines applied coordinate systems. The second half introduces the theory of part surface generation, and includes an analytical description of contact geometry, while the final portion illustrates the potential development of highly effective part surface generation methods.\n\nThe author illustrates the most complex features of the book with examples, explains all of the results of analysis mathematically, and uses just one set of input parameters—the design parameters of the part surface to be machined.\n\nThe book considers practical applications for part surface machining and cutting tool design. Developed for use with computer-aided design (CAD) and computer-aided machining (CAM), this text is useful for anyone starting work on new software packages for sculptured part surface machining on a multiaxis NC machine.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Engineering","Mechanical Engineering"]},{"id":"9783110633153","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Multivariate Algorithms and Information-Based Complexity","authors":["Fred J.

She has also experienced the system as a patient and as a family member of a critically ill patient. In The Antidote to Suffering, this 30-year healthcare veteran and patient-experience thought leader argues that the key to improving healthcare is to reduce the suffering—physical, psychological, and emotional—of patients and caregivers alike through Compassionate Connected CareTM.\n\nDrawing on her 360-degree perspective, Dempsey offers a comprehensive, detailed, evidence-based plan that addresses the clinical, operational, cultural, and behavioral dimensions of care that every patient and caregiver experiences, in every setting. When suffering decreases, Dempsey argues, outcomes improve for patients and those who care for them. A virtuous cycle takes hold, leading to increases in morale, loyalty, and productivity and results in a culture that drives quality, safety, and value. It paves the path for creating a new national healthcare culture—one that values compassion, fosters efficiency, and drives innovation\n\nThe Antidote to Suffering is the first book to explore the pervasiveness of suffering in our healthcare system, and to provide the strategies and tools to:\n\n* Identify and measure suffering throughout your organization\n\n* Create a system in which every clinical response is informed by compassion\n\n* Operationalize staff behavior to promote meaning and purpose\n\n* Increase productivity by building a culture of collaboration\n\nReducing human suffering isn’t just a moral imperative for healthcare providers.

The book shows a solid grasp of the issues surrounding IT for business, and is written in a jargon-free style that will be easy for you to follow.\n\nOne option you have in the downturn is to choose innovative solutions. Mitchell offers you a cool appraisal of the advantages and disadvantages of Open Source Software in helping you to cut costs. The book also considers whether cloud computing is the right answer if you are looking to economise on server management and administration.\n\nBenefits to business include:\n\nCut unnecessary expenses Are you spending thousands on licences and maintenance for software that you never use? By identifying software that is lying idle and stripping out waste, you could save your company as much as £60,000!\nFreeze capital expenditure If your company frequently replaces its old PCs, this can put an unnecessary strain on budgets. By expanding the period between PC refreshes and pushing back new purchases, you will be making more use of what you already have and saving your business a fortune!\nNegotiate a better deal It’s not just your business that has to stay lean and mean in the recession: competition is fierce for your suppliers as well. Aim to renegotiate contracts with suppliers to cut a better deal for your business and drive down costs.\nCut your phone bill by 50 per cent The recession has highlighted the advantages of IP telephony (VoIP) as a means to reduce the cost of making phone calls. By switching the voice and data needs of your business over to a dedicated Internet circuit, you could save as much as 50 per cent on the cost of making calls.\n\nAs Stewart Mitchell comments, “A good examination of outgoings can highlight areas where the company is wasting money, or not getting the full dose for dollar.”\n\nIf you organisation is looking for way to make best use of IT resources then you need a copy of this essential guide!","tags":["Business","Project & Product Management","Product Management","Measuring IT / Software"]},{"id":"9780128128954","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Modern Machining Technology","authors":["Bijoy Bhattacharyya","Biswanath Doloi"],"pages":"780","publication_date":"September 2019","description":"Modern Machining Technology: Advanced, Hybrid, Micro Machining and Super Finishing Technology explores complex and precise components with challenging shapes that are increasing in demand in industry.

You're not alone. Meet Iris, a sales director so overwhelmed by meetings that she feels like a hamster on a wheel—in fact, she's turned into one. Just in time, she meets a coach—a leading meeting efficiency expert—with a simple system that helps her regain her sanity and humanity.The coach's secret is a laser-like focus on the five biggest meeting pain points:1. Meeting overload: Professionals waste twenty-four days a year in useless meetings.2. Missing success ingredients: ninety percent of all professionals attend meetings that lack a clearly stated objective and agenda.3. Virtual-meeting chaos: Disinterested participants + endless technical glitches huge amounts of wasted time.4. Agenda adrift: Goals are missed when meetings veer off course.5. Action distraction: Incomplete action items result in delayed projects and missed deadlines.The coach demonstrates that these five challenges are damaging Iris's career and costing the world over a trillion dollars each year. He provides practical new solutions that rapidly transform Iris from victim to victor. These solutions are tailored to the technology-driven world in which Iris lives—she discovers how to use e-calendars, PDAs, and virtual meetings to make her life easier, not more complicated. She applies the solutions, gets immediate results, and reclaims her life. The Hamster Revolution for Meetings focuses on a small number of high-impact best practices that really work.

The book shows that it is possible to achieve effective outcomes in large, important meetings - the kind of meetings that most organizations rely upon for aligning their leaders with strategy or managing change, innovation, and crises. When it matters most what the participants are thinking—even thousands of them at once, who may be in the room, at satellite locations or on laptops at home—this book liberates meeting designers from traditional assumptions and business-as-usual Q&amp;A and discussion tactics with an approach for hearing and working with the contributions of all participants, live. From the Introduction,\n\n\"Virtuous Meetings is a simple notion—give participants back their voice, and enable them to generate ideas, solutions and understandings that move the whole group, no matter how large, forward together.\"\n\nThe book shows how meetings can be virtuous in intent as well as design, and how technology can help in this work. The book shows the reader how to use Virtuous Meeting Cycles, in which all participants' voices are heard, and shared understanding is generated, which in turn is used by participants, as a group, to generate plans and solutions, over which all feel a sense of ownership. As participants and leaders see the value of the outcomes of their interactions, their trust in each other, in the process, and intent to do good increases. With an increase in trust, the engagement becomes fuller and more robust. And so each revolution of the cycle continues...\n\nThe book shows how to choose, anchor, design, facilitate, and scale virtuous meetings. In each part, the authors speak from the front lines—from experiences with clients and their critically important large meetings. The \"View from Inside the Meeting\" and Case Story features of the book share important lessons from some of the authors' most memorable engagements.\n\nAuthor Karl Danskin is an authority on psychology and group energetics. Lenny Lind is a pioneer in the field of technology-assisted group process and is a co-author of Facilitator's Guide to Participatory Decision-Making, by Sam Kaner, et al. Together, they draw on the collected experiences of over two decades of consulting to multinational corporations, having supported thousands of top-level client meetings, to share a methodology proven to engage participants like never before.\n\nTopics include:\n\nA new model for thinking about large meetings: Two levels of participant experience - table group, and whole group\n\nExploring the \"meta-conversations\" that virtuous meetings enable\n\nIntroducing the Virtuous Engagement Cycle\n\nThe heart of virtuous meeting design: The Design Team\n\nThe critical roles in a virtuous meeting\n\nAn expanded view of (and platform for) leadership\n\nParticipant-centered meetings of the future\n\nVirtuous Meetings is a comprehensive guide to getting the best out of large, strategically important meetings.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Communication","Meetings"]},{"id":"9780132255967","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Do It Wrong Quickly: How the Web Changes the Old Marketing Rules","authors":["Mike Moran"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"September 2007","description":"\"What's the one thing companies care about?

Radiation-induced chain cracking reactions in hydrocarbons at lowered temperatures initiated the development of improved technological approaches, combining the advantages of radiation-thermal cracking and low-temperature feedstock processing. However, researchers still face obstacles in the practical application of theory and experimental data, and the literature presents contradictions that need to be sorted out for further development of this technology.Petroleum Radiation Processing fills an information gap, providing systematic descriptions of the fundamentals of radiation-induced cracking reactions in hydrocarbons. It analyzes the basic experiments that have brought about the rapid development of radiation technology for petroleum radiation processing during the last decades. The book provides a detailed introduction to radiation methods based on radiation-thermal and low-temperature cracking of hydrocarbons, emphasizing high-viscous oil feedstocks that are difficult to process by conventional methods—such as heavy and high-paraffinic crude oil, fuel oil, and bitumen. It helps readers understand the mechanisms and kinetics of low-temperature radiation cracking. The book addresses the application of promising radiation methods for solving critical environmental issues, such as oil desulfurization and regeneration of used lubricants and other used oil products. Examining experimental data as well as theoretical and technical approaches, it summarizes research progress in the field of petroleum radiation processing, providing a useful reference on the theory and technology of hydrocarbon radiation processing for chemical technologists, researchers, and students.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Engineering","Oil & Gas"]},{"id":"9780735651227","language":"en","level":null,"title":"Microsoft® Word 2010 Plain & Simple","authors":["Katherine Murray"],"pages":"272","publication_date":"August 2010","description":"Get the guide that makes learning Microsoft Word 2010 plain and simple!

We know this because they’ve actively listed one or more of these things as interests under their real names right next to their profile photo.\n\nUnfortunately, the amount of people who hope to turn their creativity into a professional career wildly outnumber the very select few who actually end up doing so. Why is that? Are they lazy? Uninformed? Uninspired?\n\nIn reality, it’s none of the above. The biggest reasons many amazingly gifted people never pursue a career in creativity are because they don’t know where to start or how to do so.\n\nProfessional creativity has always been a bit of an enigma to those who seek it. The average person believes every artist is a starving one, while the average artist will tell you there is an impenetrable wall between commerce and art.\n\n¿\n\nNeither of these statements is true, and the end result of all this misinformation is that many incredibly talented people don’t realize that there are others like them out in the world making a (rather good) living by doing something they love.\n\nThis book provides a comprehensive list of creative jobs in advertising, career best practices, and advice from experts in their field, helping talented creative people:\n\nUnderstand the vast universe of creative occupations in advertising\n\nChoose which career path to follow\n\nMaster the social and business politics of the creative world\n\nLearn the truth about the Advertising industry (the good, the bad, and the ugly) from people who are already making money doing it\n\nThere are many books about teaching people how to be creative or how to find their inner creativity. This is not one of those books.\n\nCreativity isn’t something you can actually teach. You either have it, or you don’t.\n\nThis book is for those who have it. You’ve heard how ridiculously talented you are your whole life. People already crave your work and envy your skills. Friends ask you for favors. “A+” is the baseline for your art. Your work has graced the front of refrigerators, dorm rooms, and cubicles for years.\n\nThis book is for you–the rock stars, juggernauts, and creative beasts who know you’re talented, but don’t know how to use your skills to attain and maintain a career. Whether you want a solo career, your own business, a position at a well-known company, or a promotion from within, this book will be your guide.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Marketing","Digital Marketing","Social Media Marketing"]},{"id":"9780735647381","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Microsoft® Outlook® 2010 Plain & Simple","authors":["Jim Boyce"],"pages":"272","publication_date":"June 2010","description":"Get the guide that makes learning Microsoft Outlook 2010 plain and simple!

Our inboxes are flooded with spam, we have too many “friends” on Facebook, and our Twitter accounts have become downright unmanageable. Creating content is easy; finding what matters is hard.\n\nFortunately, there is a new magic that makes the Web work. It’s called curation, and it enables people to sort through the digital excess and find what’s relevant.\n\nIn Curation Nation, Steven Rosenbaum reveals why brands, publishers, and content entrepreneurs must embrace aggregation and curation to grow an existing business or launch a new one. In fact, he asserts that curation is the only way to be competitive in the future.\n\nOverwhelmed by too much content, people are hungry for an experience that both takes advantage of the Web’s breadth and depth and provides a measure of human sorting and filtering that search engines simply can’t achieve. In these shifting sands lies an extraordinary business opportunity: you can become a trusted source of value in an otherwise meaningless chaos of digital noise.\n\nIn Curation Nation, Rosenbaum “curates the curators” by gathering together priceless insight and advice from the top thinkers in media, advertising, publishing, commerce, and Web technologies. This groundbreaking book levels the playing field, giving your business equal access to the content abundance presently driving consumer adoption of the Web.\n\nAs the sheer volume of digital information in the world increases, the demand for quality and context becomes more urgent.

Critics argue that CBA forces values on unquantifiable factors, that it does not adequately measure benefits across generations, and that it is not adaptable in situations of uncertainty. Proponents, on the other hand, believe that a well-done CBA provides useful, albeit imperfect, information to policymakers precisely because of the standard metrics that are applied across the analysis. Largely absent from the debate have been practical questions about how the use of CBA could be improved. Relying on the assumption that CBA will remain an important component in the regulatory process, this new work from Resources for the Future brings together experts representing both sides of the debate to analyze the use of CBA in three key case studies: the Clean Air Interstate Rule, the Clean Air Mercury Rule, and the Cooling Water Intake Structure Rule (Phase II). Each of the case studies is accompanied by critiques from both an opponent and a proponent of CBA and includes consideration of complementary analyses that could have been employed. The work's editors - two CBA supporters and one critic - conclude the report by offering concrete recommendations for improving the use of CBA, focusing on five areas: technical quality of the analyses, relevance to the agency decision-making process, transparency of the analyses, treatment of new scientific findings, and balance in both the analyses and associated processes, including the treatment of distributional consequences.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Engineering","Civil Engineering"]},{"id":"9780470537190","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Marketing in the Age of Google: Your Online Strategy Is Your Business Strategy","authors":["Vanessa Fox"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"May 2010","description":"Search has changed everything.

The authors demonstrate various aspects of smart corrosion management and persuasively make the case that there is a real difference between corrosion management and corrosion knowledge management.\n\nThe book contains seven chapters that each focuses on one important aspect of corrosion and corrosion management.\n\nCorrosion management is an issue that is not just corrosion science or corrosion engineering but rather a combination of both elements. To cover this paradoxical aspect of corrosion management, chapter 2 deals with some basic, introductory concepts and principles of corrosion and coating/painting (an important corrosion protection method) while chapter 3 explains the elements of smart corrosion management in detail. Another important principle of smart corrosion management is to be able to study the cost of corrosion, chapter 4 introduces important points in the economics involved in a smart corrosion management. As indicated earlier, corrosion engineering is also an integral part of corrosion management and thus chapter 5 looks at the engineering side of corrosion by detailing the example of Process Additives (EMPA). Chapter 6 for the first time looks at the possibility of using TRIZ (algorithm of invention) in corrosion management. Finally, chapter 7 presents the necessary elements for building a model that would explore the mutual interaction between corrosion and environment mainly by exploring the difference between environmental impact and environmental effect. Chapter 7 is also very important because the four models so far applied to estimate the cost of corrosion (Uhlig Method, Hoar Method, I/O method and LCC method) are not capable of suggesting any clear model or a sensible way of exploring the elements necessary to explain the impact of indirect costs of corrosion the most important of which being environmental damages imposed by corrosion.\n\nThis book is ideal for engineers, students, and managers working or studying corrosion, Corrosion Policy Decision Making is also an indispensable resource for professionals in the fields of upstream and downstream, on-shore/off-shore oil and gas, transportation, mining, power generation as well as major sectors of other strategic industries.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Science","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering"]},{"id":"9781315302492","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Business and Peace-Building","authors":["Carol Bond"],"pages":"186","publication_date":"July 2018","description":"This book provides both theory and practical solutions for CEO’s, line workers and managers in natural resources industries to benefit from making peace-focused, day-to-day business decisions.

The author also presents models for the connection of these renewable energy sources from large-scale to on-site and community power/microgrids. The models are explained through case studies in the developed and developing worlds that explore how technical evaluations are conducted, policy incentives implemented, and project finance applied.\n\nConsidering the increasing importance of renewable energy for climate change mitigation, this book provides an overview of how renewable energy sources are integrated into the grid to promote better understanding among students and business professionals in the utility sector and across industries. Most literature on grid interconnection is highly technical, assuming an in-depth understanding of electrical engineering. With the rise of clean technologies and the diversity of interconnection models, this guide fills a gap in the existing literature by equipping non-technical business managers with the salient information they need to make critical decisions for their organizations.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Engineering","Renewable Energy"]},{"id":"9783110752175","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"De Gruyter Handbook of Climate Migration and Climate Mobility Justice","authors":["Andreas Neef","Natasha Pauli","Bukola Salami"],"pages":"492","publication_date":"September 2024","description":"Accelerating climate change is widely predicted to have profound impacts on human mobility over the coming decades. Climate mobilities and immobilities invoke issues of justice and social inequality and pose numerous socio-cultural, health, economic, legal and political challenges. Current international legal frameworks and national governance mechanisms provide insufficient protection for people displaced by climate change who are often subjected to health risks, psychosocial trauma, human rights abuse, and even new climatic risks. At the same time, there is a need to better understand how climate change interacts with other mobility drivers and why many climate-affected people decide to stay put or remain trapped in at-risk locations. Drawing on a wide range of disciplinary traditions and featuring Indigenous voices and youth perspectives, this book introduces new conceptual frameworks and empirical studies to examine the unique challenges facing people on the move and those staying behind.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Science","Climate Change"]},{"id":"9780768683790","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"The Upgrader’s Guide to Microsoft Office System 2003","authors":["Mike Gunderloy","Susan Sales Harkins"],"pages":"360","publication_date":"August 2004","description":"Microsoft Office 2003 is the sixth version of Microsoft's best-selling Office suite.

Kane"],"pages":"7","publication_date":"January 2016","description":"Few CEOs of large companies leverage the power of Twitter to the fullest extent. As of September 2014, only 42 Fortune 500 CEOs had Twitter accounts. The authors argue that rather than waiting for impressions to be driven by the media or by individuals with ulterior motives, CEOs can use Twitter to help shape their public image and that of their companies.\n\nThe authors studied the Twitter activity of 25 CEOs of publicly traded companies who were active on Twitter and identified common patterns and themes. Based on the type of content tweeted most often, the authors classified the CEOs they studied into four groups: Generalists, Expressionists, Information Mavens, and Business Mavens.\n\nGeneralists used Twitter to share a wide range of content. At times they tweeted about personal opinions and interests; other times, they tweeted information closely related to the business (for example, strategy, existing products and services, customer references, etc.). However, on average they had the smallest networks among the groups of CEOs, perhaps because they were not sharing information that was unique.\n\nExpressionists used Twitter extensively for non-business content sharing. These CEOs shared their opinions about events and politics and gave their followers an insight into their daily lives. In many ways, they used Twitter as a brand-building platform for themselves as they do for their companies.\n\nInformation Mavens frequently shared links to information, news, and other happenings. However, they did not generally tweet information specific to their company, acting more like curators of content. As a result, relatively few people retweeted or “favorited” their tweets.\n\nBusiness Mavens used Twitter extensively and primarily shared business-related content. In contrast to the other CEO groups that the authors identified, Business Mavens often shared new product announcements, information about existing products, customer references, and information about management initiatives and strategy. Although they also used Twitter to share content related to personal opinions and interests and links to other interesting information, the majority of their tweets were business-related. As a group, the Business Mavens produced tweets that were retweeted and favorited more often than those of CEOs in the other three groups, and they had significantly larger follower networks.\n\nThe authors’ research suggests that certain types of CEO tweets are more likely to be favorited and retweeted than others: tweets that provide new information about the company’s products and services; tweets that refer to external validation; and tweets that share customer stories and refer to customers.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Marketing","Digital Marketing","Social Media Marketing"]},{"id":"53863MIT59236","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Surviving in an Increasingly Digital Ecosystem","authors":["Peter Weill","Stephanie L.

The popularity of consumer-generated content (CGC) has captured the consumer (i.e., user) as the producer, which has cause a power shift in the market from the companies to the consumers. When technology is paired with culture, it is inevitable that consumers are constantly changing their attitudes toward consumption to adapt to current trends. Thus, marketers are meticulously looking for information to keep current with the consumer market in order to maintain their market share. CGC relates closely to electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) and can be found in various online review sites, forums, blogs, company websites, as well as on social media platforms. Consumers’ contribution toward the content on the different digital media sites (including company’s website) is on voluntary basis, either paid (e.g., sponsored) or nonpaid (e.g., personal blogs). It is evident that information that is published online travels faster to consumers than when delivered through traditional media such as television. Companies are therefore trying to be proactive; and as part of their promotional efforts, they are turning to online media for the latest information on their target market, feedback on their company (e.g., criticism, praises), as well as information on their competitors. The goal of this book is to educate business owners, marketing practitioners, students, as well as marketing researchers in understanding the use of CGC and how it is beneficial for their marketing plan.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Marketing"]},{"id":"9780133100310","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Google+ for Small Businesses","authors":["Lynette Young"],"pages":"88","publication_date":"November 2012","description":"Small business owners: Use Google+ to generate and convert leads, build buzz, and deliver flat-out unbeatable service and support!

The blog logged 2 million hits in its first six weeks. When the local area council asked her to stop, an online firestorm ensued and the council reversed its decision. It’s a familiar story — every day, images or events with the potential to incite passions get captured digitally, posted to the Web, and “go viral.” With social media, people share their experiences with friends or followers, who share with more people. Seemingly insignificant occurrences can strike a nerve with a nascent virtual community, and unsuspecting parties must respond to a dicey new problem.\n\nThe capacity to generate causes and controversies almost instantly may be the most salient aspect of what authors Robert D. Austin and David M. Upton call the “super-transparent society.”\n\nHistorically, the authors explain, people in a particular community were the only ones who paid attention to the local goings-on. When information moved outside of that environment, it was due to deliberate action: some identifiable person or organization moving it. If you wanted to guard information, you built a barrier. Many things have changed, particularly the volume of information.\n\nThe article suggests several steps that can help managers meet the new expectations for transparency, including the following:\n\nExamine your assumptions about how you can keep information contained.\n\nReview your strategy for dealing with vulnerability to unintended transparency.\n\nReview operations for issues that might be problematic if revealed.\n\nAssume that others will put out information about your organization for their own reasons and that you won’t be able to prevent it.\n\nRecognize that new information flows change what people consider to be fair.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Marketing","Content Marketing"]},{"id":"53863MIT59231","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Leading in a Time of Increased Expectations","authors":["Paul Michelman"],"pages":"6","publication_date":"January 2018","description":"Traditionally, the focus of big energy companies has been on power generation and maintaining andmanaging their assets. But in electric power, as in many businesses, today's consumers want convenienceand answers in real time. Since taking over as CEO of Duke Energy Corp., a large energy companybased in Charlotte, North Carolina, Lynn Good has faced the challenge of reorienting an old-line businessto meet the needs of today's customers. As Good says, \"We have to keep up with what customersexpect from an experience: information, control, convenience, and choice. People expect that from theirenergy provider just as they do with all the other services in their lives.\"In this interview with MIT Sloan Management Review editor in chief Paul Michelman, Good discussesthree big changes that are affecting the electric power industry: customer expectations, technology,and public policy. She explains how she is attempting to reshape Duke Energy, which has 29,000employees, around what she calls \"our leadership imperative.\" The imperative, says Good, is composedof five elements. The first element involves a commitment to \"live\" the company's core purpose andmission of serving its customers 24/7, during every season. The second element is knowing how to leadchange and guiding the organization \"toward the vision in an agile, flexible way.\" The third element isthe need to deliver outcomes to customers and other stakeholders \"with safety, integrity, and customerservice.\" The fourth is to \"work as one\" to meet customer needs.

Kumar"],"pages":"7","publication_date":"October 2012","description":"With the growth of social media, influencing consumer preferences and purchase decisions through online social networks and word of mouth is an increasingly important part of every marketer’s job. Companies such as Geico, Dell and eBay are adapting the traditional “one-way” advertising message and using it as a stepping-stone to begin a two-way dialogue with consumers via social media.\n\nMarketers know that theoretically, social media should be a powerful way to generate sustainable, positive word-of-mouth marketing. If marketers can only select the right social media platform, design the right message and engage the right users to spread that message, their campaign should be a success. But until now, that’s been a big if.\n\nThe authors propose a seven-step framework for success in social media marketing campaigns. Their framework involves identifying social media users who are not only influential but also particularly interested in the company’s product or service category and then recruiting and incentivizing those influencers to talk about the company’s product or service. The authors describe the implementation of their seven-step framework at Hokey Pokey Ice Cream Creations, an upscale ice-cream retailer with more than a dozen outlets across India. Hokey Pokey’s social media campaign resulted in substantial increases in brand awareness, social media ROI and sales revenue growth rate for the company. The authors also explain three new metrics they developed for use in social media marketing campaigns: the Customer Influence Effect, which measures the influence a social media user has on other users in the network; the Stickiness Index, which helps identify social media users who actively discuss the company’s product or service category; and Customer Influence Value, which helps measure the monetary gain or loss realized by a company in social marketing campaigns by accounting for an individual’s influence on purchases by other customers and prospects.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Marketing","Digital Marketing","Social Media Marketing"]},{"id":"9781118057629","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"System Analysis and Design, Fifth Edition","authors":["Alan Dennis","Barbara Haley Wixom","Roberta M.

Why, then, do parents, schools and employers insist that we restrict our many talents and interests; that we 'specialise' in just one?We've been sold a myth, that to 'specialise' is the only way to pursue truth, identity, or even a livelihood. Yet specialisation is nothing but an outdated system that fosters ignorance, exploitation and disillusionment and thwarts creativity, opportunity and progress. Following a series of exchanges with the world’s greatest historians, futurists, philosophers and scientists, Waqas Ahmed has weaved together a narrative of history and a vision for the future that seeks to disrupt this prevailing system of unwarranted ‘hyper-specialisation.’ In The Polymath, Waqas shows us that there is another way of thinking and being. Through an approach that is both philosophical and practical, he sets out a cognitive journey towards reclaiming your innate polymathic state. Going further, he proposes nothing less than a cultural revolution in our education and professional structures, whereby everyone is encouraged to express themselves in multiple ways and fulfil their many-sided potential. Not only does this enhance individual fulfilment, but in doing so, facilitates a conscious and creative society that is both highly motivated and well equipped to address the complexity of 21st century challenges.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Math"]},{"id":"9781801819541","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Exam Ref AZ-104 Microsoft Azure Administrator Certification and Beyond - Second Edition","authors":["Riaan Lowe","Donovan Kelly"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"July 2022","description":"Exam Ref AZ-104 Microsoft Azure Administrator Certification and Beyond provides a comprehensive resource for mastering the Microsoft Azure platform.

Kimberly","Hamid Bouchikhi"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"October 2012","description":"Planning for post-merger integration typically focuses on operational issues, such as harmonizing product lines and financial and human resource information systems, and determining which employees are retained and which ones are let go. Attention is also paid to the identity of the merged enterprise in a superficial sense. The name of the acquirer may be retained, or a new logo may be created or a new name found.\n\nBut for organizations to achieve the psychological synergies required to realize economic synergies from mergers and acquisitions, the authors argue that executives need to attend to a more complex, deeper set of identity issues. These issues define the essence of the entity and give employees a clear answer to the question “Who are we?” and external stakeholders a clear answer to the question “Who are they?” The first question refers to an organization’s members’ view of what makes it unique among all other organizations. The second question captures what external audiences believe is the essence of the organization. Left unattended, these deeper identity issues will diminish engagement and will inevitably affect the performance of the merged entity.\n\nOperational integration post-merger is a necessary but not sufficient condition for successful performance. Careful attention to identity integration is also essential for success. The authors argue that there is no “one best way” and that in fact there are four distinct paths that can be followed to achieve identity integration: assimilation, federation, confederation and metamorphosis. Each of these paths represents a particular combination of the answers to two questions that managers must confront in anticipation of a merger or acquisition: What should be done with the identities that the parties to the merger bring with them (in other words, their historical identities)? And how should a common identity for the future be built?","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Mergers and Acquisitions"]},{"id":"9781000541298","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Research and Technical Writing for Science and Engineering","authors":["Meikang Qiu","Han Qiu","Yi Zeng"],"pages":"318","publication_date":"February 2022","description":"Engineering and science research can be difficult for beginners because scientific research is fraught with constraints and disciplines.

At any given time, the brain is collecting, filtering, and analyzing information and, in response, performing countless intricate processes, some of which are automatic, some voluntary, some conscious, and some unconscious.Cognitive neuroscience is one of the ways we have to understand the workings of our minds. It's the study of the brain biology behind our mental functions: a collection of methods--like brain scanning and computational modeling--combined with a way of looking at psychological phenomena and discovering where, why, and how the brain makes them happen.Want to know more? Mind Hacks is a collection of probes into the moment-by-moment works of the brain. Using cognitive neuroscience, these experiments, tricks, and tips related to vision, motor skills, attention, cognition, subliminal perception, and more throw light on how the human brain works. Each hack examines specific operations of the brain. By seeing how the brain responds, we pick up clues about the architecture and design of the brain, learning a little bit more about how the brain is put together.Mind Hacks begins your exploration of the mind with a look inside the brain itself, using hacks such as \"Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation: Turn On and Off Bits of the Brain\" and \"Tour the Cortex and the Four Lobes.\" Also among the 100 hacks in this book, you'll find:\n\nRelease Eye Fixations for Faster Reactions\nSee Movement When All is Still\nFeel the Presence and Loss of Attention\nDetect Sounds on the Margins of Certainty\nMold Your Body Schema\nTest Your Handedness\nSee a Person in Moving Lights\nMake Events Understandable as Cause-and-Effect\nBoost Memory by Using Context\nUnderstand Detail and the Limits of Attention\nSteven Johnson, author of \"Mind Wide Open\" writes in his foreword to the book, \"These hacks amaze because they reveal the brain's hidden logic; they shed light on the cheats and shortcuts and latent assumptions our brains make about the world.\" If you want to know more about what's going on in your head, then Mind Hacks is the key--let yourself play with the interface between you and the world.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Development","Memory Improvement / Mental Exercise"]},{"id":"9780138262013","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Exam Ref DP-900 Microsoft Azure Data Fundamentals, 2nd Edition","authors":["Nicola Farquharson"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"May 2024","description":"Prepare for Microsoft Exam DP-900 and demonstrate your real-world foundational knowledge of core data concepts and how they are implemented using Microsoft Azure data services.

As a result, a significant share of highly intermittent but clean renewable sources is being integrated into the power system using advanced technological components. The higher penetration level of renewable energy sources (RESs) has increased the active power generation share in the grid but reduced the total rotating system inertia. This high reduction in inertia brings new challenges and technical issues to the operators of modern power systems and impacts the stability and security of the grid.\n\nThe stochasticity of these renewable sources also poses a big challenge to the efficient operation of the power system. Electrical energy storage systems help to manage such issues and challenges that occur due to the intermittent nature of RES and can play a big role in the smooth and reliable operation of the power system. The applications and opportunities to use storage on the grid are growing due to the improvements in energy storage technologies, and flexible regulatory frameworks. Technological developments have made it possible to use batteries and other Energy Storage Systems (ESSs) for managing the operation of the power system.\n\nThis book aims to illustrate the potential of energy storage systems in different applications of the modern power system considering recent advances and research trends in storage technologies. These areas are going to play a very significant role in future smart grid operations. This book discusses the various types of energy storage technologies and promotes the applications of ESSs in the performance improvement of modern power systems.

Current merging of Quantum Theory and Deep Learning techniques provides a need for a text that can give readers insight into the algebraic underpinnings of these disciplines. Although analytical, topological, probabilistic, as well as geometrical concepts are employed in many of these areas, algebra exhibits the principal thread. This thread is exposed using Many-Sorted Algebras (MSA). In almost every aspect of Quantum Theory as well as Deep Learning more than one sort or type of object is involved. For instance, in Quantum areas Hilbert spaces require two sorts, while in affine spaces, three sorts are needed. Both a global level and a local level of precise specification is described using MSA. At a local level operation involving neural nets may appear to be very algebraically different than those used in Quantum systems, but at a global level they may be identical. Again, MSA is well equipped to easily detail their equivalence through text as well as visual diagrams. Among the reasons for using MSA is in illustrating this sameness. Author Charles R. Giardina includes hundreds of well-designed examples in the text to illustrate the intriguing concepts in Quantum systems. Along with these examples are numerous visual displays. In particular, the Polyadic Graph shows the types or sorts of objects used in Quantum or Deep Learning. It also illustrates all the inter and intra sort operations needed in describing algebras. In brief, it provides the closure conditions.

For solving complex calculations and presenting results, Excel is amazingly complete with every imaginable feature already in place. But programming Excel isn't about adding new features as much as it's about combining existing features to solve particular problems. With a few modifications, you can transform Excel into a task-specific piece of software that will quickly and precisely serve your needs. In other words, Excel is an ideal platform for probably millions of small spreadsheet-based software solutions.\n\nThe best part is, you can program Excel with no additional tools. A variant of the Visual Basic programming language, VB for Applications (VBA) is built into Excel to facilitate its use as a platform. With VBA, you can create macros and templates, manipulate user interface features such as menus and toolbars, and work with custom user forms or dialog boxes. VBA is relatively easy to use, but if you've never programmed before, Programming Excel with VBA and .NET is a great way to learn a lot very quickly. If you're an experienced Excel user or a Visual Basic programmer, you'll pick up a lot of valuable new tricks. Developers looking forward to .NET development will also find discussion of how the Excel object model works with .NET tools, including Visual Studio Tools for Office (VSTO).\n\nThis book teaches you how to use Excel VBA by explaining concepts clearly and concisely in plain English, and provides plenty of downloadable samples so you can learn by doing. You'll be exposed to a wide range of tasks most commonly performed with Excel, arranged into chapters according to subject, with those subjects corresponding to one or more Excel objects. With both the samples and important reference information for each object included right in the chapters, instead of tucked away in separate sections, Programming Excel with VBA and .NET covers the entire Excel object library. For those just starting out, it also lays down the basic rules common to all programming languages.\n\nWith this single-source reference and how-to guide, you'll learn to use the complete range of Excel programming tasks to solve problems, no matter what you're experience level.","tags":["Data","Spreadsheets","Microsoft Excel"]},{"id":"9781466568167","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Epidemiology of Electromagnetic Fields","authors":["Martin Roosli"],"pages":"368","publication_date":"June 2014","description":"Appeals to a Wide Audience\n\nFueled by more than 30 years of intensive research and debate on the impact of electromagnetic fields (EMF) on everyday life—starting with residential exposure to magnetic fields and the development of childhood cancer in the 70s and continuing with risk of exposure via wireless communications in present day—Epidemiology of Electromagnetic Fields addresses ongoing public and scientific controversy surrounding the possible effects of electromagnetic fields (EMF) to human health, and provides an in-depth introduction into the methodology of environmental epidemiology that is appropriate for all levels, from student to practicing engineer.\n\nExposure to EMF\n\nFocusing primarily on EMF examples, the author presents the general principles and methodological concepts in environmental epidemiology.

Furthermore, the authors demonstrate how the architecture enables readers to integrate an RF front-end with the digital back-end onto a single silicon die using standard ASIC design flow.\n\nTaking a bottom-up approach that progressively builds skills and knowledge, the book begins with an introduction to basic concepts of frequency synthesis and then guides the reader through an all-digital RF frequency synthesizer design:\n\nChapter 2 presents a digitally controlled oscillator (DCO), which is the foundation of a novel architecture, and introduces a time-domain model used for analysis and VHDL simulation\n\nChapter 3 adds a hierarchical layer of arithmetic abstraction to the DCO that makes it easier to operate algorithmically\n\nChapter 4 builds a phase correction mechanism around the DCO such that the system's frequency drift or wander performance matches that of the stable external frequency reference\n\nChapter 5 presents an application of the all-digital RF synthesizer\n\nChapter 6 describes the behavioral modeling and simulation methodology used in design\n\nThe final chapter presents the implementation of a full transmitter and experimental results.

This book presents the most widely employed approaches to plasmonics and the numerous applications associated with it. There are several underlying elements in plasmonics research. Advances in nanoscience and nanotechnology have made possible the fabrication of plasmonic nanostructures, deposition of thin films, and development of highly sensitive optical characterization techniques. The different approaches to nanostructuring metals have led to a wealth of interesting optical properties and functionality via manipulation of the plasmon modes that such structures support. The sensitivity of plasmonic structures to the changes in their local dielectric environment has led to the development of new sensing strategies and systems for chemical analysis and identification. The book discusses all of these aspects.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Engineering","Materials Engineering"]},{"id":"9780750679701","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Switching Power Supplies A - Z","authors":["Sanjaya Maniktala"],"pages":"528","publication_date":"June 2006","description":"The design of Switching Power Supplies has become one of the most crucial aspects of power electronics, particularly in the explosive market for portable devices. Unfortunately, this seemingly simple mechanism is actually one of the most complex and under-estimated processes in Power Electronics. Switching power conversion involves several engineering disciplines: Semiconductor Physics, Thermal Management, Control Loop theory, Magnetics etc, and all these come into play eventually, in ways hard for non-experts to grasp. This book grows out of decades of the author’s experience designing commercial power supplies. Although his formal education was in physics, he learned the hard way what it took to succeed in designing power supplies for companies like Siemens and National Semiconductor. His passion for power supplies and his empathy for the practicing or aspiring power conversion engineer is evident on every page.* The most comprehensive study available of the theoretical and practical aspects of controlling and measuring Electromagnetic Interference in switching power supplies, including input filter instability considerations. * Step-by-step and iterative approach for calculating high-frequency losses in forward converter transformers, including Proximity losses based on Dowell's equations.* Thorough, yet uniquely simple design flow-chart for building DC-DC converters and their magnetic components under typical wide-input supply conditions * Step-by-step, solved examples for stabilizing control loops of all three major topologies, using either transconductance or conventional operational amplifiers, and either current-mode or voltage-mode control.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Engineering","Electrical Engineering"]},{"id":"9781118871232","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Storyscaping: Stop Creating Ads, Start Creating Worlds","authors":["Gaston Legorburu","Darren McColl"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"April 2014","description":"How to use powerful tools to engage customers with your brand\n\nMarketers, technologists, and corporate leaders are looking for ways to more effectively connect consumers with their brand.

Directly useful in both military (DOD) and civilian (FAA) applications. The result of 20 years of research at MIT Lincoln Lab, this book is of the most significant tehcnological consequence for the industry. It actually solves the problem of low angle radar land clutter by showing the reader how to design and predict the performance of radars that operate in situations where land clutter prevalent. Radar land clutter constitutes the unwanted radar echoes returned from the earth's surface that compete against and interfere with the desired echoes returned by targets such as aircraft and other moving and stationary targets. The ability to accurately predict the effects of land clutter in surface radar has been an unsolved problem for many years. This book is comprehensive in addressing the topic, containing many interrelated results, each important in its own right. It unifies and integrates all the results so as to create a comprehensive, innovative, and unequaled work. The results of this book directly enable the reader to predict land clutter effects in surface radar. Modern military aircraft deliberately fly low to hide their presence from radars that are also dealing with land clutter. Depending on the terrain, the performance of the radar varies greatly from very good to very poor. This book helps radar engineers provide accurate assessments of ground clutter, thus bringing their ability to detect and operate against low flying aircraft to a much higher and much more consistent level.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Engineering","Radar"]},{"id":"9780470488676","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Pay-Per-Click Search Engine Marketing: An Hour a Day","authors":["David Szetela","Joseph Kerschbaum"],"pages":"432","publication_date":"August 2010","description":"The complete guide to a winning pay-per-click marketing campaign\n\nPay-per-click advertising-the \"sponsored results\" on search engine results pages-is increasingly being used to drive traffic to websites.

Higher temperature combustion is therefore being adopted to improve plant efficiency and to maintain net power output given the energy penalty that integration of advanced emissions control systems cause. However, such operating regimes also serve to intensify degradation mechanisms within power plant systems, potentially affecting their reliability and lifespan.Power plant life management and performance improvement critically reviews the fundamental degradation mechanisms that affect conventional power plant systems and components, as well as examining the operation and maintenance approaches and advanced plant rejuvenation and retrofit options that the industry are applying to ensure overall plant performance improvement and life management.Part one initially reviews plant operation issues, including fuel flexibility, condition monitoring and performance assessment. Parts two, three and four focus on coal boiler plant, gas turbine plant, and steam boiler and turbine plant respectively, reviewing environmental degradation mechanisms affecting plant components and their mitigation via advances in materials selection and life management approaches, such as repair, refurbishment and upgrade.

The accuracy requirements for the elementary floating-point operations are extended to the customary product spaces of computations including interval spaces. The mathematical properties of these models are extracted into an axiomatic approach which leads to a general theory of computer arithmetic. Detailed methods and circuits for the implementation of this advanced computer arithmetic on digital computers are developed in part two of the book. Part three then illustrates by a number of sample applications how this extended computer arithmetic can be used to compute highly accurate and mathematically verified results.

This has never been done before.\" -- Philip Kotler, from the Foreword\n\nConsidered the single most important thought leader in the world of management, Peter Drucker had an equally significant influence on the discipline of marketing. Although he didn’t approach marketing with the same systematic rigor he reserved for management, Drucker addressed the topic in detail in his wellknown treatises on the roles of profitability and leadership, the importance of innovation, and the need to seize new opportunities.\n\nDrucker on Marketing is the first comprehensive look at the marketing wisdom of one of modern history's most influential business thinkers.\n\nA former student of Peter Drucker, William Cohen has sifted through Drucker's huge body of work, singled out his most salient ideas on marketing, and constructed them into a framework that not only outlines Drucker's marketing philosophy but provides practical advice on how to achieve marketing goals in today's business setting. The book is organized into five thematic sections:\n\nThe Ascendancy of Marketing\nInnovation and Entrepreneurship\nDrucker's Marketing Strategy\nNew Product and Service Introduction\nDrucker's Unique Marketing Insights\n\nFor Drucker, profitability should not be the main focus of a business. The customer should be; the market should be. He didn't consider marketing as one of many tools to generate profits. Rather, he viewed marketing as the driving force of business, a philosophy for defining and capturing the most enriching customer opportunities.\n\nProviding unique insight into the mind of one of the twentieth century's greatest thinkers, Drucker on Marketing is an essential read for both marketing professionals and fans of Peter Drucker.\n\nPraise for Drucker on Marketing\n\n\"Bill Cohen's interpretation of Drucker's work has never been needed more than today, when marketing spells the difference between success and failure.\" -- Frances Hesselbein, President and CEO, The Frances Hesselbein Leadership Institute\n\n\"It is my desire that those in positions of influence, especially executives, professors, and students, take Cohen's advice in this book to heart and help their organizations to help us all.\" -- Joseph A.

So, believe me, anything he said about marketing is worth reading. There's no better thinker.\" -- Jack Trout, global marketing expert, President, Trout & Partners Ltd., and bestselling coauthor of Positioning\n\n\"Bill Cohen has synthesized and analyzed and brought to life the single subject that, in many respects, lies at the heart of all of Drucker's writing: how to create a customer.

So what can be done? The key to understanding the causes of disasters and mitigating their impacts is the concept of 'vulnerability'.\n\nMapping Vulnerability analyses 'vulnerability' as a concept central to the way we understand disasters and their magnitude and impact. Written and edited by a distinguished group of disaster scholars and practitioners, this book is a counterbalance to those technocratic approaches that limit themselves to simply looking at disasters as natural phenomena. Through the notion of vulnerability, the authors stress the importance of social processes and human-environmental interactions as causal agents in the making of disasters. They critically examine what renders communities unsafe - a condition, they argue, that depends primarily on the relative position of advantage or disadvantage that a particular group occupies within a society's social order. The book also looks at vulnerability in terms of its relationship to development and its impact on policy and people's lives, through consideration of selected case studies drawn from Africa, Asia and Latin America. Mapping Vulnerability is essential reading for academics, students, policymakers and practitioners in disaster studies, geography, development studies, economics, environmental studies and sociology.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Science","Geology"]},{"id":"9780124159785","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Sustainable Energy Management","authors":["Mirjana Golusin","Stevan Popov","Sinisa Dodic"],"pages":"384","publication_date":"December 2012","description":"While the last few decades have witnessed incredible leaps forward in the technology of energy production, technological innovation can only be as transformative as its implementation and management allows.

Interestingly, biomass production amounts to approximately 270 000 TWh per year, or roughly twice as much, whereas the official figure of biomass use for energy applications is 10-13% of the global energy use. This shows that biomass is not a marginal energy resource but more than capable of meeting all our energy and food needs, provided it is used efficiently. The use of food in generating energy has been extensively debated, but there is actually no need for it given the comprehensive resources available from agriculture and forestry waste.\n\nThis book discusses the biomass resources available and aspects like efficient energy use. One way of using energy efficiently is to use waste biomass or cellulosic materials in biorefineries, where production of fibers and products from fibers is combined with production of most chemicals we need in our daily life. Such products include clothes, soap, perfume, medicines etc. Conventional pulp and paper applications, bio-fuel for vehicles and even fuel for aviation as well as heat and power production are covered. The problem with biomass is not availability, but the difficulty to use the resources efficiently without harming the long-term productivity. This book covers all types of resources on a global scale, making it unique. Many researchers from all over the world have contributed to give a good coverage of all the different international perspectives.\n\nThis book will provide facts and inspiration to professionals, engineers, researchers, and students as well as to those working for various authorities and organizations.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Engineering","Fuel Cells"]},{"id":"9781637425787","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Proximity Marketing","authors":["Dr. Rajagopal Rajagopal"],"pages":"218","publication_date":"January 2024","description":"This book discusses emerging concepts and practices of proximity marketing through theoretical foundations, design arguments, and managerial analysis.

The new REVISED Second Edition published in September of 2002 provides 5 productivity tools free on the accompanying CD ROM. This software is also included on the Instructor's Manual CD ROM and complete instructions accompany each software program.In the REVISED Second Edition modern notation combines with state-of-the-art treatment of the most important subjects in digital design to provide the student with the background needed to enter industry or graduate study at a competitive level. Combinatorial logic design and synchronous and asynchronous sequential machine design methods are given equal weight, and new ideas and design approaches are explored. The productivity tools provided on the accompanying CD are outlined below:[1] EXL-Sim2002 logic simulator: EXL-Sim2002 is a full-featured, interactive, schematic-capture and simulation program that is ideally suited for use with the text at either the entry or advanced-level of logic design. Its many features include drag-and-drop capability, rubber banding, mixed logic and positive logic simulations, macro generation, individual and global (or randomized) delay assignments, connection features that eliminate the need for wire connections, schematic page sizing and zooming, waveform zooming and scrolling, a variety of printout capabilities, and a host of other useful features. [2] BOOZER logic minimizer: BOOZER is a software minimization tool that is recommended for use with the text. It accepts entered variable (EV) or canonical (1's and 0's) data from K-maps or truth tables, with or without don't cares, and returns an optimal or near optimal single or multi-output solution. It can handle up to 12 functions Boolean functions and as many inputs when used on modern computers. [3] ESPRESSO II logic minimizer: ESPRESSO II is another software minimization tool widely used in schools and industry. It supports advanced heuristic algorithms for minimization of two-level, multi-output Boolean functions but does not accept entered variables. It is also readily available from the University of California, Berkeley, 1986 VLSI Tools Distribution. [4] ADAM design software: ADAM (for Automated Design of Asynchronous Machines) is a very powerful productivity tool that permits the automated design of very complex asynchronous state machines, all free of timing defects. The input files are state tables for the desired state machines. The output files are given in the Berkeley format appropriate for directly programming PLAs. ADAM also allows the designer to design synchronous state machines, timing-defect-free. The options include the lumped path delay (LPD) model or NESTED CELL model for asynchronous FSM designs, and the use of D FLIP-FLOPs for synchronous FSM designs. The background for the use of ADAM is covered in Chapters 11, 14 and 16 of the REVISED 2nd Edition.[5] A-OPS design software: A-OPS (for Asynchronous One-hot Programmable Sequencers) is another very powerful productivity tool that permits the design of asynchronous and synchronous state machines by using a programmable sequencer kernel. This software generates a PLA or PAL output file (in Berkeley format) or the VHDL code for the automated timing-defect-free designs of the following: (a) Any 1-Hot programmable sequencer up to 10 states. (b) The 1-Hot design of multiple asynchronous or synchronous state machines driven by either PLDs or RAM. The input file is that of a state table for the desired state machine. This software can be used to design systems with the capability of instantly switching between several radically different controllers on a time-shared basis. The background for the use of A-OPS is covered in Chapters 13, 14 and 16 of the REVISED 2nd Edition.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Engineering"]},{"id":"073561511X","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Microsoft® Office Excel 2003 Inside Out","authors":["Craig Stinson","Mark Dodge"],"pages":"1056","publication_date":"September 2003","description":"Take your Microsoft Excel experience to the next level!

Theresa Breining","Jack J. Phillips"],"pages":"304","publication_date":"January 2008","description":"The Phillips ROI Methodology™ utilizes five levels of evaluation, which are essential in determining the return on investment.\n\nAt Level 1 - Reaction and Planned Action, attendee and stakeholder satisfaction from the meeting can be measured. Almost all organizations evaluate at Level 1, usually with a generic, end-of-meeting questionnaire. While this level of evaluation is important as a “stakeholder” satisfaction measure, a favorable reaction does not ensure that attendees have acquired new skills, knowledge, opinions or attitudes from the meeting.\n\nAt Level 2 - Learning, measurements focus on what participants learned during the meeting using tests, skill practices, role-plays, simulations, group evaluations, and other assessment tools. A learning check is helpful to ensure that attendees have absorbed the meeting material or messages and know how to use or apply it properly. It is also important at this level to determine the quantity and quality of new professional contacts acquired and whether existing professional contacts were strengthened due to the meeting. However, a positive measure at this level is no guarantee that what was learned or whether the professional contacts acquired will be used on the job.\n\nAt Level 3 - Job Applications, a variety of follow-up methods can be used to determine if attendees applied on the job what they learned or acquired at the meeting. The frequency and use of skills are important measures at Level 3. While Level 3 evaluations are important to gauge the success of the meeting, it still does not guarantee that there will be a positive business impact in the organization or for the attendee.\n\nAt Level 4 - Business Results, the measurement focuses on the actual business results achieved by meeting participants as they successfully apply the meeting material or messages. Typical Level 4 measures include output, sales, quality, costs, time and customer satisfaction. Although the meeting may produce a measurable business impact, there is still a concern that the meeting may cost too much.\n\nAt Level 5 - Return on Investment, this ultimate level of measurement compares the monetary benefits from the meeting with the fully-loaded meeting costs as expressed in the ROI formula.\n\nAll levels of evaluation must be conducted in order to determine the ROI of a meeting or event. The data collected should show a chain of impact occurring through the levels as the skills and knowledge learned (Level 2) are applied on the job (Level 3) to produce business results (Level 4).","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Communication","Meetings"]},{"id":"9781118959084","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Socially Savvy Advisor + Website: Compliant Social Media for the Financial Industry","authors":["Jennifer Openshaw","Amy McIlwain","Stuart Fross"],"pages":"368","publication_date":"December 2014","description":"The social media marketing bible for the financial industry\n\nThe Socially Savvy Advisor: Compliant Social Media for the Financial Industry is the complete guide to creating an effective social media strategy without breaking the big rules.

Most businesses realize that the dayswhen they relied on three national networks (ABC, NBC,and CBS) and a few national newspapers to advertise aregone; thus, they begin to find alternatives to standardizedadvertising. Many of them begin to adopt moreindividualized advertising approaches, empowered byInternet technologies.This book outlines three fundamental strategies of advertising:standardized, targeted, and individualized. Itdescribes each strategy in detail and discusses the prosand cons of each. The importance of collecting consumerinsights and incorporating those insights into advertisingmessages are also highlighted. Although a few high-technologycompanies, such as Google, Facebook, andAmazon, are showing success in delivering individualizedadvertising messages to consumers, this approach (includingboth personalization and customization) is not suitablefor all businesses. No single strategy is absolutely moreeffective than the others; however, inside you are given areal strategy based on a scrutiny of the value proposition ofthe business and expectations of consumers.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Marketing"]},{"id":"9780749449544","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"IQ and Personality Tests","authors":["Philip Carter"],"pages":"216","publication_date":"April 2007","description":"An interactive guide which helps everyone to assess their aptitude and personality traits though the use of questionnaires, as well as including tests of verbal and numerical ability.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Science","Psychology","Psychometric Tests"]},{"id":"9781449624736","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Introduction to Photovoltaics","authors":["John R.

This technology is just now being implemented into hardware and working its way into wireless standards such as the ubiquitous 802.11g, as well as third- and fourth-generation cellular standards.\n\nMultiple-Input Multiple-Output Channel Models uniquely brings together the theoretical and practical aspects of MIMO communications, revealing how these systems use their multipath diversity to increase channel capacity. It gives the reader a clear understanding of the underlying propagation mechanisms in the wideband MIMO channel, which is fundamental to the development of communication algorithms, signaling strategies, and transceiver design for MIMO systems.\n\nMIMO channel models are important tools in understanding the potential gains of a MIMO system. This book discusses two types of wideband MIMO models in detail: correlative channel models—specifically the Kronecker, Weichselberger, and structured models—and cluster models, including Saleh-Valenzuela, European Cooperation in the field of Scientific and Technical Research (COST) 273, and Random Cluster models. From simple to complex, the reader will understand the models' mechanisms and the reasons behind the parameters. Next, channel sounding is explained in detail, presenting the theory behind a few channel sounding techniques used to sound narrowband and wideband channels. The technique of digital matched filtering is then examined and, using real-life data, is shown to provide very accurate estimates of channel gains. The book concludes with a performance analysis of the structured and Kronecker models.\n\nMultiple-Input Multiple-Output Channel Models is the first book to apply tensor calculus to the problem of wideband MIMO channel modeling. Each chapter features a list of important references, including core literary references, Matlab implementations of key models, and the location of databases that can be used to help in the development of new models or communication algorithms. Engineers who are working in the development of telecommunications systems will find this resource invaluable, as will researchers and students at the graduate or post-graduate level.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Engineering","Electrical Engineering","Signal Processing"]},{"id":"9781860582813","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Optical Methods for Data Processing in Heat and Fluid Flow","authors":["Clive Greated","John Cosgrove","James Buick"],"pages":"304","publication_date":"August 2002","description":"Optical methods are now used routinely for the measurement of velocity, concentration, temperature, and other parameters in wide-ranging areas of industrial research and design such as IC engines, turbines, and combustors.\n\nRecent advances such as the use of high-resolution CCD cameras and the extension of flow mapping to three dimensions, make optical tools such as particle image velocimetry increasingly viable for use in the industrial environment.\n\nThis excellent book presents new developments in optical diagnostic techniques in heat and fluid flow and offers an unparalleled opportunity for industrialists and academic researchers to exchange ideas.\n\nCONTENTS INCLUDE:\n\nComparison of injector sprays for gasoline direct-injection engines\n\nThe design, development, and preliminary results from a high-speed, optically accessed, single cylinder engine\n\nThe reflected spectrum of complex multi-layered inhomogeneous highly scattering medium\n\nDevelopment of full volume digital holography for particle measurement\n\nImproved liquid crystal thermography by using true-colour image processing technology\n\nDevelopment of an optical measuring technique for the study of acoustical phenomena\n\nSpatio-temporal reconstruction of the unsteady wake of axisymmetric bluff bodies via time-recording DPIV\n\nApplication of particle image velocimetry to helicopter vortex interactions\n\nPulsed laser particle image velocimetry using a fibre-optic delivery system\n\nAutomated fringe analysis for profilometric mass-transfer experiments.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Science","Physics","Optics"]},{"id":"9781119734147","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Radio Science Techniques for Deep Space Exploration","authors":["Sami W.

Zihai Shi uses his extensive research experience to present detailed examination of multiple-crack analysis and mixed-mode fracture.Compared with other mature engineering disciplines, fracture mechanics of concrete is still a developing field with extensive new research and development. In recent years many different models and applications have been proposed for crack analysis; the author assesses these in turn, identifying their limitations and offering a detailed treatment of those which have been proved to be robust by comprehensive use. After introducing stress singularity in numerical modelling and some basic modelling techniques, the Extended Fictitious Crack Model (EFCM) for multiple-crack analysis is explained with numerical application examples. This theoretical model is then applied to study two important issues in fracture mechanics - crack interaction and localization, and fracture modes and maximum loads. The EFCM is then reformulated to include the shear transfer mechanism on crack surfaces and the method is used to study experimental problems. With a carefully balanced mixture of theory, experiment and application, Crack Analysis in Structural Concrete is an important contribution to this fast-developing field of structural analysis in concrete.* Latest theoretical models analysed and tested* Detailed assessment of multiple crack analysis and multi-mode fractures* Applications designed for solving real-life engineering problems","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Engineering","Civil Engineering"]},{"id":"9781119536093","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"A Polygeneration Process Concept for Hybrid Solar and Biomass Power Plant","authors":["Umakanta Sahoo"],"pages":"294","publication_date":"September 2018","description":"The global warming phenomenon as a significant sustainability issue is gaining worldwide support for development of renewable energy technologies. The term “polygeneration” is referred to as “an energy supply system, which delivers more than one form of energy to the final user.”  For example, electricity, cooling and desalination can be delivered from a polygeneration process. The polygeneration process in a hybrid solar thermal power plant can deliver electricity with less impact on the environment compared to a conventional fossil fuel-based power generating system. It is also THE next generation energy production technique with the potential to overcome the undesirable intermittence of renewable energy systems.\n\nIn this study, the polygeneration process simultaneous production of power, vapor absorption refrigeration (VAR) cooling and multi-effect humidification and dehumidification (MEHD) desalination system from different heat sources in hybrid solar-biomass (HSB) system with higher energy efficiencies (energy and exergy), primary energy savings (PES) and payback period are investigated, focusing on several aspects associated with hybrid solar-biomass power generation installations, such as wide availability of biomass resources and solar direct normal irradiance (DNI), and other technologies.  Thermodynamic evaluation (energy and exergy) of HSB power has also been investigated, along with the VAR cooling system, the modelling, simulation, optimization and cost analysis of the polygeneration hybrid solar biomass system, all accompanied by multiple case studies and examples for practical applications.\n\nThis volume provides the researcher, student and engineer with the intellectual tool needed for understanding new ideas in this rapidly emerging field.

Cochran","Anne T. Coughlan","Victoria L. Crittenden"],"pages":"174","publication_date":"September 2021","description":"The Power of Direct Selling.\n\nDirect selling is not an industry per se nor is it merely a go-to-market business model and channel to reach consumers. It is bigger than any of this – direct selling is people. The ability for people with entrepreneurial spirit to build a successful business, whether it be from the ground up or by representing a company’s product, is at the heart of direct selling and it is people who made (and continue to make) direct selling the successful marketplace that it is today. The direct selling marketplace is comprised of mission-driven and socially responsible companies offering a wide variety of product and services, and the list of direct selling companies is abundant with entrepreneurs who built their businesses by utilizing an independent salesforce channel to market and sell their products or services directly to consumers.\n\nPossibly one of the most prominent of these entrepreneurs is Mary Kay Ash, a legend as a glass-ceiling breaker and a woman who built a very successful business with a go-to-market strategy of direct selling. Unlike Mary Kay Ash, however, not all aspiring business owners are willing/able to invest their savings and time on a start-up business. These micro-entrepreneurs desire to have the economic and social benefits of managing their own businesses but do not want the startup costs and demands associated with traditional business planning. As such, becoming a direct selling distributor offers a low-risk, low-cost pathway to micro-entrepreneurship.\n\nThe traditional barriers to small business ownership are removed when a micro-entrepreneur builds a direct selling business that is backed by established brands. These established brands, several of which are featured in this book, offer the micro-entrepreneurs quality products, business training, and technological resources to achieve a self-determined metric of success.\n\nFramed within the context of entrepreneurship and an historical overview of the long-term sustainability of this business model, this book is intended for practitioners who want to read about the breadth and depth of direct selling. Importantly, this book provides considerable depth in terms of three particular issues associated with direct selling:\n\nCompensation,\nEthics & compliance, and\nGlobal reach.\n\nFor scholars, this book is built on a strong foundation of valid and reliable research endeavors. The authors have published research on direct selling in high quality, reputable and peer-reviewed academic and practitioner journals. Thus, this book can add foundationally to the research efforts of academics who are conducting research in a wide variety of topics (such as sales, women empowerment, business strategy, ethics, distribution models, gig economy, and global entry – to name a few), as well as to members of the press who want reliable and valid content upon which to build their stories.\n\nThe book’s content is also particularly informative for policymakers at the local, state, national, and international levels. For students, reading this book will offer a variety of insights, particularly related to the intricacies of channel selection and design. Direct Selling: A Global and Social Business Model is a collective project from eight academics and practitioners who have dedicated much of their careers to understanding direct selling as both a go-to-market strategy and a channel of distribution and to capturing the people who are the foundation of direct selling. The pages of this book bring together a wealth of research and knowledge that can inform a broad spectrum of constituents about the economic and social benefits of direct selling, while also providing detail and clarity on key issues related to direct selling as a sustainable business model.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Marketing"]},{"id":"53863MIT60313","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"When Patients Become Innovators","authors":["Harold DeMonaco","Pedro Oliveira","Andrew Torrance"],"pages":"10","publication_date":"April 2019","description":"Judgment bias has long been recognized and studied, particularly in the context of decision-making about hiring.

When change comes to the business model of such a mature industry, the pattern is often recognizable. The foundational elements of the industry shift, allowing the innovation of business models by new competitors, while established firms face the threat of disruption. The utility sector, after decades of relative stability, is in the midst of such a transformation today.\n\nAfter providing a historical summary of the dominant business models of the utility sector, Transformation of the Electric Utility Business Model looks at the factors currently impacting the industry. Utilities and policy makers today are facing two long-term issues that will dominate their agendas in the coming decades: rebuilding utility infrastructure to enable the decarbonization of the economy, and managing the risk of catastrophic events that can leave large areas without power for extended periods. Fortunately, with proper planning, many utility investments in decarbonization will also support risk management. However, these investments are often not compatible with current utility business models, requiring creativity and new regulatory frameworks to successfully implement. This book considers the impact of these factors, and then discusses the future.\n\nThis well-researched, extremely insightful book is essential reading for all those with an interest in business strategy, energy studies and sustainability.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Engineering","Electrical Engineering"]},{"id":"9780132658560","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Can We See the Invisible Mind of God?","authors":["The Chicago Social Brain Network"],"pages":"15","publication_date":"November 2010","description":"This Element is an excerpt from Invisible Forces and Powerful Beliefs: Gravity, Gods, and Minds (9780137075454) by the Chicago Social Brain Network.

The book then explains microfabrication, which presents knowledge on the common fabrication process to design realistic MEMS. From there, coverage includes:\n\nStatics/force and moment acting on mechanical structures in static equilibrium\n\nStatic behaviors of structures consisting of mechanical elements\n\nDynamic responses of the mechanical structures by the solving of linear as well as nonlinear governing equations\n\nFluid flow in MEMS and the evaluation of damping force acting on the moving structures\n\nBasic equations of electromagnetics that govern the electrical behavior of MEMS\n\nCombining the MEMS building blocks to form actuators and sensors for a specific purpose\n\nAll chapters from first to last use a unified approach in which equations in previous chapters are used in the derivations of closed-form solutions in later chapters. This helps readers to easily understand the problems to be solved and the derived solutions. In addition, theoretical models for the elements and systems in the later chapters are provided, and solutions for the static and dynamic responses are obtained in closed-forms.\n\nThis book is designed for senior or graduate students in electrical and mechanical engineering, researchers in MEMS, and engineers from industry. It is ideal for radio frequency/electronics/sensor specialists who, for design purposes, would like to forego numerical nonlinear mechanical simulations. The closed-form solution approach will also appeal to device designers interested in performing large-scale parametric analysis.","tags":["Hardware","Embedded Systems","Microelectronics"]},{"id":"9781843345725","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Evaluation of Research By Scientometric Indicators","authors":["Peter Vinkler"],"pages":"336","publication_date":"January 2010","description":"Aimed at academics, academic managers and administrators, professionals in scientometrics, information scientists and science policy makers at all levels.

H. Wu"],"pages":"416","publication_date":"July 2019","description":"The first book to provide a detailed overview of Geosynthetic Reinforced Soil Walls\n\nGeosynthetic Reinforced Soil (GRS) Walls deploy horizontal layers of closely spaced tensile inclusion in the fill material to achieve stability of a soil mass. GRS walls are more adaptable to different environmental conditions, more economical, and offer high performance in a wide range of transportation infrastructure applications. This book addresses both GRS and GMSE, with a much stronger emphasis on the former. For completeness, it begins with a review of shear strength of soils and classical earth pressure theories. It then goes on to examine the use of geosynthetics as reinforcement, and followed by the load-deformation behavior of GRS mass as a soil-geosynthetic composite, reinforcing mechanisms of GRS, and GRS walls with different types of facing. Finally, the book finishes by covering design concepts with design examples for different loading and geometric conditions, and the construction of GRS walls, including typical construction procedures and general construction guidelines.\n\nThe number of GRS walls and abutments built to date is relatively low due to lack of understanding of GRS. While failure rate of GMSE has been estimated to be around 5%, failure of GRS has been found to be practically nil, with studies suggesting many advantages, including a smaller susceptibility to long-term creep and stronger resistance to seismic loads when well-compacted granular fill is employed. Geosynthetic Reinforced Soil (GRS) Walls will serve as an excellent guide or reference for wall projects such as transportation infrastructure—including roadways, bridges, retaining walls, and earth slopes—that are in dire need of repair and replacement in the U.S. and abroad.\n\nCovers both GRS and GMSE (MSE with geosynthetics as reinforcement); with much greater emphasis on GRS walls\nShowcases reinforcing mechanisms, engineering behavior, and design concepts of GRS and includes many step-by-step design examples\nFeatures information on typical construction procedures and general construction guidelines\nIncludes hundreds of line drawings and photos\n\nGeosynthetic Reinforced Soil (GRS) Walls is an important book for practicing geotechnical engineers and structural engineers, as well as for advanced students of civil, structural, and geotechnical engineering.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Engineering","Civil Engineering"]},{"id":"9781647829766","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Terrible Beauty","authors":["Auden Schendler"],"pages":"256","publication_date":"November 2024","description":"A firsthand, trench-view story of the failure of the modern environmental movement—and an inspiring prescription for change.\n\nSomething's gone badly awry with environmentalism. We faithfully separate our waste into different streams, but wonder whether it really makes a difference. Global companies announce their commitment to carbon negativity while simultaneously sponsoring oil conferences. American businesses, communities, and individuals assiduously measure their carbon footprints, then implement voluntary emissions-reduction programs, all while trumpeting their do-gooderism.\n\nThe problem is, none of this—whether individual efforts or corporate sustainability tactics—will make a dent in solving the civilizational threat of climate change. We only pretend it will, at our peril.\n\nAs sustainability veteran Auden Schendler argues in this provocative, powerful book, we're living a big green lie. The hard truth is that much of the modern environmental road map could have been written by the fossil fuel industry specifically to avoid disrupting the status quo. We have become somehow complicit.\n\nBut there is another truth: while ineffective or duplicitous environmentalism has become standard practice, we all have friends and family we love and care about, whose future depends on solving the problem of climate change. Conscience tells us we have an obligation to repair the world. How can our common dreams be so at odds with our daily practice? And how might we meld our spirit and our passion to create a better future?\n\nSchendler meets this profound contradiction head-on—with a bracing critique, moving personal stories of parenthood and service, and innovative, real-world methods to tackle climate change at the corporate, community, and individual levels.\n\nTerrible Beauty is a unique and inspiring call for a new environmentalism, showing us that the key to saving the planet is to tap into our own humanity.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Science","Climate Change"]},{"id":"9781439852354","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Optical Wireless Communications","authors":["Z.

Economist John Tilton responds by analyzing recent trends in the consumption and availability of minerals that are most integral to the needs of modern civilization. He reminds readers that, if the arguments about scarcity sound familiar, it is because the story of minerals scarcity is almost as old as human history-and so too is substitution and technological innovation. The issue at hand is the unprecedented acceleration in exploitation and use. Given global population growth, rising living standards, and environmental concerns, how seriously should today‘s society take the threat of mineral exhaustion? On Borrowed Time? provides general interest and student readers with an accessible framework for understanding scarcity. Tilton defines important concepts and explores the methods used to study mineral scarcity, including physical measures of known reserves and the total resource base, and economic measures, such as extraction and end-user costs. He notes the increasing emphasis on the social and environmental costs of mineral production and use, placing the scarcity debate in context of broader concerns about sustainability and equity. He adds a history of thought about scarcity, from Malthus and Ricardo to Harold Hotelling, Donella Meadows, to the present day.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Engineering","Civil Engineering"]},{"id":"9780240809762","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Digital Signage Broadcasting","authors":["Lars-Ingemar Lundstrom"],"pages":"352","publication_date":"May 2013","description":"Digital Signage Broadcasting is a perfect introduction to this new world of opportunities for media professionals in all areas.

This is done through finite element methods (FEM) or statistical energy analysis (SEA) to cover the full frequency range. In the mid-frequency range, both methods must be combined into a hybrid FEM/SEA approach. By doing so, engineers can model full frequency vibroacoustic simulations in complex technical systems used in aircraft, trains, cars, ships, and satellites. Indeed, hybrid approaches are increasingly used in the automotive, aerospace, and rail industries.\n\nPreviously covered primarily in scientific journals, Vibroacoustic Simulation provides a practical approach that helps readers master the full frequency range of vibroacoustic simulation. Through a systematic approach, the book illustrates why both FEM and SEA are necessary in acoustic engineering and how both can be used in combination through hybrid methodologies.

With this framework, he introduces the reader to crucial concepts in signal processing such as continuous- and discrete-domain signals and systems, discrete-domain periodic signals, sampling and reconstruction, light and color, random field models, image representation and more. \n\nWhile most treatments use normalized representations for non-rectangular sampling, this approach obscures much of the geometrical and scale information of the signal. In contrast, Dr. Dubois uses actual units of space-time and frequency. Basis-independent representations appear as much as possible, and the basis is introduced where needed to perform calculations or implementations. Thus, lattice theory is developed from the beginning and rectangular sampling is treated as a special case. This is especially significant in the treatment of color and color image processing and for discrete transform representations based on symmetry groups, including fast computational algorithms. Other features include:\n\nAn entire chapter on lattices, giving the reader a thorough grounding in the use of lattices in signal processing\nExtensive treatment of lattices as used to describe discrete-domain signals and signal periodicities\nChapters on sampling and reconstruction, random field models, symmetry invariant signals and systems and multidimensional Fourier transformation properties\nSupplemented throughout with MATLAB examples and accompanying downloadable source code\n\nGraduate and doctoral students as well as senior undergraduates and professionals working in signal processing or video/image processing and imaging will appreciate this fresh approach to multidimensional signals and systems theory, both as a thorough introduction to the subject and as inspiration for future research.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Engineering","Electrical Engineering","Signal Processing"]},{"id":"9781098103576","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Managing and Recovering Microsoft 365 Data","authors":["Brien Posey"],"pages":"28","publication_date":"March 2021","description":"With more employees working remotely today, Microsoft 365 has become a go-to solution for many companies.

The NABCEP Entry-Level PV Exam ensures and reinforces that the professional has attained the basic knowledge of the fundamental concepts of PV system design, installation, and operation. Review Guide for the NABCEP Entry-Level Exam provides students with the information they need to successfully pass the exam. The organization of the text parallels that of the major exam sections and includes the essential concepts and principles that are covered on the exam.\n\nReview Guide for the NABCEP Entry-Level Exam is the stepping-stone resource for PV students to launch their career in the thriving photovoltaic industry.\n\nAbout the Series:\n\nThe Photovoltaics (PV) industry stands on the brink of a revolution. The appeal of a new and growing industry has brought an influx of new PV professionals to the market, but the availability of educational resources has not kept pace with market demands. This gap has led to serious quality and performance issues that the industry will need to face in the decades ahead.\n\nThe Art and Science of Photovoltaics series was developed to fill this education gap. Each book in the series goes beyond simple systematic processes by tackling performace challenges using a systems perspective. Readers do not learn PV design and installation steps in a vacuum; instead they gain the knowledge and expertise to understand interrelationships and discover new ways to improve their own systems and positively contribute to the industry.\n\n*NABCEP™ is a trademark exclusively owned and controlled by the North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners, Inc.

Martynenko"],"pages":"148","publication_date":"October 2023","description":"The organization of the material is presented as follows:\n\nThis introductory chapter I represents a theoretical analysis of the computational algorithms for a numerical solution of the basic equations in continuum mechanics. In this chapter, the general requirements for computational grids, discretization, and iterative methods for black-box software are examined. Finally, a concept of a two-grid algorithm for (de-)coupled solving multidimensional non-linear (initial-)boundary value problems in continuum mechanics (multiphysics simulation) in complex domains is presented.\n\nChapter II contains descriptions of the sequential Robust Multigrid Technique which is developed as a general-purpose solver in black-box codes. This chapter presents the main components of the Robust Multigrid Technique (RMT) used in the two-grid algorithm (Chapter I) to compute the auxiliary (structured) grid correction. This includes the generation of multigrid structures, computation of index mapping, and integral evaluation. Finite volume discretization on the multigrid structures will be explained by studying a 1D linear model problem. In addition, the algorithmic complexity of RMT and black-box optimization of the problem-dependent components of RMT are analysed.\n\nChapter III provides a description of parallel RMT. This chapter introduces parallel RMT-based algorithms for solving the boundary value problems and initial-boundary value problems in unified manner. Section 1 presents a comparative analysis of the parallel RMT and the sequential V-cycle. Sections 2 and 3 present a geometric and an algebraic parallelism of RMT, i.e. parallelization of the smoothing iterations on the coarse and the levels. A parallel multigrid cycle will be considered in Section 4. A parallel RMT for the time-dependent problems is given in Section 5. Finally, the basic properties of parallel RMT will be summarized in Section 6.\n\nTheoretical aspects of the used algorithms for solving multidimensional problems are discussed in Chapters IV. This chapter contains the theoretical aspects of the algorithms used for the numerical solving of the resulting system of linear algebraic equations obtained from discrete multidimensional (initial-)boundary value problems.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Math"]},{"id":"9783110624816","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Economic Dynamics with Memory","authors":["Vasily E.

This report features highlights from recent Strata+Hadoop World conferences to demonstrate how the petroleum industry uses data science in their operations today.\n\nOil companies use machine learning to mitigate short-term operational risk and to optimize long-term reservoir management. But, as author Naveen Viswanath explains, machine learning models alone can’t distinguish between good and bad data or reasonable and unreasonable results. Human intelligence—including a deep understanding of how data sources fit into business use cases—is crucial for making these distinctions.\n\nWith this report, you’ll learn the challenges these companies face when collecting a variety of data for seismic research, drilling, mechanical maintenance, worldwide logistics, and even gas station retail.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Engineering","Oil & Gas"]},{"id":"9780071836333","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Likeable Social Media, Revised and Expanded: How to Delight Your Customers, Create an Irresistible Brand, and Be Amazing on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn,, 2nd Edition","authors":["Dave Kerpen"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"March 2015","description":"The New York Times and USA Today bestseller—updated to bring you up to speed on the latest social media sites, features, and strategies\n\nFrom one of the world's leading figures in social media marketing, networking, and business applications comes the heavily revised and updated edition of the Likeable Social Media.\n\nDave Kerpen is CEO of Likeable Local and Likeable Media, which has won two WOMMY awards from the Word of Mouth Marketing Association (WOMMA) for excellence in word-of-mouth marketing.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Marketing","Digital Marketing","Social Media Marketing"]},{"id":"9789814463300","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Plasma Harmonics","authors":["Rashid A.

The use of the solid elements of the periodic table, together with thousands of complex solid-state samples, largely extends the range of materials employed in plasma harmonics in contrast to the few light rare gases that are typically used. Thus the exploration of practically any available solid-state material through nonlinear spectroscopy comprising laser ablation and harmonic generation can be considered a new tool for materials science. Plasma harmonic spectroscopy exploits the spectral and structural properties of various ablated solid-state materials by propagating short laser pulses through laser-produced plasma and generating high-order harmonics of ultrashort laser pulses.\n\nThe book describes the special features of plasma harmonics in laser-produced ablation plumes and discusses a wide range of nonlinear medium characteristics that can be produced by varying the conditions of laser plume production on the surface of a solid.\n\nThis book compiles and details cutting-edge research in science and medicine from the interdisciplinary team of the Michigan Nanotechnology Institute for Medicine and Biological Sciences, who are currently revolutionizing drug delivery techniques through the development of engineered nanodevices.

There are four key objectives that we wish to achieve through this book. First, we wish to introduce the underpinnings of a new flow-based measurement and management process that can promote truly unshackled thinking both within the marketing function as well as at its interface with other functional areas. Second, we want to demonstrate how firms can win by learning to conceptualize and discover the linkages between marketing and related non-marketing actions and their ultimate marketplace and financial consequences. Third, we aim to provide guidance for how marketing managers and CMOs can significantly improve the outcomes of their decisions by following a verification-based linkage discovery process to connect marketing actions to profits. And fourth, we wish to provide evidence for the efficacy of verification-based thinking centered on the principles of Decision Equity from successful marketing interventions and implementations in well-known organizations.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Marketing"]},{"id":"9781118239124","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Facebook Marketing: An Hour a Day, 2nd Edition","authors":["Chris Treadaway","Mari Smith"],"pages":"360","publication_date":"May 2012","description":"The bestselling Sybex guide to marketing on Facebook, now fully updated\n\nAs the second most-visited site on the web, Facebook offers myriad marketing opportunities and a host of new tools.

Since 1992, the UNFCCC and its Kyoto Protocol has been the primary legal instrument to respond to the climate challenge. However, the intergovernmental process has been riddled with problems that have rendered it ineffective. The changing economic landscape has further made this country grouping problematic as some developing countries now emit more than some of their advanced counterparts. Such problems have crippled the existing regime in adequately addressing climate change.\n\nBuilding upon the expertise of the contributors of this volume, this ground-breaking collection aims to show the way forward for the intergovernmental process. It is the first of its kind to explore the key features of the regime, featuring meticulously researched pieces from leading experts in the field. Each chapter responds to the questions surrounding the political and structural limitations of the current top-down approach taken in climate negotiations and proposes various alternatives countries can take to overcome such limitations in the process of building the post-2020 climate change regime. In particular, this collection underscores the concept of low-carbon development and green growth to make the climate change regime more effective.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Science","Climate Change"]},{"id":"9780128041963","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Securing Social Media in the Enterprise","authors":["Henry Dalziel"],"pages":"48","publication_date":"August 2015","description":"Securing Social Media in the Enterprise is a concise overview of the security threats posed by the use of social media sites and apps in enterprise network environments.

Each volume seeks to present an analysis of a specific area or sector of the Indian economy. This volume examines various aspects of India’s agricultural sector.\n\nThree of the basic foundations needed for building a sound agricultural economy are a productive technology package, efficient delivery services, and remunerative and stable market prices for produce.
