Starting from the basics, this book helps readers to take the first step towards becoming a properly qualified financial risk manager and asset manager, roles that are currently in huge demand. Accessible to intelligent readers with a moderate understanding of mathematics at high school level or to anyone with a university degree in mathematics, physics or engineering, no prior knowledge of finance is necessary. Instead the emphasis is on understanding ideas rather than on mathematical rigour, meaning that this book offers a fast-track introduction to financial analysis for readers with some quantitative background, highlighting those areas of mathematics that are particularly relevant to solving problems in financial risk management and asset management. Unique to this book is a focus on both continuous and discrete time finance so that Quantitative Methods in Finance is not only about the application of mathematics to finance; it also explains, in very pedagogical terms, how the continuous time and discrete time finance disciplines meet, providing a comprehensive, highly accessible guide which will provide readers with the tools to start applying their knowledge immediately.\n\nAll together, the Market Risk Analysis four volume set illustrates virtually every concept or formula with a practical, numerical example or a longer, empirical case study. Across all four volumes there are approximately 300 numerical and empirical examples, 400 graphs and figures and 30 case studies many of which are contained in interactive Excel spreadsheets available from the accompanying CD-ROM .

This is a must-read for any trader that wants to learn his own path to success.\"\n\n—Noble DraKoln, founder, SpeculatorAcademy.com, and author of Trade Like a Pro and Winning the Trading Game\n\n\"A great trader once told me that success was a function of focused energy. This mantra is proven by Al Brooks, who left a thriving ophthalmology practice to become a day trader. Al's intense focus on daily price action has made him a successful trader. A born educator, Al also is generous with his time, providing detailed explanations on how he views daily price action and how other traders can implement his ideas with similar focus and dedication. Al's book is no quick read, but an in-depth road map on how he trades today's volatile markets, complete with detailed strategies, real-life examples, and hard-knocks advice.\"\n\n—Ginger Szala, Publisher and Editorial Director, Futures magazine\n\nOver the course of his career, author Al Brooks, a technical analysis contributor to Futures magazine and an independent trader for twenty-five years, has found a way to capture consistent profits regardless of market direction or economic climate. And now, with his new three-book series—which focuses on how to use price action to trade the markets—Brooks takes you step by step through the entire process.\n\nIn order to put his methodology in perspective, Brooks examined an essential array of price action basics and trends in the first book of this series, Trading Price Action TRENDS. Now, in this second book, Trading Price Action TRADING RANGES, he provides important insights on trading ranges, breakouts, order management, and the mathematics of trading.\n\nPage by page, Brooks skillfully addresses how to spot and profit from trading ranges—which most markets are in, most of the time—using the technical analysis of price action. Along the way, he touches on some of the most important aspects of this approach, including trading breakouts, understanding support and resistance, and making the most informed entry and exit decisions possible. Throughout the book, Brooks focuses primarily on 5 minute candle charts—all of which are created with TradeStation—to illustrate basic principles, but also discusses daily and weekly charts. And since he trades more than just E-mini S&P 500 futures, Brooks also details how price action can be used as the basis for trading stocks, forex, Treasury Note futures, and options.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Financial Markets","Trading Stocks"]},{"id":"9781119880936","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Financial Valuation, 5th Edition","authors":["James R.

The complexities created by the combination of longs, shorts, and leverage, however, make market-neutral strategies very different from conventional investments.

This book builds on the author Kannan Subramanian’s earlier book, Event- and Data-Centric Enterprise Risk-Adjusted Return Management, delving in depth into enterprise non-interest operating cost management and operating leverage.\n\nOperating Leverage is about managing a bank’s capabilities and its capacity to deliver its products and services efficiently. It is not limited to managing operational costs but includes the operational support for the growth of business and for improving profitability. Profit is an absolute measure that denotes the amount of money the bank makes after deducting all expenses. Profitability measures how efficient the bank is at utilizing its resources to generate risk-adjusted returns. The reader can learn to improve risk adjusted operational effectiveness by implementing a nuanced approach to managing performance, risk, control, and cost simultaneously, at the process level.\n\nYou’ll examine how some institutions have implemented activity-based costing in a siloed environment and without enterprise process automation.  Many institutions do not have a scientific way of managing non-interest costs.

Management, Mintzberg writes, is a practice that blends a great deal of craft (experience) with a certain amount of art (insight) and some science (analysis). Because conventional MBA programs are designed almost exclusively for young people with little if any managerial experience, and hence little art and no craft to draw upon, the programs overemphasize science, in the form of analysis and technique. Graduates leave with a distorted impression that management consists entirely of applying formulas to situations, which has had a corrupting, dehumanizing effect not just on the practice of management, but also on our organizations and our social institutions. Turning to how managers should be developed, Mintzberg describes in detail a set of innovative programs designed to address these shortcomings that he and a group of colleagues have put into practice: the International Masters in Practicing Management (IMPM). Finally, he outlines how business schools can transform themselves to become true schools of management.

Based on fifteen years of further research, Game-Theoretic Foundations for Probability and Finance presents a mature view of the foundational role game theory can play. Its account of probability theory opens the way to new methods of prediction and testing and makes many statistical methods more transparent and widely usable. Its contributions to finance theory include purely game-theoretic accounts of Ito’s stochastic calculus, the capital asset pricing model, the equity premium, and portfolio theory.\n\nGame-Theoretic Foundations for Probability and Finance is a book of research. It is also a teaching resource. Each chapter is supplemented with carefully designed exercises and notes relating the new theory to its historical context.\n\nPraise from early readers\n\n“Ever since Kolmogorov's Grundbegriffe, the standard mathematical treatment of probability theory has been measure-theoretic. In this ground-breaking work, Shafer and Vovk give a game-theoretic foundation instead. While being just as rigorous, the game-theoretic approach allows for vast and useful generalizations of classical measure-theoretic results, while also giving rise to new, radical ideas for prediction, statistics and mathematical finance without stochastic assumptions. The authors set out their theory in great detail, resulting in what is definitely one of the most important books on the foundations of probability to have appeared in the last few decades.” – Peter Grünwald, CWI and University of Leiden\n\n“Shafer and Vovk have thoroughly re-written their 2001 book on the game-theoretic foundations for probability and for finance. They have included an account of the tremendous growth that has occurred since, in the game-theoretic and pathwise approaches to stochastic analysis and in their applications to continuous-time finance.

We arrive at his central investment methodology of Austrian Investing, where victory comes not from waging the immediate decisive battle, but rather from the roundabout approach of seeking the intermediate positional advantage (what he calls shi), of aiming at the indirect means rather than directly at the ends. The monumental challenge is in seeing time differently, in a whole new intertemporal dimension, one that is so contrary to our wiring.\n\nSpitznagel is the first to condense the theories of Ludwig von Mises and his Austrian School of economics into a cohesive and—as Spitznagel has shown—highly effective investment methodology. From identifying the monetary distortions and non-randomness of stock market routs (Spitznagel's bread and butter) to scorned highly-productive assets, in Ron Paul's words from the foreword, Spitznagel \"brings Austrian economics from the ivory tower to the investment portfolio.\"\n\nThe Dao of Capital provides a rare and accessible look through the lens of one of today's great investors to discover a profound harmony with the market process—a harmony that is so essential today.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Financial Markets","Trading Stocks"]},{"id":"9780240817347","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Trade Secrets","authors":["Rowland B.

They poke and prod at other people’s digital creations, expecting them to fail in unexpected ways. Shouldn’t that same skeptical power be turned inward? Shouldn’t practitioners ask: “How do I know that my enterprise security capabilities work? Are they scaling, accelerating, or slowing as the business exposes more value to more people and through more channels at higher velocities?” This is the start of the modern measurement mindset—the mindset that seeks to confront security with data.\n\nThe Metrics Manifesto: Confronting Security with Data delivers an examination of security metrics with R, the popular open-source programming language and software development environment for statistical computing. This insightful and up-to-date guide offers readers a practical focus on applied measurement that can prove or disprove the efficacy of information security measures taken by a firm.\n\nThe book’s detailed chapters combine topics like security, predictive analytics, and R programming to present an authoritative and innovative approach to security metrics. The author and security professional examines historical and modern methods of measurement with a particular emphasis on Bayesian Data Analysis to shed light on measuring security operations.\n\nReaders will learn how processing data with R can help measure security improvements and changes as well as help technology security teams identify and fix gaps in security. The book also includes downloadable code for people who are new to the R programming language.\n\nPerfect for security engineers, risk engineers, IT security managers, CISOs, and data scientists comfortable with a bit of code, The Metrics Manifesto offers readers an invaluable collection of information to help professionals prove the efficacy of security measures within their company.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Financial Markets","Securities"]},{"id":"9780471730972","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Mechanical Trading Systems: Pairing Trader Psychology with Technical Analysis","authors":["Richard L.

As that moment approaches, unusual market forces create option price distortions, rarely understood by most investors. These distortions give rise to outstanding trading opportunities with enormous profit potential. In Trading Options at Expiration: Strategies and Models for Winning the Endgame, leading options trader Jeff Augen explores this extraordinary opportunity with never-before published statistical models, minute-by-minute pricing analysis, and optimized trading strategies that regularly deliver returns of 40%-300% per trade.\n\nYou’ll learn how to structure positions that profit from end-of-contract price distortions with remarkably low risk. These strategies don’t rely on your ability to pick stocks or predict market direction and they only require one or two days of market exposure per month. Augen also discusses:\n\n·         Three powerful end-of-cycle effects not comprehended by contemporary pricing models\n\n·         Trading only one or two days each month and avoiding overnight exposure\n\n·         Leveraging the surprising power of expiration-day pricing dynamics\n\nIf you’re looking for an innovative new way to reignite your returns no matter where the markets move, you’ve found it in Trading Options at Expiration.\n\n “Learn and profit from Jeff Augen’s book: It clearly explains how to take advantage of market inefficiencies in collapsing implied volatility, effects of strike price, and time decay. A must-read for individuals who are options oriented.”\n\n--Ralph J. Acampora, CMT, Director of Technical Analysis Studies, New York Institute of Finance\n\n“A fantastic, insightful book full of meticulously compiled statistics about anomalies that surround option expiration. Not only does Augen present a set of effective trading strategies to capitalize on these anomalies, he walks through the performance of each across several expirations. His advice is practical and readily applicable: He outlines common pitfalls, gives guidance on timing your executions, and even includes code that can be used to perform the same calculations he does in the text. A thoroughly enjoyable read that will give you a true edge in your option trading.”\n\n--Alexis Goldstein, Vice President, Equity Derivatives Business Analyst\n\n“Mr. Augen makes a careful and systematic study of option prices at expiration. His translation of price behavior into trading strategy is intriguing work, and the level of detail is impressive.”\n\n--Dr. Robert Jennings, Professor of Finance, Indiana University Kelly School of Business\n\n“This book fills a gap in the vast amount of literature on derivatives trading and stands out for being extremely well written, clear, concise, and very low on jargon--perfect for traders looking to evolve their equity option strategies.”\n\n--Nazzaro Angelini, Principal, Spearpoint Capital\n\n“Instead of considering macro-time strategies that take weeks to unfold, Jeff Augen is thinking micro here--hours or days--specifically the days or hours right before expiration, and harnessing grinding, remorseless options decay for profit. He builds a compelling case for the strategy here. The concept of using ratio spreads plus risk management for as brief a period as one day--open to close--to capture expiring premium is worth the price of admission alone. A superb follow-up to his first book. Must-read for the serious options student.”\n\n--John A.

First, the probabilistic machinery is simpler, and one can discuss right away some of the key problems in the theory of pricing and hedging of financial derivatives. Second, the paradigm of a complete financial market, where all derivatives admit a perfect hedge, becomes the exception rather than the rule. Thus, the need to confront the intrinsic risks arising from market incomleteness appears at a very early stage.The first part of the book contains a study of a simple one-period model, which also serves as a building block for later developments. Topics include the characterization of arbitrage-free markets, preferences on asset profiles, an introduction to equilibrium analysis, and monetary measures of financial risk.In the second part, the idea of dynamic hedging of contingent claims is developed in a multiperiod framework. Topics include martingale measures, pricing formulas for derivatives, American options, superhedging, and hedging strategies with minimal shortfall risk.This fourth, newly revised edition contains more than one hundred exercises. It also includes material on risk measures and the related issue of model uncertainty, in particular a chapter on dynamic risk measures and sections on robust utility maximization and on efficient hedging with convex risk measures.\n\nContents:Part I: Mathematical finance in one periodArbitrage theoryPreferencesOptimality and equilibriumMonetary measures of riskPart II: Dynamic hedgingDynamic arbitrage theoryAmerican contingent claimsSuperhedgingEfficient hedgingHedging under constraintsMinimizing the hedging errorDynamic risk measures","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance"]},{"id":"9781119167914","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Listed Volatility and Variance Derivatives","authors":["Yves Hilpisch"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"December 2016","description":"Leverage Python for expert-level volatility and variance derivative trading\n\nListed Volatility and Variance Derivatives is a comprehensive treatment of all aspects of these increasingly popular derivatives products, and has the distinction of being both the first to cover European volatility and variance products provided by Eurex and the first to offer Python code for implementing comprehensive quantitative analyses of these financial products.

There are a small number of modern-day pioneers among us who must be sought out. Scott Carney is one of those pioneers who has devoted himself to the task of uncovering the hidden logic in the movements of the markets. Harmonic Trading: Volume 1 provides a system of critical decision-making based on the natural order of life, which allows investors to replace emotions and guesswork with logic and symmetry so necessary to becoming a successful investor.”\n\n--PAUL DESMOND, President of Lowry Research Corporation\n\n“I am well aware of the author’s dedication and degree of excellence in his work.

I currently oversee the management of more than $3 billion in assets using a technical model. I know firsthand that a trading methodology that does not have buy, sell, and trade-up rules will never be successful. Every effort needs to be made to make the process free of subjectivity. Harmonic Trading will help you organize your trading and keep you in sync with the markets.

Large and regulated organizations are forced to demonstrate due diligence in vendor assessment, but often do not know how to do this. This results in a great deal of busywork being required by both the vendors and the organizations. Smaller organizations don't know what to look for and, as a result, often wind up selecting based on price instead of value. This results in service failures and vendors that just milk their customers for as long as they can.\n\nAssessing Vendors shows you how to walk the line between under- and over-assessing, so decisions can be made on sufficient data without wasting time, digging too deeply, or making decisions too quickly. This hands-on guide will show you how to use an iterative approach to vendor analysis, so you can rapidly filter out the vendors that are clear failures and then select likely winners. It will then show you how to do progressively deeper dives into the likely winners so you can select a preferred vendor. Finally, you will learn how to negotiate with your preferred vendor to get reasonable prices and services.\n\nProvides an iterative approach to vendor assessment, showing you how to make decisions on sufficient data without wasting time\nIncludes checklists to help you navigate the decision-making process, while considering all the important factors needed to make a sound decision\nHelps you understand and evaluate vendors based on key concepts such as performance criteria, functional testing, production, and price\nProvides an iterative approach to vendor assessment, showing you how to make decisions on sufficient data without wasting time\nIncludes checklists to help you navigate the decision-making process, while considering all the important factors needed to make a sound decision\nHelps you understand and evaluate vendors based on key concepts such as performance criteria, functional testing, production, and price","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Corporate Valuation"]},{"id":"9781264277575","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Divestitures: Creating Value Through Strategy, Structure, and Implementation","authors":["Emilie R.

Using FPGAs, a system designer working on a PC can now develop a working prototype in a few hours and change it at will in just a few minutes, rather than waiting weeks or months for a printed-circuit assembly or a custom integrated circuit to be built. This newfound ability to change a system by simply altering its configuration memory is also leading to exciting new forms of computing, such as array applications that exploit parallelism.

Do it right, and no one notices. Do it wrong, and your film or video sounds messy, distracting, and unrealistic. This is a book for people who need to edit production sound for film, TV, or video but were never taught how to do it. It goes step by step through the process and covers all the workflows you are likely to encounter. Efficient working practices are emphasized throughout, so you learn to save time and avoid needless repetition.\n\nMany dialogue editors are hobbled by a lack of understanding of the non-sound aspects of filmmaking. Unlike editors who cut effects, backgrounds or Foley, a dialogue editor's work is directly affected by what has gone on before. How a film was shot, recorded and edited will dramatically influence the dialogue editing process. Much of this book, then, deals with things which at first glance don't appear to be dialogue. You will find overviews of film picture and sound postproduction--film, tape, NTSC, PAL, 24p, and HD.

It is the glue by which all the departments are bound and the aggregated success or failure of each trade determines the survival and growth of the entire organization. Trading has evolved from a humble apple grower wanting a stable price for his produce come harvest time, to a complex and exciting industry comprising a significant share of the global economy, and more recently, taking a hand in saving it. It is the fundamental activity of investment banks, hedge funds, pension funds and many other financial companies. There is no better way to understanding the workings of a financial institution than to follow the progress of a trade through all of its various stages and all the activities performed upon it.\n\nIn the aftermath of the financial crisis, the financial world has changed, with less emphasis on trading and entrepreneurial activity and more on risk management, regulation and auditing. In this new world order, there will be a much greater analysis of every trade, and all market participants will need to have a much better understanding of the impact of their work on the whole trade cycle.\n\nThis book will dissect a trade into its component parts, track it from pre-conception to maturity and how the trade effects each business function of a financial institution. As well as illustrating each part of the trade process, it will highlight the legal, operational, liquidity, credit and market risks to which the trade is exposed.

Webb"],"pages":"368","publication_date":"October 2006","description":"In Trading Catalysts, Robert I. Webb examines the various factors that move markets. Webb focuses on the catalysts that spark the biggest price changes–and the greatest potential for substantial profits or losses. Using numerous real market examples, Webb demonstrates the often inconsistent response of prices to similar trading catalysts across markets and over time, the occasional significantly delayed response, and the frequent market overreaction. Whether traders bet directly on a trading catalyst, on the presumed market reaction (or overreaction) to it, or not at all, the potential impact on market prices and volatility means that all traders must pay attention to trading catalysts and the market reactions that they induce. At the very least, the prospect of significant volatility around some event may affect the timing of a trader’s entry or exit of positions and may cause a trader to reduce his position size. If you’re a serious trader, this book will help you understand the influence of trading catalysts and identify potential trading opportunities.\n\nVolatile financial markets create both the risk of substantial losses and the opportunity for substantial gains. Sudden jumps or breaks in prices can impart a roller-coaster-ride-like quality to trading or investing in financial markets. Trading Catalysts is the first complete guide to the events that spark large changes in prices. These include: central bank actions; ill-advised comments by policymakers; news of natural disasters; elections; certain economic reports; terrorism; company specific announcements; the unwinding of large positions by key market participants; and simple trading errors among others. The varied origin of trading catalysts means that some traders may have an edge in anticipating the market’s reaction to certain trading catalysts. Numerous real market examples take the reader into the heart of the market to illustrate the direction, magnitude, speed, duration, intensity and breadthof influence of trading catalysts on market prices. Because a minute can be a “lifetime” in the world of trading, many of the detailed examples recount moment-by-moment and tick-by-tick changes in market prices. This book discusses the role that trading theses(or prevailing beliefs about market relationships), market conditions,and sentimentplay in determining how prices react and sometimes overreact to various trading catalysts over time. Trading Catalysts will help readers anticipate potential events that could spark rallies or breaks; predict situations with feedback loops that drive markets up or down; and identify situations where substantial overreactions are likely to occur.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Financial Markets","Trading Stocks"]},{"id":"9780470481790","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Corporate Valuation Modeling: A Step-by-Step Guide","authors":["KEITH A.

With experience and insights from both the film industry and the corporate world, they understand the pitch process.\n\nIn Pitch Like Hollywood, they show you how to up your game substantially—no matter what business you’re in—by incorporating elements of a classic Hollywood pitch: driving emotion, piquing curiosity, and ultimately winning over decision makers with powerful persuasion and performance.

Badré says that finance is inherently neither good nor bad. It's just a tool—the most powerful tool on earth. Used correctly, it can be at the heart of the way we address many of the world's biggest problems, ranging from climate change to the eradication of poverty to building much-needed infrastructure. He describes innovations in financial tools and approaches that are already happening around the world and looks at the role regulation can play in channeling the power of finance in a positive direction. He details options for strengthening international cooperation for financial stability and prosperity and overcoming the blinkered nationalism currently on the rise. And he tells what is working and what needs to change in financing the sustainable development of the world. This book is rich with practical examples, some developed by Badré himself. For instance, he describes how at the World Bank he devised an innovative way to use insurance, a financial tool rarely considered in international development, to buttress fragile emerging economies against natural disasters and pandemics. Initiatives like these show that, as Badré writes, “when controlled and used intelligently, with benevolence and inventiveness, finance can accomplish great things.”","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance"]},{"id":"9781292309095","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"The Financial Times Guide to Business Coaching, 2nd Edition","authors":["Anne Scoular"],"pages":"249","publication_date":"August 2020","description":"Anne Scoular began her career as a diplomat, before becoming an international banker and then retraining as an organisational psychologist and business coach.

The authors are the developers of the European Central Bank's (ECB) standard for the description of financial instruments. The ECB has adopted this approach because it is an extremely flexible, innovative, yet logically simple and consistent way to accurately define and set up even very large numbers of financial instruments, and because it simplifies the valuation, risk and performance measurement process. This is because it standardizes and breaks up the calculation task into simpler subtasks, thus preparing the way for a faster road to improvements in speed and accuracy.This is the only book that explains the new ECB standard, and provides clear and consistent worked examples and programming code throughout the book to demonstrate to the reader how to use the standard to build financial instruments in software systems, then how to price them, and then how to measure the risk and performance of the portfolios that comprise them.The aim of this book is to introduce the reader to a practical approach for pricing a broad range of financial instruments and analysing the risk and performance of simple and complex portfolios. Carefully chosen worked examples will allow the reader to gain confidence in using securities and derivatives pricing models and risk and performance measurement methods commonly used in today's risk and portfolio management practice. Its practical focus, systematic step by step approach and fully up to date coverage of pricing, risk and performance measurement analytics will set this book apart from competing publications and fill a growing need for a practical introduction to financial engineering and risk and performance measurement. The key value proposition for this book is that it is based on the authors? experience of designing and implementing valuation, risk measurement, and performance measurement solutions, and in particular developing and implementing the European Central Bank's (ECB) standard for the description of financial instruments. The book will thus help the reader bridge the gap from understanding pricing, risk and performance measurement models to their practical implementation in software based solutions.The book introduces the reader to an approach developed by the authors while working for the European Central Bank. It allows to price and analyse any instrument in terms of a limited set of atomic instruments. The pricing and risk relevant characteristics of any financial instrument can thus be decomposed into those of a small set of atomic instruments that represent the given instrument well. The instrument can then be priced and performance and risk analytics for it can be calculated using well known robust models utilizing readily available information. This approach allows the reader to overcome the situation of having to master a myriad of specific instrument variants and their pricing and risk measurement models, by being able to make reference to a single framework.This approach was selected first because it is an extremely flexible, innovative and yet logically simple and consistent way to accurately define and set up even very large numbers of financial instruments of every description from simple to complex and from traditional to one-off and just invented, and second because it simplifies the valuation, risk and performance measurement calculation process. This is because it standardizes and breaks up the calculation task into simpler subtasks thus preparing the way for a faster road to improvements in speed and accuracy. The book then builds on this with further guidance, telling the reader what is relevant and what not, and showing how to structure a variety of implementation problems to be successful in the career-threatening task of getting a risk and performance measurement system up and running.Starting with an in-depth examination of how to price instruments, the book will build up a practical framework for the analysis of the market and credit risk exposure of financial instruments and portfolios as well as the calculation of risk adjusted performance measures relevant for the business of investment funds / trust managers and financial institutions. Building on this practical approach to pricing the book will then survey different approaches to risk measurement and show the reader how to implement a simulation based approach to measuring instrument and portfolio based Value at Risk (VAR) and Expected Tail Risk (ETL).Finally the book will survey different approaches to measuring the risk adjusted performance of investment portfolios (financial institutions) and show how these measurements may be implemented in the context of the book's logical framework.Feature: The authors have designed and implemented the European Central Bank's standard for the description of financial instrumentsBenefit: The reader can rely on accurate and valid information about describing financial instrumentsFeature: The authors have developed an approach for pricing and analyzing any financial instrument using a limited set of atomic instrumentsBenefit: The reader can use these instruments, validated through the ECB, to define and set up even very large numbers of financial instruments.Feature: The book builds a practical framework for analysing the market and credit risk exposure of financial instruments and portfoliosBenefit: Readers can use this framework today in their work and identify and measure market and credit risk using a reliable method validated by the ECB","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Corporate Valuation"]},{"id":"9781119953388","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Marketing and Finance: Creating Shareholder Value","authors":["Malcolm McDonald","Brian Smith","Keith Ward"],"pages":"280","publication_date":"September 2013","description":"Written for marketing and finance directors, CEOs, and strategists, as well as MBA students, this practical book explains the principles and practice behind rigorous due diligence in marketing.

Corcoran"],"pages":"364","publication_date":"January 2013","description":"The dramatic and well chronicled crisis of 2007/8 marked a watershed moment for all stakeholders in global capital markets. In the aftermath, financial markets have become even more tightly coupled as correlations in returns across multiple asset classes have been at historically elevated levels. Investors and fund managers are, to a much larger degree than previously and often much more than they realize, subject to the risk of severe wealth destruction. The ultimate hazard, which is not adequately characterized by the widely touted notion of tail risk, is the systemic risk which arises when liquidity in markets completely evaporates. Not only did this happen in the second half of 2008, but it has been repeated episodically since then – most notably in May 2010, in an incident known as the Flash Crash, and in the fall of 2011 when correlations were at historically elevated levels.\n\nConventional asset allocation tools and techniques have failed to keep apace with the changing financial landscape which has emerged since 2008. In addition to the preponderance of algorithmic trading and the associated changes in the liquidity characteristics of financial markets, a new paradigm of risk on/risk off asset allocation has emerged. Risk on/risk off is a widely adopted style of trading and macro allocation strategy where positions are taken in several closely aligned asset classes depending on the prevailing sentiment or appetite for risk. The consequences of the day to day (and intraday) switching between either a risk on or risk off tactical strategies poses significant new challenges to investors who are still making investment decisions with outmoded notions from traditional asset allocation theory.\n\nHow can one cushion the impact of systemically threatening events when the ability to exit financial instruments becomes almost non existent? How can one trust the integrity of financial models and orthodox macro financial theory which have become increasingly discredited? Can central bankers be relied upon to become the counter-parties of last resort and provide a safety net under the financial system? These vital questions, and many others, need to be addressed by everyone who has a stake in modern financial markets, and they are addressed in Systemic Liquidity Risk and Bipolar Markets.\n\nProper functioning markets require fractiousness or divided opinion, and this needs to be lubricated by communications from central bankers, economic forecasters, corporate executives and so on. As long as such messages and market conditions remain ambiguous, providing asymmetric information to different market players, then the conditions are present to enable systemic liquidity to be preserved. Seen in this context the prevailing paradigm of bipolar risk on/risk off asset allocations is both a prerequisite to liquid markets, and also paradoxically, when one side of the polarity becomes too extreme, a major source of systemic instability. Should such polarities become critically unbalanced, and should the signals received by market players become symmetrically disadvantageous as they were in the fall of 2008, then an even more substantial systemic liquidity crisis than that seen in those troubled times is a dangerous possibility.\n\nApart from the practical risk management tools and tactics that are recommended in Systemic Liquidity Risk and Bipolar Markets, there is a provocative and cogent narrative to provide anxious and perplexed investors with a coherent explanation of the post GFC financial environment, and which should assist them in navigating the choppy waters ahead.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Financial Markets"]},{"id":"9780415091411","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Media Effects and Beyond","authors":["Karl Erik Rosengren"],"pages":"336","publication_date":"September 2005","description":"Addressing a multitude of questions and issues surrounding how we use the media, Media Effects and Beyond represents the results of an international research programme into the use and effects of television, video and music.

Rachev"],"pages":"280","publication_date":"January 2009","description":"In the last decade rating-based models have become very popular in credit risk management. These systems use the rating of a company as the decisive variable to evaluate the default risk of a bond or loan. The popularity is due to the straightforwardness of the approach, and to the upcoming new capital accord (Basel II), which allows banks to base their capital requirements on internal as well as external rating systems. Because of this, sophisticated credit risk models are being developed or demanded by banks to assess the risk of their credit portfolio better by recognizing the different underlying sources of risk. As a consequence, not only default probabilities for certain rating categories but also the probabilities of moving from one rating state to another are important issues in such models for risk management and pricing. It is widely accepted that rating migrations and default probabilities show significant variations through time due to macroeconomics conditions or the business cycle. These changes in migration behavior may have a substantial impact on the value-at-risk (VAR) of a credit portfolio or the prices of credit derivatives such as collateralized debt obligations (D+CDOs). In this book the authors develop a much more sophisticated analysis of migration behavior. Their contribution of more sophisticated techniques to measure and forecast changes in migration behavior as well as determining adequate estimators for transition matrices is a major contribution to rating based credit modeling.*Internal ratings-based systems are widely used in banks to calculate their value-at-risk (VAR) in order to determine their capital requirements for loan and bond portfolios under Basel II*One aspect of these ratings systems is credit migrations, addressed in a systematic and comprehensive way for the first time in this book*The book is based on in-depth work by Trueck and Rachev,","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Corporate Valuation"]},{"id":"9781491957509","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Creating Web Animations","authors":["Kirupa Chinnathambi"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"March 2017","description":"Creating user interfaces that are fun, practical, fluid, and memorable is hard.

By exploring the heart of the shadow economy, you'll be better prepared to ride the rough waves of finance into the turbulent future.\n\nDelve into one of the world's least-understood but highest-impact industries\nUnderstand the key principles of quantitative finance and the evolution of the field\nLearn what quantitative finance has become, and how it affects us all\nDiscover how the industry's next steps dictate the economy's future\n\nHow do you create a quadrillion dollars out of nothing, blow it away and leave a hole so large that even years of \"quantitative easing\" can't fill it – and then go back to doing the same thing? Even amidst global recovery, the financial system still has the potential to seize up at any moment. The Money Formula explores the how and why of financial disaster, what must happen to prevent the next one.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance"]},{"id":"9781398618497","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"How the Stock Market Works, 8th Edition","authors":["Michael Becket"],"pages":"208","publication_date":"April 2025","description":"Learn how the UK's investment and financial markets work and take control of your finances with this clear and practical guide to understanding investing.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Financial Markets"]},{"id":"9780240808826","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Directing, 4th Edition","authors":["Michael Rabiger"],"pages":"548","publication_date":"June 2014","description":"Directing: Film Techniques and Aesthetics is a comprehensive manual that has inspired tens of thousands of readers worldwide to realize their artistic vision and produce well-constructed films.

Writing for beginners and experienced investors alike, successful trader and author Jeff Augen illuminates key issues that are often mentioned but rarely fully understood: issues such as leverage, liquidity, market trends, risk, valuation, interest rates, and the impact of news and events. Most important, he shows how to apply this knowledge to trade and invest far more profitably. Augen focuses on the massive forces that really move financial markets: the market dynamics that are fundamental to your success, regardless of your investment strategies or the asset classes you choose. You'll learn how to value markets in absolute terms (e.g. constant currency), rank investment vehicles according to risk; assess the real impact of leverage and the true meaning of trends; interpret the flow of money between markets; and much more. Augen shows how to identify and collect the information that matters most (and ignore the information that doesn't matter). Once you have the facts you need, you'll learn how to use those facts to gain a clear advantage: one that you can sustain through any market environment.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Financial Markets","Trading Stocks"]},{"id":"9781118111970","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Corporate Finance Workbook: A Practical Approach, Second Edition","authors":["CFA Michelle R.

Since his release from federal prison, in 1998, Mitnick has turned his life around and established himself as one of the most sought-after computer security experts worldwide. Now, in The Art of Deception, the world's most notorious hacker gives new meaning to the old adage, \"It takes a thief to catch a thief.\"\n\nFocusing on the human factors involved with information security, Mitnick explains why all the firewalls and encryption protocols in the world will never be enough to stop a savvy grifter intent on rifling a corporate database or an irate employee determined to crash a system. With the help of many fascinating true stories of successful attacks on business and government, he illustrates just how susceptible even the most locked-down information systems are to a slick con artist impersonating an IRS agent. Narrating from the points of view of both the attacker and the victims, he explains why each attack was so successful and how it could have been prevented in an engaging and highly readable style reminiscent of a true-crime novel. And, perhaps most importantly, Mitnick offers advice for preventing these types of social engineering hacks through security protocols, training programs, and manuals that address the human element of security.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","FinTech"]},{"id":"9780240803555","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Vale's Technique of Screen and Television Writing","authors":["Eugene Vale"],"pages":"232","publication_date":"January 2013","description":"Vale's Technique of Screen and Television Writing is an updated and expanded edition of a valuable guide to writing for film and television.

Step-by-step, they address the projection of financial statements, calculating free cash flows, risk-adjusted cost of capital, and several leading methodologies, including WACC, flow-to-equity, and APV. Throughout, each concept is explained with realistic examples, and demonstrated with accessible math. No previous mathematical understanding is required beyond basic algebra, probability, and statistics: wherever more advanced math is required, the authors explain it fully. Next, in Valuation for Mergers and Acquisitions, Second Edition, Barbara S. Petitt and Kenneth R. Ferris present a complete, practitioner-oriented view of valuation in the context of M&A and corporate restructurings. Petitt and Ferris guide you through performing a target's financial review, developing forecasts, and assessing the sensitivity of these forecasts to key assumptions. You'll review both traditional and alternative valuation methods, from the basic P/E ratio to a wide range of discounted cash flow models, economic value analysis, and real option analyses. The authors also address closely-related issues such as accounting, financial reporting, and tax considerations. Throughout, you'll find realistic advice for making more informed choices, handling common dilemmas, and overcoming common errors -- all illuminated with real-world examples and illustrations. Whatever your role in establishing valuations or making corporate investment decisions, this collection will help you reduce your risks and improve your performance.\n\nFrom world-renowned valuation expertsGeorge Chacko, Carolyn L.

Mandis uncovers the forces behind what he calls Goldman’s organizational drift.” Drawing from his firsthand experience; sociological research; analysis of SEC, congressional, and other filings; and a wide array of interviews with former clients, detractors, and current and former partners, Mandis uncovers the pressures that forced Goldman to slowly drift away from the very principles on which its reputation was built.Mandis evaluates what made Goldman Sachs so successful in the first place, how it responded to pressures to grow, why it moved away from the values and partnership culture that sustained it for so many years, what forces accelerated this drift, and why insiders can’tor won’trecognize this crucial change.Combining insightful analysis with engaging storytelling, Mandis has written an insider’s history that offers invaluable perspectives to business leaders interested in understanding and managing organizational drift in their own firms.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Banking"]},{"id":"9780132447294","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"The Secrets of Economic Indicators: Hidden Clues to Future Economic Trends and Investment Opportunities, Second Edition","authors":["Bernard Baumohl"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"July 2007","description":"“This is the real deal.

The video-taperecorder was an addition to the technology of mass communications, a handy gadget for recording synchronized images and sound on magnetic tapes for storage or simultaneous playback. But the authors of this study look at it as also mirror, relay and catalyst, offering creative possibilities of exploration and criticism, of active analysis and transformation, of self-discovery and communication. They discern a liberating potential of video an antidote to the dominance of centralized TV in consumer society and ultimately a means towards the progressive social reappropriation of the media of communication.\n\nThe authors draw on their experience working with school-children, teenagers, and a variety of cultural, political and community groups to illustrate the versatility of video in approaching diverse situations of everyday life, whether from the viewpoint of ‘cultural animation’, sociological research, or a surrealistic game. These projects, and interviews with other practitioners, present here the basis for a first typology of styles and approaches in using video, and for a ‘videology’: a language, a set of concepts, and a theory comprehending process and praxis, image and action. This is a fascinating snapshot now, looking back at these early ideas.","tags":["Design","Visual Design","Film & Video","Video Production"]},{"id":"9780429807596","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Screens Producing & Media Operations","authors":["Laura Frank"],"pages":"258","publication_date":"October 2019","description":"Media servers have established themselves as the dominant video playback tool for live events; however, the practice of delivering content to these systems and the structure of the media operations team is still evolving.

Riding high on the wave of new financial opportunities are Alternative Alternatives (AA). However, there is a dearth of information on what Alternative Alternatives are, how they work, and how they can be profited from.\n\nThe book defines what Alternative Alternatives are, based on research and the following hypothesis: If the source (origin) of the risk lies outside of the financial markets, then it should be insulated from the vagaries of those markets. The book identifies and examines such and other unique, idiosyncratic, and difficult to replicate sources of risk - assets and strategies. The recent credit and sovereign debt crisis have served to defend the hypothesis and have upheld the conclusion that alternative alternative assets and strategies offer a risk-return profile that is distinct to those offered by traditional and main stream hedge fund strategies. These strategies include timberland investing, insurance risk transfer, asset/loan based lending (aviation, shipping, trade, entertainment, litigation financing etc), collectables and extraction strategies such as volatility and behaviour finance.\n\nThis book will be a one stop resource to the new investment class known globally as Alternative Alternatives (AA) and will provide a comprehensive but accessible introduction to these assets. It provides an in-depth analysis of the assets and strategies which will leave investors with everything they need to identify and allocate to the best AA for them. It reviews the asset on a standalone basis, providing an explanation of the product, its characteristics, a SWOT analysis, and details its risk/reward drivers. The book also looks at how to integrate the asset within a portfolio - its peculiarities, the challenges and the constraints of each. Next, the book shows how Alternative Alternatives are used in the real world, how they are implemented, and the results that they have achieved. Finally, the book looks at the scope, scalability and prospects for each asset in the future.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Financial Markets","Securities"]},{"id":"9781118003831","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Credit Risk Frontiers: Subprime Crisis, Pricing and Hedging, CVA, MBS, Ratings, and Liquidity","authors":["Tomasz R.

It is a dynamical system whose evolution looks like a bell curve with fat “tails.” The same is true of financial markets. However, every day we rely on the certainty and precision of mathematical strategies that assume the contrary to control and grow wealth in markets.\n\nTail Risk Killers shows you how the rigidity of model-based thinking has led to the fragility of today’s global financial marketplace, and it explains how to use adaptive trading strategies to mitigate risk in impending market conditions.\n\nRisk management veteran Jeff McGinn pokes holes in prevalent assumptions about how financial markets act that tend to underestimate the likelihood of occurrence of extreme events. Through clear, conversational writing, real-world anecdotes, and easy-tofollow formulas, he provides a glimpse into the way tomorrow’s successful traders are viewing financial markets—with an eye for probability distributions. While illustrating how to protect your assets from tail risk, he shows you how to:\n\nImplement the six axioms for risk management\nPrepare for the unintended consequences of central banks suppressing tail risk\nIdentify and avoid the dark risks hidden in today’s derivative-laden financial system\nAnticipate the fate of credit default swaps that may not face extinction\n\nMcGinn argues that the intervention of central banks has robbed global markets of their opportunities to adapt, but this highly relevant book shows you that it is not too late to adapt your portfolio to survive the extreme events that happen more often than popular financial models suggest.\n\nTail Risk Killers helps you discover useful information and processes beyond the focus of industry standards, helps you connect the dots of evolving trading strategies and time your next trade for maximum profitability.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Financial Markets","Trading Stocks"]},{"id":"9780240516714","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Guide to Computer Animation","authors":["Marcia Kuperberg"],"pages":"264","publication_date":"November 2012","description":"Any questions you have about 2D or 3D animation in this new digital age are answered in this comprehensive guide for all budding digital animators, games artists and media production students.

Field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are introduced as a technology that provides flexible, fine-grained hardware that can readily exploit parallelism within many image processing algorithms. A brief review of FPGA programming languages provides the link between a software mindset normally associated with image processing algorithms, and the hardware mindset required for efficient utilization of a parallel hardware design. The design process for implementing an image processing algorithm on an FPGA is compared with that for a conventional software implementation, with the key differences highlighted. Particular attention is given to the techniques for mapping an algorithm onto an FPGA implementation, considering timing, memory bandwidth and resource constraints, and efficient hardware computational techniques. Extensive coverage is given of a range of low and intermediate level image processing operations, discussing efficient implementations and how these may vary according to the application.

It is also used as a risk-management tool and a source of liquidity. Securitization has been adapted to fund corporate acquisitions, to capitalize future streams of revenue, and to liquidate pools of nonperforming loans.\n\nWith examples from companies such as GE Capital, Ford Motor Credit, Countrywide Home Loans, and D&K Healthcare, The Securitization Markets Handbook provides descriptions of all major classes of asset-backed securities and offers a practice-oriented commentary on trends in securitization and the value of asset- and mortgage-backed securities across industries and throughout the global markets.\n\nThe authors approach the topic from both sides of the market: the supply side, where assets are securitized and mortgage- and asset-backed securities are issued, and the demand side, where investors choose which classes of mortgage and asset-backed securities will enhance their portfolios or serve as efficient hedges.

Rappaport and Mauboussin provide everything the reader needs to utilize the discounted cash flow model successfully. And they add an important twist: they suggest that rather than forecasting cash flows, investors should begin by estimating the expectations embedded in a company's stock price. An investor who has a fix on the market's expectations can then assess the likelihood of expectations revisions. To help investors anticipate such revisions, Rappaport and Mauboussin introduce an \"expectations infrastructure\" framework for tracing the process of value creation from the basic economic forces that shape a company's performance to the resulting impact on sales, costs, and investment. Investors who use Expectations Investing will have a fundamentally new way to evaluate all stocks, setting them on the path to success.

Following this approach, it is organized into four parts detailing the individual level (founders’ resources, bricolage and bootstrapping, effectuation and portfolio entrepreneurship); the inner circle (informal financing, business groups, incubators and accelerators); the wider world (formal debt, microfinance, venture capital, corporate venture capital, business angels, government funding and family offices); and emerging perspectives (non-Western perspectives, gender, indigenous perspectives, post-conflict and disaster zones and ethics).\n\nThe introduction considers the general state of the field, while the conclusion takes on additional topics relevant to entrepreneurial finance, such as decentralized finance, big data, behavioral economics, financial innovation and COVID-19, as well as possible ways in which entrepreneurial finance can have a greater impact on other disciplines.\n\nThis handbook will be a core reference work for researchers, practitioners, and policy makers seeking an up-to-date academic survey of entrepreneurial finance.

To extend their capabilities and facilitate change, many organizations have experimented with different types of strategic partnerships with suppliers and customers that help them design and deliver products and services efficiently. But some innovative companies are attempting to redefine the parameters of strategic partnerships through multileveled relationships with customers and suppliers that leverage the resources and capabilities of the respective parties. What makes such partnerships — which the author calls adaptive strategic partnerships — counterintuitive is that they are being used in situations where the two most relevant streams of organizational economics would argue for vertical integration. One company that has pursued adaptive strategic partnerships is Bharti Airtel Ltd., the Indian telecommunications services company. Back in 2004, Bharti Airtel’s managers found that negotiating and updating contracts with vendors interfered with their ability to focus on satisfying the company’s customers and outsmarting its competition. Contrary to what other telecom operators have done, it negotiated unconventional relationships with some of its leading vendors, including Nokia Siemens Networks (now Nokia Solutions and Networks), Ericsson and IBM. Instead of expanding network infrastructure by purchasing increasing amounts of equipment (such as exchanges and cellular antennas), which often results in unused capacity, Bharti Airtel pays the vendors to operate the network; it compensates them based on telecom volume, paying only when equipment is in use. In addition to rethinking its approach to network capacity, vendors take responsibility for network performance and troubleshooting. Typically, companies with outside partners rely on simple tools such as service-level agreements, which specify what is expected from each party and provide for performance standards to assess compliance. But in managing its partnerships with vendors, Bharti Airtel uses a joint governing structure that encourages people at different levels of the organizations to communicate and address problems as they arise (for example, restoring service after a severe storm). In some cases, such interactions have led the company and its partners to redraw the scope of their collaborations (for example, assign responsibility for building and maintaining the cell towers to a new company), something that would be more difficult to do in a more traditional partnership. With flexible contracts, the companies can adapt to shifts in competitive environment and implementation challenges. The incentive system rewards vendors for efficient network management. By sharing information with its telecom equipment providers, Bharti Airtel and its partners are incentivized to develop processes that advance learning, innovation and mutual trust. Like Bharti Airtel, other companies are shifting the institutional framework on three dimensions: (1) incentives, (2) information, and (3) collaboration mechanisms. By managing across these dimensions, they are paving the way for the new level of collaboration.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Corporate Valuation"]},{"id":"9780240825175","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Video Shooter, 3rd Edition","authors":["Barry Braverman"],"pages":"330","publication_date":"October 2013","description":"Tired of the all the digital filmmaking guidebooks that give you only the nuts and bolts of how to use a camera?

With insightful qualitative and quantitative analysis, it looks at the phenomenon of equity and capital exchanged between the world's two largest economies and the implications for global finance. Written in an accessible narrative style and amply supported by hard data, the book examines the context and underpinnings of the Sino-American equity relationship, revealing its core dynamics through real-world case studies that range from the precedent-setting blockbuster IPO of China Mobile to the near breakdown of the U.S.-China equity exchange mechanism brought about by short seller attacks on Chinese concept stocks.\n\nCombining an insider's eye with an outsider's objectivity, American born author and Beijing-based consultant Robert Koepp explores the reasons and the means by which China, America, and the global economy reap enormous gains from the process of Chinese companies issuing equity shares on U.S. stock markets. Betting on China exposes the complexities and nuances of a vital but underappreciated pillar of modern international finance and offers a window into China's role as a dominant but still modernizing economic superpower.\n\nAnalyzes on a macro- and microscale the forces that move Chinese companies to raise capital on NASDAQ and the New York Stock Exchange and what this means for the world at large\n\nExplores the real stories behind why and how China-based enterprises develop as public companies listed in the United States—and why government regulations need to work in support of and not against this force of market nature\n\nShows that the \"betting\" on China that occurs through the U.S. equity market exchanges is critical for getting an accurate picture of China's position and prospects in our interactively connected global economy\n\nDetailed but accessible, Betting on China is essential reading for global finance professionals, policymakers and regulators, students of finance, people doing business in China, and anyone curious about China's place in—and impact on—the global economy today and in the years to come.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Financial Markets"]},{"id":"9780240810072","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Final Cut Studio On the Spot, 3rd Edition","authors":["Richard Harrington","Abba Shapiro","Robbie Carman"],"pages":"344","publication_date":"December 2012","description":"Packed with more than 500 techniques, this book delivers what you need to know-on the spot.

Macey"],"pages":"304","publication_date":"March 2013","description":"Why did the financial scandals really happen? Why are they continuing to happen? In The Death of Corporate Reputation, Yale's Jonathan Macey reveals the real, non-intuitive reason, and offers a new path forward. For over a century law firms, investment banks, accounting firms, credit rating agencies and companies seeking regular access to U.S. capital markets made large investments in their reputations.  They treated customers well and sometimes endured losses in transactions or business deals in order to sustain and nurture their reputations as faithful brokers and “gate-keepers.”  This has changed completely. The existing business model among leading participants in today’s capital markets no longer treats customers as valued clients whose trust must be earned and nurtured, but as one-off “counter-parties” to whom no duties are owed and no loyalty is required.  The rough and tumble norms of the market-place have replaced the long-standing reputational model in U.S. finance. \n\nThis book describes the transformation inAmerican financefrom the old reputational model to the existing laissez faire model and argues that the change came as a result of threefactors: (1) the growth of reliance on regulation rather than reputation as the primary mechanism for protecting customers and (2) the increasing complexity of regulation, which made technical expertise rather than reputation the primary criterion on which customers choose who to do business with in today’s markets; and (3) the rise of the “cult of personality” on Wall Street, which has led to a secular demise in the relevance of companies’ reputations and the concomitant rise of individual “rain-makers” reputation as the basis for premium pricing of financial services.This compelling book will drive the debate about the financial crisis and financial regulation for years to come--both inside and outside the industry.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Corporate Valuation"]},{"id":"9781947098985","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"A Communication Guide for Investor Relations in an Age of Activism","authors":["Marcia W.

This generative ensemble learns continually from small and noisy financial datasets while seamlessly enabling probabilistic inference, retrodiction, prediction, and counterfactual reasoning. Probabilistic ML also lets you systematically encode personal, empirical, and institutional knowledge into ML models.\n\nWhether they're based on academic theories or ML strategies, all financial models are subject to modeling errors that can be mitigated but not eliminated. Probabilistic ML systems treat uncertainties and errors of financial and investing systems as features, not bugs. And they quantify uncertainty generated from inexact inputs and outputs as probability distributions, not point estimates. This makes for realistic financial inferences and predictions that are useful for decision-making and risk management.\n\nUnlike conventional AI, these systems are capable of warning us when their inferences and predictions are no longer useful in the current market environment. By moving away from flawed statistical methodologies and a restrictive conventional view of probability as a limiting frequency, you’ll move toward an intuitive view of probability as logic within an axiomatic statistical framework that comprehensively and successfully quantifies uncertainty.

Built around a full-length case study of Wal-Mart, it shows you how to perform an in-depth analysis of that company's financial standing, walking you through all the steps of developing a sophisticated financial model as done by professional Wall Street analysts. You will construct a full scale financial model and valuation step-by-step as you page through the book.\n\nThe New York School of Finance, founded by Mr. Pignataro, has trained thousands of business students and practitioners, and hundreds of bulge bracket banks and investment funds worldwide.

Perella"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"April 2020","description":"A timely update to the global bestselling book on investment banking and valuation – this new edition reflects valuable contributions from Nasdaq and the global law firm Latham & Watkins LLP plus access to the online valuation models and course.\n\nIn the constantly evolving world of finance, a solid technical foundation is an essential tool for success. Due to the fast-paced nature of this world, however, no one was able to take the time to properly codify its lifeblood--namely, valuation and dealmaking. Rosenbaum and Pearl originally responded to this need in 2009 by writing the first edition of the book that they wish had existed when they were trying to break into Wall Street. Investment Banking: Valuation, LBOs, M&A, and IPOs, 3rd Edition is a highly accessible and authoritative book written by investment bankers that explains how to perform the valuation work and financial analysis at the core of Wall Street – comparable companies, precedent transactions, DCF, LBO, M&A analysis...and now IPO analytics and valuation. Using a step-by-step, how-to approach for each methodology, the authors build a chronological knowledge base and define key terms, financial concepts, and processes throughout the book. The genesis for the original book stemmed from the authors' personal experiences as students interviewing for investment banking positions. As they both independently went through the rigorous process, they realized that their classroom experiences were a step removed from how valuation and financial analysis were performed in real-world situations. Consequently, they created this book to provide a leg up to those individuals seeking or beginning careers on Wall Street – from students at undergraduate universities and graduate schools to \"career changers\" looking to break into finance. Now, over 10 years after the release of the first edition, the book is more relevant and topical than ever. It is used in over 200 universities globally and has become a go-to resource for investment banks, private equity, investment firms, and corporations undertaking M&A transactions, LBOs, IPOs, restructurings, and investment decisions. While the fundamentals haven't changed, the environment must adapt to changing market developments and conditions. As a result, Rosenbaum and Pearl have updated their widely adopted book accordingly, turning the latest edition of Investment Banking: Valuation, LBOs, M&A, and IPOs into a unique and comprehensive training package, which includes:\n\nTwo new chapters covering IPOs plus insightful contributions from Nasdaq, the leading U.S. exchange and technology provider for IPOs and new listings, and global law firm Latham & Watkins LLP\nAccess to six downloadable valuation model templates, including Comparable Companies Analysis, Precedent Transactions Analysis, Discounted Cash Flow Analysis, Leveraged Buyout Analysis, and M&A models\nSix-month access to online Wiley Investment Banking Valuation Course featuring bite-sized lessons, over five hours of video lectures, 100+ practice questions, and other investment banking study tools\n\nLaunch your career on Wall Street and hone your financial expertise with Rosenbaum and Pearl’s real-world knowledge and forward-looking guidance in the latest edition of Investment Banking: Valuation, LBOs, M&A, and IPOs.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Banking"]},{"id":"9781040044377","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Voice & Vision, 4th Edition","authors":["Mick Hurbis-Cherrier","Gustavo Mercado"],"pages":"672","publication_date":"May 2025","description":"Develop your creative voice whilst acquiring the practical skills and confidence to use it with this fully updated new edition.

All organizations are impacted by it, most wish that they had less of it, but need help in understanding the nature of the beast. This book aims to clear up any misconceptions and show you how to implement a sound technical debt management program to suit your company’s needs.\n\nYou’ll learn the greatest challenge in solving the technical debt dilemma is not to find solutions to it, but rather to find solutions to the human and organizational issues that lead to that debt. For example, convincing senior stakeholders of the importance of addressing technical debt, getting stakeholders to acknowledge how their actions lead to unintentional debt, and enabling teams to prioritize technical debt over short-term goals.\n\nTherefore, this book is divided into three parts: defining technical debt, understanding technical debt, and tackling technical debt. It begins by explaining why technical debt should not be considered a technical problem, but rather a problem of how trade-off decisions are made. You’ll then examine how making decisions using the affect heuristic, more commonly known as a “gut feeling,” can lead to unnecessary technical debt, followed by some techniques for combating your vulnerability to this trap.\n\nReducing your organization’s level of technical debt is not easy.

Where do you go from here?  Well, this book discusses and dissects this case study approach.  \n\nSeemingly good backtest performance isn't enough to justify trading real money. You need to perform rigorous statistical tests of the system's validity. Then, if basic tests confirm the quality of your idea, you need to tune your system, not just for best performance, but also for robust behavior in the face of inevitable market changes. Next, you need to quantify its expected future behavior, assessing how bad its real-life performance might actually be, and whether you can live with that. Finally, you need to find its theoretical performance limits so you know if its actual trades conform to this theoretical expectation, enabling you to dump the system if it does not liveup to expectations.\n\nThis book does not contain any sure-fire, guaranteed-riches trading systems. Those are a dime a dozen... But if you have a trading system, this book will provide you with a set of tools that will help you evaluate the potential value of your system, tweak it to improve its profitability, and monitor its on-going performance to detect deterioration before it fails catastrophically. Any serious market trader would do well to employ the methods described in this book.\n\nWhat You Will Learn\n\nSee how the 'spaghetti-on-the-wall' approach to trading system development can be done legitimately\nDetect overfitting early in development\nEstimate the probability that your system's backtest results could have been due to just good luck\nRegularize a predictive model so it automatically selects an optimal subset of indicator candidates\nRapidly find the global optimum for any type of parameterized trading system\nAssess the ruggedness of your trading system against market changes\nEnhance the stationarity and information content of your proprietary indicators\nNest one layer of walkforward analysis inside another layer to account for selection bias in complex trading systems\nCompute a lower bound on your system's mean future performance\nBound expected periodic returns to detect on-going system deterioration before it becomes severe\nEstimate the probability of catastrophic drawdown\n\n Who This Book Is For\n\nExperienced C++ programmers, developers, and software engineers.  Prior experience with rigorous statistical procedures to evaluate and maximize the quality of systems is recommended as well.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Financial Markets","Technical Analysis"]},{"id":"9781394271771","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Decentralized Finance and the End of Traditional Banking","authors":["Jyoti Verma","Amandeep Singh","Gagandeep"],"pages":"400","publication_date":"October 2025","description":"This book provides the essential knowledge needed to navigate the revolutionary future of finance with confidence through its comprehensive and accessible exploration of decentralized finance.\n\nThis book is an in-depth exploration of the transformative power of decentralized finance (DeFi) and its potential to revolutionize the global financial system through in-depth analyses of the rise of DeFi, covering a wide range of topics such as cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology, smart contracts, decentralized exchanges, stablecoins, governance, and more.

Due to the fast-paced nature of this world, however, no one has been able to take the time to properly codify the lifeblood of the corporate financier's work—namely, valuation. Rosenbaum and Pearl have responded to this need by writing the book that they wish had existed when they were trying to break into Wall Street.\n\nInvestment Banking: Valuation, Leveraged Buyouts, and Mergers & Acquisitions is a highly accessible and authoritative book that focuses on the primary valuation methodologies currently used on Wall Street—comparable companies, precedent transactions, DCF, and LBO analysis. These methodologies are used to determine valuation for public and private companies within the context of M&A transactions, LBOs, IPOs, restructurings, and investment decisions. Using a step-by-step how-to approach for each methodology, the authors build a chronological knowledge base and define key terms, financial concepts, and processes throughout the book. They also provide a comprehensive overview of the fundamentals of LBOs and an organized M&A sale process.\n\nIn the aftermath of the subprime mortgage crisis and ensuing credit crunch, the world of finance is returning to the fundamentals of valuation and critical due diligence. This involves the use of more realistic assumptions governing approach to risk as well as a wide range of value drivers. While valuation has always involved a great deal of \"art\" in addition to time-tested \"science,\" the artistry is perpetually evolving in accordance with market developments and conditions. In this sense, this book is particularly topical—in addition to detailing the technical fundamentals behind valuation, the authors infuse practical judgment skills and perspective to help guide the science.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Banking"]},{"id":"9781118793992","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"The Warren Buffett Way, + Website, 3rd Edition","authors":["Robert G.

Boudreault and Renaud answer the need for a clear, application-oriented guide to the growing field of actuarial finance with this volume, which focuses on the mathematical models and techniques used in actuarial finance for the pricing and hedging of actuarial liabilities exposed to financial markets and other contingencies. With roots in modern financial mathematics, actuarial finance presents unique challenges due to the long-term nature of insurance liabilities, the presence of mortality or other contingencies and the structure and regulations of the insurance and pension markets.\n\nMotivated, designed and written for and by actuaries, this book puts actuarial applications at the forefront in addition to balancing mathematics and finance at an adequate level to actuarial undergraduates. While the classical theory of financial mathematics is discussed, the authors provide a thorough grounding in such crucial topics as recognizing embedded options in actuarial liabilities, adequately quantifying and pricing liabilities, and using derivatives and other assets to manage actuarial and financial risks.\n\nActuarial applications are emphasized and illustrated with about 300 examples and 200 exercises. The book also comprises end-of-chapter point-form summaries to help the reader review the most important concepts. Additional topics and features include:\n\nCompares pricing in insurance and financial markets\nDiscusses event-triggered derivatives such as weather, catastrophe and longevity derivatives and how they can be used for risk management;\nIntroduces equity-linked insurance and annuities (EIAs, VAs), relates them to common derivatives and how to manage mortality for these products\nIntroduces pricing and replication in incomplete markets and analyze the impact of market incompleteness on insurance and risk management;\nPresents immunization techniques alongside Greeks-based hedging;\nCovers in detail how to delta-gamma/rho/vega hedge a liability and how to rebalance periodically a hedging portfolio.\n\nThis text will prove itself a firm foundation for undergraduate courses in financial mathematics or economics, actuarial mathematics or derivative markets. It is also highly applicable to current and future actuaries preparing for the exams or actuary professionals looking for a valuable addition to their reference shelf. \n\nAs of 2019, the book covers significant parts of the Society of Actuaries’ Exams FM, IFM and QFI Core, and the Casualty Actuarial Society’s Exams 2 and 3F. It is assumed the reader has basic skills in calculus (differentiation and integration of functions), probability (at the level of the Society of Actuaries’ Exam P), interest theory (time value of money) and, ideally, a basic understanding of elementary stochastic processes such as random walks.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance"]},{"id":"9780429534317","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Studio Television Production and Directing, 3rd Edition","authors":["Andrew Hicks Utterback"],"pages":"214","publication_date":"June 2023","description":"This updated third edition introduces readers to the basic fundamentals of studio and control room production.

This book emphasizes the translational aspect, while first building an intuitive, technical understanding that allows market makers, portfolio managers, investment managers, risk managers, and other traders to work more effectively within—and beyond—the bounds of everyday practice.\n\nGain a deeper understanding of the assumptions underlying options theory\nTranslate theoretical ideas into practice\nDevelop a more accurate intuition for better time-constrained decision making\n\nThis book allows its readers to gain more than a superficial understanding of the mechanisms at work in options markets.

If you are new to the MIDAS method, I recommend first reading the introductory chapters, then jumping to the very practical, money-making Chapter 8, then applying the principles yourself (computer code is provided in the appendices). Armed with 'hands-on' knowledge, you will then access the wealth of information that this book provides in helping you correctly read the markets.\"\n\n— Pascal Willain, independent trader and inventor of volume-based indicators, author of Value in Time\n\n\"As the first person to ever write about the Commitments of Traders Report way back in 1973, I have seen the data abused and usually greatly misunderstood. Most people writing on the subject just don't understand it and you will be misled. Chapter 12 in this book sets the record straight. I am delighted to give a 100% endorsement, the truth of the COT report is here, simply stated and easy to understand. Don't put this book down. Take it to the checkout and buy it.\"\n\n— Larry Williams, private trader, author\n\n\"Coles and Hawkins have masterfully combined the 'art and science of Technical Analysis' into a well-illustrated and comprehensive tome encompassing the MIDAS method.

This book will give any trader the unconventional alternative edge they need to take advantage of the stock market and exploit profits.\"\n\n—StockShare Publishing LLC\n\n\"The authors pick up where Levine left off, boldly and competently tackling both the theoretical aspects of Levine's MIDAS method, as well as providing concrete practical trading applications. There were some delightful diversions as well, including a superb overview of how to mechanically apply the statistics in the CFTC Commitments of Traders report.

I am particularly delighted to see the recognition of volume as a powerful and often neglected tool. This integration of methods should serve as a profitable tool for those who are willing to do the work to understand why markets move.

Arms, author, advisor to institutions, and developer of many tools such as The Arms Index and Equivolume charting\n\n\"I started using MIDAS from the time Paul Levine began publishing his articles in instalments. In the intervening years, I have made MIDAS my own. And I did think it was unlikely that Coles' and Hawkins' book would bring fresh insights. Boy was I wrong! This is an amazing book. Most books tend to be practical to the exclusion of the theory – theory that is so necessary if we are to adjust a tool when it 'stops working;' or tend to be so theoretical as to be impractical. MIDAS Technical Analysis straddles both worlds with ease. As a result, the book is both a reference work and a practical 'to do' volume. What I like most about Coles and Hawkins is they have taken Levine's original idea and conquered new realms with it: they have incorporated MIDAS with other technical tools so that the work should appeal to traders of many and varied disciplines. In my view, this is a must-have book and it shall certainly occupy a space in my shelves.\"\n\n— Ray Barros, CEO, BarroMetrics Investments Inc","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Financial Markets","Technical Analysis"]},{"id":"9781118691649","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Entrepreneurial Finance: Fundamentals of Financial Planning and Management for Small Business","authors":["M.

Middle market direct lending has traditionally been relegated to commercial banks, but onerous Dodd-Frank regulation has opened the opportunity for private asset managers to replace banks as corporate lenders; as direct loans have thus far escaped the low rates that decimate yield, this asset class has become an increasingly attractive option for institutional and retail investors.\n\nThis book dissects direct loans as a class, providing the critical background information needed in order to work effectively with these assets.\n\nUnderstand direct lending as an asset class, and the different types of loans available\nExamine the opportunities, potential risks, and historical yield\nDelve into various loan investment vehicles, including the Business Development Company structure\nLearn how to structure a direct loan portfolio, and where it fits within your total portfolio\n\nThe rapid rise of direct lending left a knowledge gap surrounding these nontraditional assets, leaving many investors ill-equipped to take full advantage of ever-increasing growth. This book provides a uniquely comprehensive guide to corporate direct lending, acting as both crash course and desk reference to facilitate smart investment decision making.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Financial Markets","Securities"]},{"id":"9781119551911","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The PAYTECH Book","authors":["Susanne Chishti","Tony Craddock","Robert Courtneidge"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"February 2020","description":"The only globally-crowdsourced book on the future of payments (“PayTech”), offering comprehensive understanding of a rapidly evolving industry at the centre of global commerce\n\nThe movement of money between individuals, organisations and governments is crucial to the world economy.

In Quantitative Value, Wesley Gray and Tobias Carlisle take the best aspects from the disciplines of value investing and quantitative investing and apply them to a completely unique and winning approach to stock selection. As the authors explain, the quantitative value strategy offers a superior way to invest: capture the benefits of a value investing philosophy without the behavioral errors associated with \"stock picking.\" To demystify their innovative approach, Gray and Carlisle outline the framework for quantitative value investing, including the four key elements the investment process:\n\n1) How to avoid stocks that can cause a permanent loss of capital: Learn how to uncover financial statement manipulation, fraud, and financial distress.\n\n2) How to find stocks with the highest quality: Learn how to find strong economic franchises, and robust financial strength.

Although it was intended that this increased realism would allow viewers to appreciate the emotional state of characters, research has shown that audiences often have a negative reaction as the human likeness of a character increases. This phenomenon, known as the Uncanny Valley, has become a benchmark for measuring if a character is believably realistic and authentically human like. This book is an essential guide on how to overcome the Uncanny Valley phenomenon when designing human-like characters in digital applications.\n\nIn this book, the author provides a synopsis of literature about the Uncanny Valley phenomenon and explains how it was introduced into contemporary thought. She then presents her theories on its possible psychological causes based on a series of empirical studies. The book focuses on how aspects of facial expression and speech can be manipulated to overcome the Uncanny Valley in character design.\n\nThe Uncanny Valley in Games and Animation presents a novel theory that goes beyond previous research in that the cause of the Uncanny Valley is based on a perceived lack of empathy in a character. This book makes an original, scholarly contribution to our current understanding of the Uncanny Valley phenomenon and fills a gap in the literature by assessing the biological and social roots of the Uncanny Valley and its implications for computer-graphics animation.","tags":["Design","Visual Design","Film & Video","Animation"]},{"id":"9781118989807","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Currency Trading For Dummies, 3rd Edition","authors":["Kathleen Brooks","Brian Dolan"],"pages":"384","publication_date":"February 2015","description":"Your plain-English guide to currency trading\n\nCurrency Trading For Dummies is a hands-on, user-friendly guide that explains how the foreign exchange (ForEx) market works and how you can become a part of it.

Programmers need to know that their code will be safe in an almost infinite number of scenarios and configurations. Static source code analysis gives users the ability to review their work with a fine-toothed comb and uncover the kinds of errors that lead directly to security vulnerabilities. Now, there’s a complete guide to static analysis: how it works, how to integrate it into the software development processes, and how to make the most of it during security code review. Static analysis experts Brian Chess and Jacob West look at the most common types of security defects that occur today. They illustrate main points using Java and C code examples taken from real-world security incidents, showing how coding errors are exploited, how they could have been prevented, and how static analysis can rapidly uncover similar mistakes. This book is for everyone concerned with building more secure software: developers, security engineers, analysts, and testers.\n\nCoverage includes:\n\n  Why conventional bug-catching often misses security problems\n\n  How static analysis can help programmers get security right\n\n  The critical attributes and algorithms that make or break a static analysis tool\n\n  36 techniques for making static analysis more effective on your code\n\n  More than 70 types of serious security vulnerabilities, with specific solutions\n\n  Example vulnerabilities from Firefox, OpenSSH, MySpace, eTrade, Apache httpd, and many more\n\n  Techniques for handling untrusted input\n\n  Eliminating buffer overflows: tactical and strategic approaches\n\n  Avoiding errors specific to Web applications, Web services, and Ajax\n\n  Security-aware logging, debugging, and error/exception handling\n\n  Creating, maintaining, and sharing secrets and confidential information\n\n  Detailed tutorials that walk you through the static analysis process\n\n“We designed Java so that it could be analyzed statically.

Fixed Income Securities, Third Edition by Bruce Tuckman and Angel Serrat is designed to balance these three objectives. The book presents theory without unnecessary abstraction; quantitative techniques with a minimum of mathematics; and conventions at a useful level of detail.\n\nThe book begins with an overview of global fixed income markets and continues with the fundamentals, namely, arbitrage pricing, interest rates, risk metrics, and term structure models to price contingent claims. Subsequent chapters cover individual markets and securities: repo, rate and bond forwards and futures, interest rate and basis swaps, credit markets, fixed income options, and mortgage-backed-securities.\n\nFixed Income Securities, Third Edition is full of examples, applications, and case studies. Practically every quantitative concept is illustrated through real market data. This practice-oriented approach makes the book particularly useful for the working professional.\n\nThis third edition is a considerable revision and expansion of the second. Most examples have been updated. The chapters on fixed income options and mortgage-backed securities have been considerably expanded to include a broader range of securities and valuation methodologies. Also, three new chapters have been added: the global overview of fixed income markets; a chapter on corporate bonds and credit default swaps; and a chapter on discounting with bases, which is the foundation for the relatively recent practice of discounting swap cash flows with curves based on money market rates.\n\n[FOR THE UNIVERSITY EDITION]\n\nThis university edition includes problems which students can use to test and enhance their understanding of the text.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Financial Markets","Securities"]},{"id":"9781118417201","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Modern Portfolio Theory: Foundations, Analysis, and New Developments, + Website","authors":["Jack Clark Francis","Dongcheol Kim"],"pages":"554","publication_date":"January 2013","description":"A through guide covering Modern Portfolio Theory as well as the recent developments surrounding it\n\nModern portfolio theory (MPT), which originated with Harry Markowitz's seminal paper \"Portfolio Selection\" in 1952, has stood the test of time and continues to be the intellectual foundation for real-world portfolio management.

Wealth management practitioners are commonly taught the traditional mean-variance approach in CFA and similar curricula, a method with increasingly limited applicability given the evolution of investment products and our understanding of real-world client preferences. Additionally, financial advisors and researchers typically receive little to no training on how to implement a robust asset allocation framework, a conceptually simple yet practically very challenging task. This timely book offers professional wealth managers and researchers an up-to-date and implementable toolset for managing client portfolios. \n\nThe information presented in this book far exceeds the basic models and heuristics most commonly used today, presenting advances in asset allocation that have been isolated to academic and institutional portfolio management settings until now, while simultaneously providing a clear framework that advisors can immediately deploy. This rigorous manuscript covers all aspects of creating client portfolios: setting client risk preferences, deciding which assets to include in the portfolio mix, forecasting future asset performance, and running an optimization to set a final allocation. An important resource for all wealth management fiduciaries, this book enables readers to:\n\nImplement a rigorous yet streamlined asset allocation framework that they can stand behind with conviction\nDeploy both neo-classical and behavioral elements of client preferences to more accurately establish a client risk profile\nIncorporate client financial goals into the asset allocation process systematically and precisely with a simple balance sheet model\nCreate a systematic framework for justifying which assets should be included in client portfolios\nBuild capital market assumptions from historical data via a statistically sound and intuitive process\nRun optimization methods that respect complex client preferences and real-world asset characteristics\n\nModern Asset Allocation for Wealth Management is ideal for practicing financial advisors and researchers in both traditional and robo-advisor settings, as well as advanced undergraduate and graduate courses on asset allocation.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance"]},{"id":"9781430244431","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Traders at Work: How the World's Most Successful Traders Make Their Living in the Markets","authors":["Tim Bourquin","Nicholas Mango"],"pages":"220","publication_date":"January 2013","description":"Shortly after most novice traders discover how trading works and begin to realize that they have the potential to make unlimited amounts of money in the financial markets, they start dreaming the near-impossible dream. They fantasize about buying that condo in Boca Raton for their parents or surprising their son with a brand-new car on his 16th birthday. They even begin to imagine themselves opening their own trading firm or milling about the pit of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, lobbying against other professional traders for the perfect entry into a once-in-a-lifetime trade. But then ... they watch the markets lurch in wildly unpredictable ways, lose their shirts in a few live trades, and then freeze in their tracks, wondering if they will ever be able to consistently trade in a manner that can even loosely be defined as \"profitable.\"\n\nTo be sure, becoming a full-time, professional trader, working at a proprietary trading firm, or managing the trading activity of a hedge fund may sound like the perfect career, but it's all too easy for beginner traders to overestimate their trading abilities, underestimate the movements of the markets, and find themselves in a financial hole of epic proportions after a few bad trades. So what does it really take to make a living in the markets? Tim Bourquin, co-founder of Traders Expo and the Forex Trading Expo and founder of TraderInterviews.com, and freelance writer and editor Nick Mango set out to answer that exact question in Traders at Work, a unique collection of over 20 interviews with some of the world's most successful professional traders, from at-home hobbyists who have opened their own firms to those working at hedge funds, on proprietary trading desks, and in exchange pits.\n\nWhat mistakes did Anne-Marie Baiynd make early in her career? What does Michael Toma wish he had known about trading? What trading strategies work best for Linda Raschke?

Bourquin and Mango ask all of these questions and more in Traders at Work and in doing so reveal insider insights on what it takes to be a successful trader from those who are living that dream. Fascinating, compelling, and filled with never-before-told stories from the front lines of the trading arena, Traders at Work is required reading for anyone who has ever asked themselves if they have what it takes to trade for a living.\n\nWhat you'll learn\n\nHow some of the world's best traders became consistently profitable in the markets, quit their day jobs, and made the career transition to full-time trading\n\nHow to manage the roller coaster of your emotions and make smarter trading decisions in up, down, and sideways markets\n\nDaily techniques for minimizing your trading risks while maximizing your profit potential\n\nInsider stories from some of the most well-recognized prop desks and hedge funds in the financial industry\n\nThe most common mistakes leading traders made early on in their careers and how to avoid making them yourself\n\nWho this book is for\n\nTraders at Work is a book for active beginner to advanced retail traders, those thinking about trying their hand at trading, and those with retirement accounts or mutual funds who want to take a more active role in the management of their finances.

Often overlooked by traders focused solely on price reversals or continuation signals, momentum provides a context to price behavior and to the price trend, and can vastly improves the timing of both entry and exit of trades.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Financial Markets","Technical Analysis"]},{"id":"9781000098334","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Producing for TV and Emerging Media, 4th Edition","authors":["Dustin Morrow","Kacey Morrow"],"pages":"384","publication_date":"July 2020","description":"Gain a thorough understanding of the nuanced and multidimensional role producers play in television and emerging media today to harness the creative, technical, interpersonal, and financial skills essential for success in this vibrant and challenging field.","tags":["Design","Visual Design","Film & Video","Television Production"]},{"id":"9781317383864","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Lighting for Digital Video and Television, 4th Edition","authors":["John Jackman"],"pages":"294","publication_date":"June 2020","description":"This book gives a comprehensive overview of lighting equipment and techniques for digital production.

The author presents the theories of stochastic processes and stochastic calculus and provides the necessary tools for modeling and pricing in finance and insurance. Practical in focus, the book's emphasis is on application, intuition, and computation, rather than theory.\n\nConsequently, the text is of interest to graduate students, researchers, and practitioners interested in these areas. While the text is self-contained, an introductory course in probability theory is beneficial to prospective readers.\n\nThis book evolved from the author's experience as an instructor and has been thoroughly classroom-tested. Following an introduction, the author sets forth the fundamental information and tools needed by researchers and practitioners working in the financial and insurance industries:\n\nOverview of Probability Theory\n\nDiscrete-Time stochastic processes\n\nContinuous-time stochastic processes\n\nStochastic calculus: basic topics\n\nThe final two chapters, Stochastic Calculus: Advanced Topics and Applications in Insurance, are devoted to more advanced topics. Readers learn the Feynman-Kac formula, the Girsanov's theorem, and complex barrier hitting times distributions. Finally, readers discover how stochastic analysis and principles are applied in practice through two insurance examples: valuation of equity-linked annuities under a stochastic interest rate environment and calculation of reserves for universal life insurance.\n\nThroughout the text, figures and tables are used to help simplify complex theory and pro-cesses. An extensive bibliography opens up additional avenues of research to specialized topics.\n\nIdeal for upper-level undergraduate and graduate students, this text is recommended for one-semester courses in stochastic finance and calculus. It is also recommended as a study guide for professionals taking Causality Actuarial Society (CAS) and Society of Actuaries (SOA) actuarial examinations.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance"]},{"id":"9781118591826","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"International Finance For Dummies","authors":["Ayse Y.

But despite this, there are very few capital allocation experts on the boards of the largest publicly traded companies, and academic research consistently finds that most firms deploy capital sub-optimally.\n\nCapital Allocation aims to educate senior leaders, board members, investors, students, and anyone interested in business on this important topic. Until now very little has been written on capital allocation outside of academia, even though the strategic deployment of excess capital is an increasingly significant source of competitive advantage for many companies.\n\nDavid Giroux, Chief Investment Officer for Equities and Multi-Asset and Head of Investment Strategy at T. Rowe Price, covers the entire gamut of capital allocation issues, including optimal capital structure, capital allocation alternatives, mergers & acquisitions, and special situations. Capital Allocation walks you through this critical topic from beginning to end, including:\n\nStories of companies that allocated capital in ways that created significant shareholder value\nSeveral real-life decision-making models you can use for strategically allocating your firm’s capital\nGuidelines for generating high returns in the long term to build sustainable shareholder wealth\nGiroux uses academic research, personal experience, and uncomplicated mathematics to reveal approaches and actions that create long-term value. He provides case studies from Kodak, Comcast, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Danaher, General Electric, Microsoft, and others showing how capital allocation has―and hasn’t―worked in real-life situations. And he shows how to use capital allocation to head off possible activist investors.\n\nCapital Allocation offers everything you need to know for deploying capital wisely to outperform your competitors over the long term.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Corporate Valuation"]},{"id":"9780323984157","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Public Finance, 4th Edition","authors":["Richard W.

This book offers managers a complete analysis of the various facets of commercial credit and presents an analysis of the various types of markets, instruments, and risks associated with trade credit in supply chains across the globe.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance"]},{"id":"9780444594655","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Handbook of the Economics of Finance SET:Volumes 2A & 2B","authors":["George M.

They’re not merely conspicuous: they represent price jumps that could signal profitable trading opportunities. Until now, however, \"folklore\" about gap trading has been common, and tested, research-based knowledge virtually nonexistent. In Technical Analysis of Gaps, renowned technical analysis researchers Julie Dahlquist and Richard Bauer change all that. Drawing on 60 years of comprehensive data, they demonstrate how to sort \"strategic\" gaps from trivial ones, and successfully trade on gaps identified as significant. Building on work that recently earned them the Market Technicians Association’s 2011 Charles H. Dow Award for creativity and innovation in technical analysis, Dahlquist and Bauer offer specific gap-related trading tips for stocks, futures, and options. They consider a wide variety of market conditions, including gap size, volume and previous price movement, illuminating their findings with easy-to-understand diagrams.

It focuses on giving the reader mastery over the concepts, methods and metrics of digital video coding, so that readers have sufficient understanding to choose and tune coding parameters for optimum results that would suit their particular needs for quality, compression, speed and power.\n\nThe practical aspects are many: Uploading video to the Internet is only the beginning of a trend where a consumer controls video quality and speed by trading off various other factors. Open source and proprietary applications such as video e-mail, private party content generation, editing and archiving, and cloud asset management would give further control to the end-user.\n\nDigital video is frequently compressed and coded for easier storage and transmission. This process involves visual quality loss due to typical data compression techniques and requires use of high performance computing systems. A careful balance between the amount of compression, the visual quality loss and the coding speed is necessary to keep the total system cost down, while delivering a good user experience for various video applications. At the same time, power consumption optimizations are also essential to get the job done on inexpensive consumer platforms.\n\nTrade-offs can be made among these factors, and relevant considerations are particularly important in resource-constrained low power devices. To better understand the trade-offs this book discusses a comprehensive set of engineering principles, strategies, methods and metrics. It also exposes readers to approaches on how to differentiate and rank video coding solutions.","tags":["Design","Visual Design","Film & Video","Video Production"]},{"id":"9780240520605","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Stop Motion: Passion, Process and Performance","authors":["Barry C Purves"],"pages":"372","publication_date":"October 2012","description":"Be inspired by award-winning animator Barry Purves' honest insight into the creative process of making stop motion animations, using his own classic films to illustrate every step along the way.

Financial market behaviour revolves around economic concepts, however the majority of economic textbooks do not tell the full story. To fully understand the behaviour of financial markets it is essential to have a model that enables new information to be absorbed and analysed with some predictive implications. That model is provided by the business cycle. 'Economics for Financial Markets' takes the reader from the basics of financial market valuation to a more sophisticated understanding of the actions that traders take which ultimately drives the volatility in the financial markets. The author shows traders, investment managers, risk managers and finance professionals how to distil the flow of information and show what needs to be concentrated on, covering topics such as:* Why are financial markets subject to economic fashions?* How has the New Economy changed financial market behaviour? * Does the creation of the euro fundamentally change the behaviour of the currency markets?Shows how to distil the vast amount of information in financial markets and identify what is importantDemonstrates how the \"New Economy\" had changed financial market behaviourExplains how to follow the behaviour of central banks","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Financial Markets"]},{"id":"9780273751830","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"FT Guide to Foreign Exchange Trading","authors":["Stuart Fieldhouse"],"pages":"208","publication_date":"May 2015","description":"An introduction to the fast growing $1.5 billion foreign exchange trading marketplace, showing you how the markets work, how to trade them successfully and how to mitigate risk.\n\nThe Financial Times Guide to Foreign Exchange Tradingis the authoritative primer, the first port of call for anyone interested in foreign exchange trading and wants to know what it is all about before taking the plunge.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Financial Markets","Forex"]},{"id":"9780470686324","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Risk Controllers: Central Counterparty Clearing in Globalised Financial Markets","authors":["Peter Norman"],"pages":"416","publication_date":"May 2011","description":"Clearing houses, or CCPs, were among the very few organisations to emerge from the global financial crisis with their standing enhanced. In the chaotic aftermath of the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, they successfully completed trades worth trillions of dollars in a multitude of financial instruments across listed and over-the-counter markets, and so helped avert financial Armageddon.\n\nThat success transformed the business of clearing. Governments and regulators around the world gave CCPs and the clearing services they provide a front-line role in protecting the global economy from future excesses of finance. CCPs, which mitigate risk in financial markets, responded by greatly expanding their activities, notably in markets for over-the-counter derivatives, and often in fierce competition with one another.\n\nIn The Risk Controllers, journalist and author Peter Norman describes how CCPs operate, how they handled the Lehman default, and the challenges they now face. Because central counterparty clearing is a complex business with a long history that continues to influence decisions and structures even in today's fast changing world, The Risk Controllers explores the development of CCPs and clearing from the earliest times to the present.\n\nIt draws on the experiences of the people who helped to shape the business of clearing today. It sets the development of CCPs and clearing in the broader context of changes in society, politics and regulation. The book examines turning points, such as the 1987 stock market crash, that set clearing on a new path and the impact of long running trends, including the exponential growth of computer power and the ebb and flow of globalisation.\n\nWritten in non-technical language, The Risk Controllers provides a unique and accessible guide to CCPs and clearing. It is essential reading for clearing professionals, legislators and regulators whose job it is to take this vitally important business into the future.\n\n\"The recent crisis has, thankfully, renewed interest in the importance of central counterparties: how they can help preserve stability or, as Hong Kong showed in 1987, undermine stability if they are not super sound. Peter Norman's book places the role of clearing houses in a historical context, and explains why the financial system's plumbing matters so much. It should be read by anyone interested in building safer capital markets.\"\n\nPaul Tucker, Deputy Governor Financial Stability, Bank of England","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Financial Markets"]},{"id":"9781317632436","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Film Theory: The Basics","authors":["Kevin McDonald"],"pages":"196","publication_date":"February 2016","description":"Film Theory: The Basics provides an accessible introduction to the key theorists, concepts, and debates that have shaped the study of moving images.

Management teams have a broad representation from the c-suite of a broad spectrum of participants ranging from a fintech to a bank with over $30bn in assets.\n\nBanks are the oil that lubricates the economy. An understanding of how they operate is essential for analyzing any part of the economy since banks represent a large investing universe and control a sizeable portion of assets. With over 800 public tickers representing over $3 trillion market cap, banks are larger than several other industry groups. Banks are the largest financial intermediaries in the U.S., controlling $15 trillion in financial assets. Their relative size can amplify effects. For example, a small regulatory or environmental change can cascade and ripple through financial markets and have a major impact on the economy.\n\nAs fintechs gain in prominence, a fundamental grasp of topics related to banking will help enhance understanding of fintech.\n\nBank investing can be a fruitful pursuit:\n\nThe most successful investor of our times, Warren Buffett, has had a sizeable investment in banks over time (close to a third of his portfolio weight used to be in banks).\nBanks allow you to make macro-economic bets since they are highly levered to business cycles.\nBank investing allows you to scale your knowledge, as they have relatively homogenized business models...\n...at the same time, banks are diverse enough to drive meaningful dispersion in price performance.

The financial system had become the source of its own instability through a combination of greed, lousy underwriting, fake ratings and regulatory negligence. From that date, governments tried to put together a new regulatory framework that would avoid using taxpayer money for bailout of banks. In an uncoordinated effort, they produced a series of vertical regulations that are disconnected from one another. That will not be sufficient to stop finance from being instable and the need for international and horizontal regulation is urgent. This challenge is the focus of Georges Ugeux's book.\n\nInternational Finance Regulation: The Quest for Financial Stability focuses on the inspirations behind regulation, and examines the risks and consequences of fragmentation on a global scale. Author Georges Ugeux has four decades of experience in the legal and economic aspects of international business operations. He created and run the New York Stock Exchange'sinternational group in charge of developing the NYSE's reach to non-US companies, including relationships with regulators and governments. Ugeux teaches European Banking and Finance of the Columbia University School of Law. Ugeux is uniquely positioned to provide recommendations and suggestions from the perspective of a top global authority. In the book, he explores international regulation with topics such as:\n\nLaws, regulations, and risks of overregulation\n\nTransformation of the U.S. market and creation of the Eurozone\n\nDevelopment of a global framework and stability of the banking system\n\nIn-depth examination of Basel III, the Dodd-Frank Act, the European Banking Union, and the Volcker Rule\n\nThe book also contains case studies from real-world scenarios like Lehman, CDS, Greece, the London Whale, and Libor to illustrate the concepts presented. Finance consistently operates within an increasingly global paradigm, and an overarching regulation scheme is becoming more and more necessary for sustainable growth.

This book is designed as a resource that can help managers quickly understand and navigate the FX market. The text may be used as an introductory module in a course in international finance, whether the course is oriented to international markets, international investments, or international corporate finance. The primary intended audience is an applied MBA course aimed at executives, managers, and would-be managers. After an introduction to FX rates, the author covers the important topic FX rate valuation. It is important for managers to understand when an FX rate may be incorrectly valued, as this situation may have a bearing on corporate decisions on strategy, risk management, capital structure, and overseas investments and operations. He also discusses the mechanics of forward FX contracts and their use in managing the risk of future foreign currency cash flow and includes a case that unifies the ideas. The case company is faced with FX exposure in the revenues from a proposed new foreign customer. The decision maker applies the text material to estimate whether the FX rate is over-, under-, or correctly valued. The final decisions are whether to expand sales to the foreign market and whether to hedge the FX risk.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Financial Markets","Forex"]},{"id":"9781119166061","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Introduction to Stochastic Differential Equations with Applications to Modelling in Biology and Finance","authors":["Carlos A.

Hassett, a corporate development executive, author and specialist in value management, mergers and acquisitions, new venture strategy, development, and execution for high technology, SaaS, web, and mobile businesses, the book convincingly demonstrates that the equity risk premium is proportional to long-term Treasury yields, establishing a connection to loss aversion theory.\n\nExplains stock prices from 1960 through the present including the 2008/09 \"market meltdown\"\n\nShows how the S&P 500 has consistently reverted to values predicted by the model\n\nSolves the equity premium puzzle by showing that it is consistent with findings on loss aversion\n\nDemonstrates that three factors drive valuation and stock price: earnings, long term growth, and interest rates\n\nUnderstanding the stock market is simple.

These markets are inextricably entwined with underlying monetary standards and consequently they are treated conjointly in this book. Four different foreign exchange rate regimes are analyzed including exchange rates under commodity money, fiduciary money, fiat money (with fixed exchange rates), and fiat money (with flexible exchange rates).\n\nFor more than eight decades, most countries have operated with fiat money. Proponents maintain that fiat money provides individual countries with much greater monetary autonomy. Yet both analytics and experience indicate that this is not always the case. Whether a country has more monetary autonomy depends on whether fiat money is paired with fixed or flexible exchange rates. Although flexible exchange rate regimes are not without their critics, it has become increasingly apparent that fiat money with flexible rates provides individual countries much greater monetary autonomy. This arrangement allows participants in foreign exchange markets greater latitude for adjusting to the wide variations in national monetary policies that are prevalent with fiat money.\n\nSeveral audiences may find this book beneficial: undergraduate students in economics and finance, students of international business, graduate students, students in executive programs who need to expand their knowledge of international finance, and practicing executives and managers—especially those who are employed by companies operating globally.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Financial Markets","Forex"]},{"id":"9781633696839","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Breaking Bad Habits","authors":["Freek Vermeulen"],"pages":"272","publication_date":"October 2018","description":"Could some \"best practices\" be…bad?\n\nHave you ever wondered why most newspapers are so large? Or why management consultants work such long hours? Or why hotels still insist on having check-in desks? Ask anyone in these industries, and their answer will be the same: \"That’s the way we’ve always done it.\"\n\n\"Best practices\" may be widespread, but that doesn't mean they're effective. In many instances the opposite is true: best practices can be outdated, harmful, and a hindrance to innovation. These bad practices are all too common in organizations, and managers and executives can be blind to their pernicious effects. Since they've worked in the past, or have been adopted with success by other firms, their purpose or effectiveness is rarely questioned. As a consequence, these practices spread and persist.\n\nIn Breaking Bad Habits, Freek Vermeulen, a strategist with a keen eye for the absurd, offers the tools to identify these practices and rid them from your organization. And, most of all, he presents a compelling case for how eliminating popular but outworn ideas, processes, and strategies can create new opportunities for innovation and growth.\n\nBrimming with examples of norm-defying organizations in an eclectic range of industries--including IVF clinics, hotels, newspapers, and a famous London theater--Breaking Bad Habits will make you rethink your long-held beliefs about industry norms while encouraging you to reinvigorate your business by breaking out of the status quo.","tags":["Design","Visual Design","Film & Video","Television Production"]},{"id":"9780470018798","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Credit Derivatives and Structured Credit: A Guide for Investors","authors":["Richard Bruyère"],"pages":"294","publication_date":"February 2006","description":"Over the past decade, credit derivatives have emerged as the key financial innovation in global capital markets.

Or it might be a model that shows with startling clarity that your new product development effort is a likely winner—or loser.

[It] can optimize, backtest, prove or disprove old theories, eliminate the bad ones and make the good ones better. Cybernetic Trading Strategies explores new ways to use the computer and finds ways to make a valuable machine even more valuable.\" --from the Foreword by John J. Murphy.\n\nUntil recently, the computer has been used almost exclusively as a charting and data-gathering tool. But as traders and analysts have quickly discovered, its capabilities are far more vast. Now, in this groundbreaking new book, Murray Ruggiero, a leading authority on cybernetic trading systems, unlocks their incredible potential and provides an in-depth look at the growing impact of advanced technologies on intermarket analysis. A unique resource, Cybernetic Trading Strategies provides specific instructions and applications on how to develop tradable market timing systems using neural networks, fuzzy logic, genetic algorithms, chaos theory, and machine induction methods.\n\nCurrently utilized by some of the most powerful financial institutions in the world--including John Deere and Fidelity Investments--today's advanced technologies go beyond subjective interpretations of market indicators to enhance traditional analysis. As a result, existing trading systems gain a competitive edge. Ruggiero reveals how \"incorporating elements of statistical analysis, spectral analysis, neural networks, genetic algorithms, fuzzy logic, and other high-tech concepts into a traditional technical trading system can greatly improve the performance of standard trading systems.\" For example: spectral analysis can be used to detect when a market is trending earlier than classical indicators such as ADX.\n\nDrawing on his extensive research on market analysis, Ruggiero provides an incisive overview of cyber-systems--systems that, when applied correctly, can increase trading returns by as much as 200% to 300%. The author covers a wide range of important topics, examining classical technical analysis methodologies and seasonal trading, as well as statistically based market prediction and the mechanization of subjective methods such as candlestick charts and the Elliott Wave. Precise explanations and dozens of real-world examples show you how to:\n\nIncorporate advanced technologies into classical technical analysis methodologies.\n\nIdentify which of these technologies have the most market applicability.\n\nBuild trading systems to maximize reliability and profitability based on your own risk/reward criteria.\n\nMost importantly, Cybernetic Trading Strategies takes you step by step through system testing and evaluation, a crucial step for controlling risk and managing money.\n\nWith up-to-date information from one of the field's leading authorities, Cybernetic Trading Strategies is the definitive guide to developing, implementing, and testing today's cutting-edge computer trading technologies.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Financial Markets","Technical Analysis"]},{"id":"9781118237564","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Hedge Fund Analysis: An In-Depth Guide to Evaluating Return Potential and Assessing Risks","authors":["Frank J.

Still, the firms we work for, admire and invest in seem to take costly reputation hits all too often. Everyone interested in managing, regulating or investing in public firms will find Nir Kossovsky's book a wonderful read through reputations won, lost and regained over the last 20 years. This is the first book which goes beyond platitudes to explain how to spot value destroying reputation risk and how to manage it or live with its consequences. Couldn't be more timely.\"\n\n—Tom Skwarek, Managing Director|Structuring and Solutions Group, Unicredit Bank AG; previously Managing Director|Corporate Strategic Solutions, Swiss Re.\n\n\"There are fiduciary reasons why corporate directors would benefit from reading this book. There is also a personal benefit. The collapse of a company's reputation can stain the personal reputation of its directors.\"\n\n—George Miles, Member of the Board of Directors, AIG, EQT, Harley Davidson, HFF, and Wesco.\n\n\"Nir Kossovsky has written a gripping tale, first educating the reader, by distinguishing between corporate branding and reputation, then alarming us with case histories of mismanagement of corporate reputational crises, and finally reassuring all with a unique solution, i.e. insuring against the risk of reputational loss.\"\n\n—John H. Bennett, Partner, Global Brand Positioning, previously Chief Marketing Officer, Visa, Inc.\n\n\"While directors know reputation is important, it often is treated as a vague 'good' until something bad happens. Nir Kossovsky does a great job, with many examples, of connecting reputation to stock price and to behaviors, before and after crises. If you are a director, a senior manager, or a regulator, you should read this book and remember the lessons it offers. There is no office which will restore reputation, but careful planning and quick response, as Nir points out, can make a big difference.\"\n\n—Herbert S. Winokur, Jr., former chairman on Enron's Board Finance Committee and a director of many for-profits and non-profits\n\nA company that takes a hit to its reputation—BP after the Gulf oil spill, Barclays after fiddling LIBOR, News Corp after the phone hacking scandal—enters a world of grief: market value falls along with employee morale, regulatory scrutiny increases, and customers defect and boycott. Reputation, Stock Price, and You: Why the Market Rewards Some Companies and Punishes Others shows how a company's reputation is created and how reputational value impacts corporate P&L and the personal finances of its many stakeholders. Better yet, it shows what you can do to profit from, increase, protect, monitor, evaluate, restore, and even insure reputational value.\n\nIf your job, bonus, options, salary, or investments depend on the stock price of a public company—or on the sales, profitability, or value of a private company—you need to read this book to understand the concrete steps you can take to improve your firm's reputation, reduce risks to its finances and industry standing, and reap the highest reputational dividends. Using dozens of case studies, Reputation, Stock Price, and You:\n\nExplains how stakeholders, and their expectations, both shape and are shaped by a company's reputation\n\nDescribes how reputations for ethics, innovation, governance, quality, safety, sustainability, and security are created and lost\n\nShows how you can influence the expectations and behaviors of stakeholders, which in turn can improve corporate finances, reduce operational risk, and increase stock price or market value\n\nProvides sensitive tools for tracking and predicting stock price as a function of reputational value metrics\n\nThe majority of directors at U.S. public companies now count reputation as their firm's #1 concern, and with good reason. A firm with a superior reputation gains many benefits: Customers are more willing to pay higher prices, vendors and employees offer better terms for their services, creditors and equity investors offer better terms for capital, and regulators tend to be more forgiving. This book shows how to achieve and sustain a stellar reputation and how to convert it into its tangible form: reputational value.\n\nWhat you'll learn\n\nHow stakeholder expectations for a company help shape a company's reputation\n\nHow actions taken by a company in managing ethics, innovation, governance, quality, safety, sustainability, and security shape stakeholder expectations\n\nHow a company's reputation affects stakeholder behavior\n\nHow corporate executives and directors have the unique opportunity to frame the entire reputation-forming process and build it into governance policies\n\nWhy professional marketing, and communications efforts play a relatively minor role in reputation formation\n\nHow the behavior of stakeholders collectively determine a company's stock price or market value\n\nHow to measure and improve your company's reputation and thus improve results in all areas\n\nWho this book is for\n\nReputation, Stock Price and You is for senior executives and mid-level managers, directors, and market analysts, fund managers, and sophisticated individual investors.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Corporate Valuation"]},{"id":"9781449688394","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"An Introduction to Digital Multimedia, 2nd Edition","authors":["T.M.

By designing this safety net into the contract, you’re free to take the time to examine records, meet with employees, and fully understand the legal issues at hand. If the target loses value during that time, in certain cases, you’re free to walk away. This book explores the full power of the Material Adverse Change clause, and today’s M&A in general. You’ll dig into the real causes of M&A failure, and discover the traits and practices that lead to poor results as you learn how to avoid these common mistakes and drive more successful deals. Recent case studies highlight common mistakes made—and propagated—by otherwise intelligent people, so you can identify and eliminate these practices within your own organization.\n\nA large acquisition is already a delicate balancing act. Why complicate it with the exponential risk by not doing your homework? This book shows you how to apply best practices to increase your chances of successful deals and avoid potentially career ending mistakes. \n\nExplore the true root causes of M&A failures of the past\nAnalyze the personality traits that drive suboptimal outcomes\nImplement new practices to avoid mistakes and close successful deals\nLearn why common-sense errors are repeated over and over again\nThe M&A market has grown to become a major factor in the global economy, yet many buyers do less investigation than consumers making everyday purchases. Material Adverse Change shows you how to slash risk and improve your chances of completing better deals.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Mergers and Acquisitions"]},{"id":"9781422170724","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"What I Didn't Learn in Business School","authors":["Jay Barney","Trish Gorman Clifford"],"pages":"272","publication_date":"October 2010","description":"Meet John Downs.

The Orphanage was created by three twenty-something visual effects veterans who wanted to make their own feature films and discovered they could do this by utilizing home computers, off the shelf software, and approaching things artistically. This guide details exactly how to do this: from planning and selecting the necessary cameras, software, and equipment, to creating specific special effects (including gunfire, Kung Fu fighting, car chases, dismemberment, and more) to editing and mixing sound and music. Its mantra is that the best, low-budget action moviemakers must visualize the end product first in order to reverse-engineer the least expensive way to get there.

Despite this, many central banks throughout the world have largely ignored balance sheet movements, and have instead focused on implementing interest rates.\n\nIn this book, Mustapha Abiodun Akinkunmi highlights the challenges and controversies faced by central banks in the past and present when implementing policies, and analyzes the links between these policies, the central bank balance sheet, and the consequences to economies as a whole.

Fortunately, it’s available—in the form of options. In Why Trade Options? top trader and options instructor Mark D. Wolfinger shows how options can be used conservatively, to systematically reduce risk and protect assets. Wolfinger explains the choices that options provide to cautious investors and explains the tradeoffs associated with each alternative. You’ll learn how to use “protective” (a.k.a. “married”) puts to buy complete protection at a higher price—and how to use covered calls to gain more modest protection, without paying a dime out of pocket. Wolfinger shows how to use simple “collars” to gain more protection at lower cost and helps you use options-based “stock replacement” strategies to lock in stock profits (while objectively considering the tax implications).

Markowitz devised the idea in 1952.\n\nIn the past six decades, Markowitz has risen to international acclaim as the father of Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), with his evaluation of the impact of asset risk, diversification, and correlation in the risk-return tradeoff. In defending the idea that portfolio risk was essential to strategic asset growth, he showed the world how to invest for the long-run in the face of any economy.\n\nIn Risk Return Analysis, this groundbreaking four-book series, the legendary economist and Nobel Laureate returns to revisit his masterpiece theory, discuss its developments, and prove its vitality in the ever-changing global economy.

The book posits integrated reporting as a key mechanism by which companies can ensure their own long-term sustainability by contributing to a sustainable society. Although integrated reporting has seen substantial development due to the support of companies, investors, and the initiatives of a number of NGOs, widespread regulatory intervention has yet to materialize. Outside of South Africa, adoption remains voluntary, accomplished via social movement abetted, to varying degrees, by market forces. In considering integrated reporting's current state of play, the authors provide guidance to ensure wider adoption of the practice and success of the movement, starting with how companies can improve their own reporting processes. But the support of investors, regulators, and NGOs is also important. All will benefit, as will society as a whole.\n\nReaders will learn how integrated reporting has evolved over the years, where frameworks and standards are today, and the practices that help ensure effective implementation—including, but not limited to an extensive discussion of information technology's role in reporting and the importance of corporate reporting websites. The authors introduce the concepts of an annual board of directors' \"Statement of Significant Audiences and Materiality\" and a \"Sustainable Value Matrix\" tool that translates the statement into management decisions. The book argues that the appropriate combination of market and regulatory forces to speed adoption will vary by country, concluding with four specific recommendations about what must be done to accelerate high quality adoption of integrated reporting around the world.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Mergers and Acquisitions"]},{"id":"9781119966050","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Credit Securitisations and Derivatives: Challenges for the Global Markets","authors":["Daniel Rösch","Harald Scheule"],"pages":"462","publication_date":"May 2013","description":"A comprehensive resource providing extensive coverage of the state of the art in credit secruritisations, derivatives, and risk management\n\nCredit Securitisations and Derivatives is a one-stop resource presenting the very latest thinking and developments in the field of credit risk.

Authers explains why a strong recovery remains far away, why the risk of a disastrous \"final\" crisis remains terrifyingly real, and how investors can best navigate today's brutally challenging markets. The European Financial Crisis reveals why the 2010/2011 market rallies were so fearful, and why their underlying assumptions -- continued Chinese growth, bailouts, progress towards bank solvency, more easy \"Fed\" money -- have proven so tenuous. Above all, Authers shows how the Eurozone crisis uncovers today's worst unaddressed risk: the markets' loss of confidence in governments. This brief discussion offers  insights into underlying flaws in the banking system and the Eurozone's structure that remain unaddressed; how cheap money and bailouts have bought time that is rapidly running out; and the increasingly frightening signs of \"perverse synchronization\": forex, equity, credit, and commodity markets massively moving in tandem.

Tim Johnson, Obama and Romney all kept dog-eared copies of Kevin Mellyn's Broken Markets on their nightstands. . . . Mellyn's work is a fascinating, important, and eminently good read and should inform the debate on overhauling the U.S. and global financial regulatory systems and sustainable macro fiscal and monetary policy.\"\n\n--Eric Grover, in his review of Broken Markets in The American Banker\n\nBroken Markets allows the intelligent non-specialist to understand and navigate the ongoing worldwide aftermath of the 2008 financial market meltdown. The key theme of the book is how the leading financial institutions and the political leadership of the U.S. and European Union have failed us and set the stage for continued market turmoil. It explains what this means for investors, borrowers, society in general, and the financial-services industry. Former banker Kevin Mellyn focuses on providing readers with clear and simple explanations of the forces at work and the potential consequences for their future prosperity.\n\nAs this book makes clear, what's coming is a world in which high structural unemployment and flat or declining real income is likely—not to mention a diminished retirement financial safety net. The book therefore provides actionable information for protecting wealth and making prudent investment decisions in an economy that is nothing like the one that has sustained us for decades.\n\nAs a forward-looking narrative about rapidly changing events and volatile markets and politics, Broken Markets will provide no single prediction about the future but rather describe alternative scenarios and provide the reader with signposts to watch out for in deciding which reality is actually unfolding. Unlike most books written by journalists on global finance, the scenarios and signposts described will be largely based on the lessons of financial and political history rather than breaking news. This book:\n\nTells you in plain language how today's financial system threatens your livelihood and wealth\n\nTells you why and how governments worldwide, with some notable exceptions, are taking actions likely to make things worse instead of better\n\nExplains how the leading financial institutions lost their way during the bubble years and how they can find the path back to prosperity and value to society\n\nTells you what life will be like in a \"post-finance\" economy and how you can protect your wealth\n\nWhat you'll learn\n\nAfter reading Broken Markets, you will:\n\nUnderstand how governments and financial leaders made poor decisions and the consequences in both the short and long term\n\n\"Connect the dots\" between seemingly unconnected market developments\n\nUnderstand how global finance really influences your livelihood\n\nEvaluate professional investment advice critically\n\nMake an independent, informed evaluation of competing economic and political policies\n\nDevelop a long-term financial game plan for a \"post-finance\" world\n\nImpress your friends and family with your financial savvy\n\nWho this book is for\n\nBroken Markets is for people who have savings and investments, watch the business news, read the Wall Street Journal or Financial Times at least occasionally, and just want to make sense of the post-2008 crisis world while taking steps to protect their hard-won wealth. It is not intended for financial professionals, though it will strike a chord there. Mostly it is for the sensible, educated man and woman looking for straight talk and clarity. It is also a good choice for students and young people just starting their careers since it teaches them things their teachers (and often their employers) never told them. Above all, it is a good choice for anyone who likes to be informed, provoked into re-examining beliefs and assumptions, and entertained by sharp-edged writing.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance"]},{"id":"9780240814995","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Portable Video, 6th Edition","authors":["Norman Medoff","Edward J.

Unfortunately, a confusing array of anecdotal and conflicting indicators often renders it impossible for managers and investors to see where the economy is heading in time to take corrective action. Now, a 35-year Wall Street veteran unveils a new forecasting method to help managers and investors understand and predict the economic cycles that control their businesses and financial fates. In Ahead of the Curve, Joseph H. Ellis argues that the problem with current forecasting models lies not in the data, but rather in the lack of a clear framework for putting the data in context and reading it correctly. The book explains critical economic indicators in nontechnical language, identifies and documents the recurring cause-and-effect relationships that consistently predict turning points in the economy, and provides the tools managers and investors need to position themselves ahead of cyclical upturns and downturns. Economic events are not as random and unpredictable as they seem. This book helps readers recognize and react to signs of change that their rivals don't seeand win a sizeable competitive advantage. Joseph H. Ellis was a partner at Goldman Sachs and was ranked for 18 consecutive years by Institutional Investor magazine as Wall Street's No.1 retail industry analyst.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Financial Markets","Trading Stocks"]},{"id":"9780240806051","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"File Interchange Handbook","authors":["Brad Gilmer"],"pages":"307","publication_date":"November 2012","description":"As the professional film and television industries move away from conventional media and toward computer-based technology, file formats have become a key enabling technology.

The ability to interchange text, audio, and visual communication over the Internet has fundamentally transformed the way news organizations operate. Convergence has enabled media companies to gather, disseminate, and share information over a variety of platforms. Throughout the history of journalism, it has been common for journalists to study one medium, such as traditional print or broadcast, and to anticipate a career working only in their chosen field. However, the 21st century journalist has fluidity to write and deliver news content in a variety of formats. (source: http://www.convergencejournalism.com/)\n\n\nBroadcast News Writing, Reporting, and Producing presents a solid foundation for any student learning how to become a broadcast journalist ? in today's world of convergent journalism, it is more important than ever that broadcast textbooks cover the most current trends in media. Convergent journalism (the coverage of news across multiple delivery platforms such as the internet, television, podcasts, ipods, blogs, etc) is here to stay ? broadcast journalism continues to morph as newer and more advanced content platforms are hatched and developed, and broadcast journalists must understand how to write, report, and produce for multiple platforms simultaneously. Just one crucial fact remains: students will need training on how to perform successfully in a world in which current events aren't just shown on the ten o'clock evening news.\n\nBroadcast News Writing, Reporting, and Producing will be completely overhauled to reflect the trends of convergent journalism on every page. New co-author Frank Barnas brings a multi-faceted perspective of writing, reporting, and producing that allows for multi-platform delivery systems, and shows students with real-world examples the functions and practices of today's media. The new edition will be rewritten and restructured to accommodate common 16-week course modules, and will be divided into four major sections of the news: gathering, writing, reporting, and producing. Sidebars featuring how examples used in the text relate to convergence in journalism help students to draw connections easily between current stories and trends in the industry.\n\nThe comprehensive approach of this text brings a multi-faceted perspective of writing, reporting, and producing that is needed more than ever in today's world of convergent journalism. This newest edition is being completely overhauled by the experienced journalist Frank Barnas. New photos and illustrations, a restructuring of the text, expanded end-of-chapter exercises, newer and more relevant examples, and more information on producing all contribute to giving readers what they need most: a nuanced understanding of how the media of today function in a world without news boundaries.","tags":["Design","Visual Design","Film & Video","Television Production"]},{"id":"0672329298","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Red Hat Fedora Core 6 Unleashed","authors":["Andrew Hudson","Paul Hudson"],"pages":"1128","publication_date":"December 2006","description":"Red Hat® Fedora™ Core 6 Unleashed presents comprehensive coverage of Fedora Core 6, the popular Linux distribution developed by the Red Hat-sponsored Fedora Project.\n\nThis book provides detailed information on installing, using, and administering Fedora.

This has been motivated by the desire to establish the problems of control law synthesis and full state estimation in numerical terms.\n\nIn recent years, a general approach based on multiple LTI models (linear or affine) around various function points has been proposed. This so-called multiple model approach is a convex polytopic representation, which can be obtained either directly from a nonlinear mathematical model, through mathematical transformation or through linearization around various function points.\n\nThis book concentrates on the analysis of the stability and synthesis of control laws and observations for multiple models. The authors' approach is essentially based on Lyapunov's second method and LMI formulation. Uncertain multiple models with unknown inputs are studied and quadratic and non-quadratic Lyapunov functions are also considered.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","FinTech"]},{"id":"9780240808284","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Filmmakers and Financing, 5th Edition","authors":["Louise Levison"],"pages":"272","publication_date":"November 2006","description":"The first, most crucial step in making a film is finding the funds to do it.

Gerdes"],"pages":"152","publication_date":"February 2017","description":"Let's learn about money! Money is a market phenomenon. It originated as a spontaneous social institution, and its use is still inextricably tied to market exchange. Therefore, the analysis of money occurs in a market setting. Use of monetary systems and a market setting as the underlying parameters ideally positions the reader to examine money in its various uses: as a medium of exchange, in credit markets, and as an instrument of monetary policy. Professor Gerdes believes that the study of money should commence at the most general level. Consequently, this book is anchored in the context of monetary systems (commodity, fiduciary, and fiat monies). This gives readers a very broad perspective-helping readers understand, for example, how the money used today differs from money used in the past, or how current money relates to money discovered by anthropologists in isolated subcultures. This book is perfect for courses in traditional money and banking courses, as well as undergraduate courses in monetary theory as well as sourcebook on money for business professionals.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Banking"]},{"id":"9780132808460","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Investing Strategies for Alternative Global Markets (Collection)","authors":["Scott Phillips","Vishaal B.

With billions of dollars at stake, and the nation's economic future on the line, Newbridge Capital sought to become the first foreign firm in history to take control of one of Korea’s most beloved financial institutions.\n\nIn a proud country still reeling from a humiliating International Monetary Fund bailout in the Asian Financial Crisis, Newbridge Capital had to muster every ounce of skill, determination, and patience to bring the deal to closing.\n\nShan takes readers inside the battle to win control of the bank—a delicate, often exasperating process that meant balancing the goals of Newbridge with those of the government, bank employees, and Korea's powerful industrial titans.\n\nFinally, the author describes how Newbridge transformed and rebuilt the struggling bank into a shining example of modern banking—as well as a massively profitable investment.

There were searing questions about how the crisis was allowed to happen and calls for immediate reform from Capital Hill, the news media, and the general public. Multiple scandals sent real fear through the investing community and brought unprecedented heat on the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). There was little doubt that the SEC had to fix rules that permitted bad behavior, shake off decades of complacency and enforce existing laws.\n\nWall Street lawyer Norm Champ spent nearly 20 years dealing with the SEC on behalf of his clients and as an industry representative working to educate the agency about hedge funds. Believing he could help reform the deeply-flawed agency, Champ left his career in the private sector and joined the SEC. As Director of the Division of Investment Management, he became a key player in stabilizing trillions of dollars of investor capital while reenergizing the SEC’s culture and management.\n\nIn Going Public, Champ presents a rare, insider’s look at how the SEC operates and explains exactly how the agency impacts the overall economic health of the country. He examines the inner workings of hedge funds, economic policy and politics, investing, and inefficient and frustrating federal agencies. Engrossing and important, this book offers critical recommendations for policy changes that will create healthy, free-functioning markets and help Americans better prepare for the inevitable next crisis.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance"]},{"id":"9780273747079","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Investing Against the Tide","authors":["Anthony Bolton"],"pages":"179","publication_date":"December 2012","description":"Anthony Bolton is Britain’s best-known and longest-serving fund manager.

Throughout, we consider the balance between enriching a page with motion design while avoiding unnecessary flourishes\n\nReaders will learn how to design loading sequences that ensure users stay fully engaged instead of tuning out, how to leverage simple physics principles to make apps respond naturally to users’ input (just like motion behaves in the real world), how to exploit CSS transforms to create rich depth in animations, and how to fully leverage JavaScript animation libraries like Velocity.js to streamline animation programming. From animation performance to theory, we cover everything needed to become a professional web animator.

Drawing on many of the strengths of both OCaml and .NET, it's a general–purpose language ideal for real–world development. F# integrates functional, imperative, and object–oriented programming styles so you can flexibly and elegantly solve programming problems, and brings .NET development alive with interactive execution. Whatever your background, you'll find that F# is easy to learn, fun to use, and extraordinarily powerful. F# will help change the way you think about and go about programming.\n\nWritten by F#’s designer and two active contributors, Expert F# is the authoritative, comprehensive, and in–depth guide to the language and its use. Designed to help others become experts, the book gives a thorough introduction to the F# language from quick essentials to in–depth advanced topics such as active pattern matching, aggregate data types and operators, sequence expressions, lazy values, mutable data and side–effects, generics, type augmentations, functional decomposition and code organization.\n\nThe second half of the book is devoted to examining the practical application of F#, providing elegant solutions to common programming tasks including user interface implementation, data access, web and distributed programming, symbolic and numerical computations, concurrent programming, testing, profiling, and interoperability with other languages. The latest hot developments in F# and .NET are also addressed, including Active Patterns, implicit class construction, integration with LINQ over relational data, meta programming and useful tips for working with Visual Studio and F# command–line tools.\n\nThe worlds foremost experts in F# show you how to program in F# the way they do!\n\nWhat you'll learn\n\nHow to use F# for functional, imperative, and object–oriented programming\n\nHow to code elegant F# solutions with expert technique and style\n\nHow to develop Windows, web, graphics, and database applications in F#\n\nHow to do numerical, concurrent, lexical, and symbolic processing in F#\n\nHow to interoperate with C and COM\n\nWho this book is for\n\nThis book is for anyone interested in state–of–the art .NET programming.

It explains the background to the new discussion on hedge fund replication and how to derive the returns of many hedge fund strategies at much lower cost, it differentiates the various underlying approaches and explains how hedge fund replication can improve your own investment process into hedge funds.\n\nWritten by the well known Hedge Fund expert and author Lars Jaeger, the book is divided into three sections: Hedge Fund Background, Return Sources, and Replication Techniques. Section one provides a short course in what hedge funds actually are and how they operate, arming the reader with the background knowledge required for the rest of the book. Section two illuminates the sources from which hedge funds derive their returns and shows that the majority of hedge fund returns derive from systematic risk exposure rather than manager \"Alpha\". Section three presents various approaches to replicating hedge fund returns by presenting the first and second generation of hedge fund replication products, points out the pitfalls and strengths of the various approaches and illustrates the mathematical concepts that underlie them.\n\nWith hedge fund replication going mainstream, this book provides clear guidance on the topic to maximise returns.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance"]},{"id":"9780133065411","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Adobe® Premiere® Pro Studio Techniques","authors":["Jeff I.

Based on litigation cases from international stock markets, and borrowing multidisciplinary findings in the fields of finance, economics, accounting, media studies, criminology, legal studies, psychology, and medicine, this book is the first to provide thorough micro-level regulatory proposals rooted in financial reality. By focusing on securities trading, they apply antitrust measures to limiting monopolistic power that is used for the manipulation of investors' perception and monopolistic profit. These proposals are quantifiable, adjustable, inexpensive, and can be easily implemented by any securities regulating agency for real-time oversight and daily operations.\n\nThe recommendations found here are intended to improve the fairness and transparency of the financial markets, thereby perfecting the market competition, protecting investors, stabilizing the market, and preventing crises\n\nExplores how avoiding crises can to contribute to a more scientific, health aware, and civilized economic and social development\n\nWritten by a team of authors who have extensive experience in this dynamic field, including Nobel Laureate Lawrence R. Klein\n\nSince the founding of the first, organized stock exchange in Amsterdam 400 years ago, no systematic economic research results on stock markets have been implemented in stock market regulation around the world. Regulating Competition in Stock Markets aims to fill this void.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Financial Markets","Trading Stocks"]},{"id":"9781606498750","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Working Ethically in Finance","authors":["Anthony Asher"],"pages":"204","publication_date":"July 2015","description":"“… a must read for those wanting to craft a vocation in finance.” -- Adrian Gore, CEO, Discovery Group; “… no better book for a student or practitioner who wants more than is usually on offer in finance courses in our universities.” -- Paul Oslington, Professor of Economics and Dean of Business, Alphacrucis College, Sydney. To develop a vocation we ask: what do I want to be remembered for? This involves aspiring to personal integrity and a life well lived. Those working in the financial sector fulfill vocations by finding ways to serve social purposes, to allocate resources efficiently and to provide financial security—while remembering the needy. This means contributing to institutions, where people can flourish personally and create appropriate products and services. The ethics of those working on finding their vocation do not flow from rules and obligations, but from a personal commitment to seeking what is good. This life is based on the fundamental personal virtue, integrity. This book is written for those who aspire to the cultivation of the personal virtues of wisdom, self-control, courage, and justice.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance"]},{"id":"9781628256246","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Incentivizing Collaborative BIM-Enabled Projects: A Synthesis of Agency and Behavioral Approaches","authors":["Chen-Yu Chang"],"pages":"197","publication_date":"October 2018","description":"The use of digital representations to aid in projects—Building Information Modeling (BIM)—is gaining traction worldwide as an effective and beneficial approach to executing projects that can reduce errors and improve project results. These crucial benefits are prompting many businesses and governments to mandate its use, while others search for ways to grow and incentivize the practice.\n\nIn Incentivizing Collaborative BIM-Enabled Projects: A Synthesis of Agency and Behavioral Approaches, Chen-Yu Chang, PhD, explains the current state of BIM use in three distinct countries: China, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Following multiple case studies in each country, Professor Chang explores the explicit and implicit motivators that may drive BIM participation and the factors that can influence its effectiveness.\n\nThe case studies offer multiple perspectives on why and how BIM-enabled projects are adopted and provide a lens for understanding BIM at varying levels of maturity and in different environments. Understanding the motivators behind the current state of BIM-enabled projects facilitates the design of incentive structures for future BIM projects.\n\nAs BIM continues to evolve and transform the industry, this research provides valuable insight into the best practices for incentivizing its use. This theoretical approach gives researchers and organizations new tools and ideas to help build their own strategies to encourage BIM use and better understand its place in managing projects.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Mergers and Acquisitions"]},{"id":"9780133435085","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Visual QuickStart Guide: Adobe Premiere Pro CC","authors":["Jan Ozer"],"pages":"464","publication_date":"June 2013","description":"In this clear and straightforward guide, digital video veteran Jan Ozer gives beginning and intermediate video editors just what they need to know on Adobe Premiere Pro CC.

The process of syndication is a form of investment alliance that generates networks of VC firms and start-up companies. Despite the prominent role played by syndicates, extant entrepreneurship literature found contradicting evidence on the relationship between the practice of syndication and the performance of both the start-up and the investors. In fact, our understanding of the circumstances under which syndicates have the potential to boost performance, rather than hamper them, is still limited. This book intends to fill this gap and explore the performance dynamics surrounding networks in the venture capital industry. The text also provides introductory knowledge to those interested in network studies and methods.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Financial Markets","Securities"]},{"id":"9780240804743","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Animation in the Home Digital Studio","authors":["Steven Subotnick"],"pages":"240","publication_date":"November 2012","description":"So you want to create animation!

If properly designed and regulated, these \"good derivatives\" can open vast possibilities to address a variety of global problems. Filled with provocative ideas, fascinating stories, and valuable lessons, it will provide both an insightful interpretation of the last forty years in capital and environmental markets and a vision of world finance for the next forty years.\n\nAs a young economist at the Chicago Board of Trade, Richard Sandor helped create interest rate futures, a development that revolutionized worldwide finance. Later, he pioneered the use of emissions trading to reduce acid rain, one of the most successful environmental programs ever. He will provide unique insights into the process of creating these new financial products. Covering successes and failures, the story describes the tireless process of inventing, educating and creating support for these new inventions in places like Chicago, New York, London, Paris and how it is unfolding today in Mumbai, Shanghai and Beijing.\n\nThe book will tell the story of the creation of the Chicago Climate Exchange and its affiliated exchanges (European Climate Exchange, Chicago Climate Futures Exchange and Tianjin Climate Exchange, located in China). The lessons learned in these markets can play a critical role in effectively addressing global climate change and other pressing environmental issues. The author argues that market-based trading systems are a far more effective means of reducing pollutants than \"command-and-control\". Environmental markets may ultimately help to find solutions to issues such as rainforest destruction, water problems and biodiversity threats.\n\nWritten in an engaging, narrative style, Good Derivatives will be of interest to both practitioners and general readers who want to better understand the creative process of financial innovation. In the middle of so much distrust of markets, it is also a recipe of how transparent, well-regulated markets can be a force for good in the environmental, health, and social areas.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance"]},{"id":"9780240810454","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Produce Your Own Damn Movie!","authors":["Lloyd Kaufman"],"pages":"304","publication_date":"September 2012","description":"Often low-budget filmmakers get thrown into the position of being not only the director, but their own producer.

Beyond the photos and commentary by Jarvis, there are pithy musings by a select handful of subjects on the topics of art, food, community, region, culture, and film. In addition, many of the subjects share their favorite things, places, and doings in and around the Seattle that they have explored, discovered, and rediscovered time and again.

The most recent wave, the 5th takeover wave of the 1990s, was characterized by an unprecedented number of corporate restructurings in terms of mergers and acquisitions (M&As), public-to-private transactions, spin-offs and divestitures, and leveraged recapitalizations. Following the collapse of the stock market in March 2000, M&A activity slumped dramatically, but this pause ended in the second half of 2004 when takeover deals occurred again quite frequently. Indeed, some observers wonder whether the 6th takeover wave has started. The takeover wave in the 1990s was particularly remarkable in terms of size and geographical dispersion. For the first time, Continental European firms were as eager to participate as their US and UK counterparts, and M&A activity in Europe hit levels similar to those experienced in the US. Due to its financial impact and the unprecedented activity in Continental Europe, the 5th takeover wave of the 1990s and recent takeover activity (in biotech, utilities, pharmaceuticals) have triggered a great deal of interesting academic research. This volume brings together a selection of insightful papers. An impressive group of international authors address the following themes: takeover regulation; the cyclical pattern of the M&A markets and probable causes and effects; methods to determine the performance of success of M&A actions; cross border deals; means of payment and its effects; studies of hostile bids; high leverage takeovers and delistings.*A selection of the best and latest quantitative research on M&A activity worldwide*Impressive collection of international authors*Provides important insights and implications for practitioners","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Mergers and Acquisitions"]},{"id":"9780132478748","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Investment Opportunities in Emerging Markets","authors":["Scott Phillips"],"pages":"9","publication_date":"July 2010","description":"This Element is an excerpt from Buying at the Point of Maximum Pessimism: Six Value Investing Trends from China to Oil to Agriculture (9780137038497), by Scott Phillips.

Presented as a series of striking case studies, this book explores certain enigmatic or philosophical puzzles in the finance industry; some of these puzzles may seem slightly absurd at first glance, but all are very relevant to the way finance is conducted in the real world. Each story highlights specific hypocrisies or moral dilemmas that lie at the heart of the system, guiding readers through the challenges of finance by way of innovative and memorable paradigms. Written in clear, accessible language, this book doesn't claim to offer original financial theory or philosophy as such, but instead deepens the reader's understanding of the system and stimulates independent consideration of the current state of affairs.\n\nThe financial world, so often viewed as a rather dull place, is secretly alive with possibilities of strange and sometimes wonderful conundrums. There is the possibility, for instance, of a Manhattan auction house selling derivatives to buy swift-swimming predators known as Megalodons (thought to be extinct for millions of years). This book explores this and other curious propositions to point out the paradoxes of finance.\n\nExplore the meaning of \"value\" in different contexts\nLearn what the Old Testament can teach us about risk and uncertainty\nExamine an alternative take on the 2007/2008 credit crisis\nConsider how the \"financial innovation\" trend impacts the industry\n\nTo truly understand something, it is necessary to crawl deep into the metaphorical underbelly and have a look around.

Johnson"],"pages":"488","publication_date":"November 2001","description":"'Shareholder Value' presents a powerful and useful toolkit of market-based perspectives, analytic approaches, valuation techniques, and specific financial metrics for use in everyday business life. The author helps a broad spectrum of professionals understand the salient points and real world implications of a 'value management' movement which has taken hold in many corporations in the United States and around the world. This movement is being supported by some of the major institutional investors who influence financial markets.The main goal of 'Shareholder Value' is to help working professionals grasp the concept of value 'creators' and 'destroyers', along with the implications. He also provides tools to measure the success (or failure) of major strategic and operational initiatives and enables corporate managers to understand how shareholder value is created, and then directs behaviour toward 'value-based' planning and action.Although mainly aimed at the professional market, 'Shareholder Value' will also be of use to students of business and finance as it is intended to provide a comprehensive foundation for important elements of business strategy and acquisition valuation, corporate financial analysis, capital investments, corporate financing and economic value based metrics.AUTHOR'S REVIEW:When developing this book, I strived to achieve the following:* Provide the finance professional and student of finance with a comprehensive template of shareholder value concepts and techniques - geared toward use in a corporate setting.* Give the non-financial professional an understanding of the underpinnings and behavioural aspects of economic value management.* Outline and provide details of an effective process for implementing a value-based financial performance system within a corporation.* ...And, combine learning with enjoyable reading by presenting technical material through a story.The \"story\" and \"characters\" are unique features of Shareholder Value - A Business Experience. The reader can get an appreciation of the environment surrounding value-based management, along with challenges that arise when transitioning from traditional \"accounting\" performance (where earnings and earnings per share reign supreme) to \"economic\" performance (where cash flow and return on investment are emphasized). Characters occupying operating and staff roles have been created to represent people that those working inside companies (large, medium and small) may encounter and, also, to invoke some humour. Insights into how to function in different corporate roles can be gained by following the characters through the story.Presents a combination of analysis and case study in which a strong technical treatment is blended with a fictional case study to offer clarity and explanationA practical and effective implementation process for a comprehensive financial performance systemOffers a perspective of the role of different corporate and business unit functions in the implementation of value-based financial performance within a company","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Corporate Valuation"]},{"id":"9780137280957","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Adobe Premiere Pro Classroom in a Book (2021 release)","authors":["Maxim Jago"],"pages":"480","publication_date":"April 2021","description":"The fastest, easiest, most comprehensive way to learn Adobe Premiere Pro\n\nClassroom in a Book®, the best-selling series of hands-on software training workbooks, offers what no other book or training program does -- an official training series from Adobe, developed with the support of Adobe product experts.\n\nAdobe Premiere Pro Classroom in a Book (2021 release) contains 17 lessons that cover the basics and beyond, providing countless tips and techniques to help you become more productive with the program.

TV is moving through a period of rapid change. Governments around the world are switching from analogue to digital forms of transmission to further expand the amount of content that TV signals can carry. At the same time, competition for eyeballs has also grown from outside that traditional marketplace with the emergence of the Internet. The roll-out of broadband and increased bandwidth has had the greatest impact on television because online technology can readily convey the same content. All these changes have created a great deal more competition for viewers within the traditional TV marketplace. The Internet has proven to be especially popular with young people who have adopted its applications to a far greater extent than their elders, though even the latter have now begun to take up online activities in significant numbers. Are these audiences the same? Do people make a choice between these two media or do they use them both at different times and for different reasons? Can television utilise the Internet in profitable ways to enhance its market position? Will television have to evolve from its current state to provide the kinds of content reception services to which people have become accustomed in the online world? If it does need to change to survive, will this nevertheless mean a radical new configuration of content and the disappearance of ‘channels’ with fixed, pre-determined programme schedules?\nExamines the implications of new interactive communications technologies for the way people will use television in the future\nPresents an analysis of changing styles of television viewing and changing orientations towards television\nExamines the growing importance of the broadband internet as a source of information and entertainment","tags":["Design","Visual Design","Film & Video","Television Production"]},{"id":"9780132467025","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Investment Tools You Can Use","authors":["Tom Lydon"],"pages":"10","publication_date":"February 2010","description":"This Element is an excerpt from The ETF Trend Following Playbook: Profiting from Trends in Bull or Bear Markets with Exchange Traded Funds (ISBN: 9780137029013) by Tom Lydon.

The measure was humungous in scale and led to a sharp contraction in money supply for a short period. Although demonetization’s proponents have contended that it would cleanse the economy of black money and make transactions more formal and digital, its implementation certainly could have been better. The effects of demonetization on the Indian economy are debatable and will vary by sector. Its effectiveness will be talked about and studied by economists and policy makers for decades to come.\n\nDemonetization has made only a minor dent in the GDP. It has helped to bring more people into the tax net and has reduced the size of the informal economy. With the increased use of digital payments, economic transactions become recorded.

But is Africa ready for this fight? Do the antifraud practitioners possess strategies to equip Africa for this fight?

The leadership and citizens of these countries are aware of the effects of fraud and corruption, but lack the strategies and sometimes the resources to prevent, deter, detect, investigate, or resolve fraud and corruption incidences. This is compounded by huge deficits in compliance because laws are either ignored or deliberately contravened, and regulations and ethical practices are circumvented.

Author Al Brooks has done just that. By simplifying his trading system and trading only 5-minute price charts he's found a way to capture profits regardless of market direction or economic climate. His first book, Reading Price Charts Bar by Bar, offered an informative examination of his system, but it didn't allow him to get into the real nuts and bolts of the approach. Now, with this new series of books, Brooks takes you step by step through the entire process.\n\nBy breaking down his trading system into its simplest pieces: institutional piggybacking or trend trading, trading ranges, and transitions or reversals (the focus of this book), this three book series offers access to Brooks' successful methodology.

Counterparty credit risk has become the key element of financial risk management, highlighted by the bankruptcy of the investment bank Lehman Brothers and failure of other high profile institutions such as Bear Sterns, AIG, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The sudden realisation of extensive counterparty risks has severely compromised the health of global financial markets. Counterparty risk is now a key problem for all financial institutions.\n\nThis book explains the emergence of counterparty risk during the recent credit crisis. The quantification of firm-wide credit exposure for trading desks and businesses is discussed alongside risk mitigation methods such as netting and collateral management (margining). Banks and other financial institutions have been recently developing their capabilities for pricing counterparty risk and these elements are considered in detail via a characterisation of credit value adjustment (CVA). The implications of an institution valuing their own default via debt value adjustment (DVA) are also considered at length. Hedging aspects, together with the associated instruments such as credit defaults swaps (CDSs) and contingent CDS (CCDS) are described in full.\n\nA key feature of the credit crisis has been the realisation of wrong-way risks illustrated by the failure of monoline insurance companies. Wrong-way counterparty risks are addressed in detail in relation to interest rate, foreign exchange, commodity and, in particular, credit derivative products. Portfolio counterparty risk is covered, together with the regulatory aspects as defined by the Basel II capital requirements. The management of counterparty risk within an institution is also discussed in detail. Finally, the design and benefits of central clearing, a recent development to attempt to control the rapid growth of counterparty risk, is considered.\n\nThis book is unique in being practically focused but also covering the more technical aspects.

Kimberly","Hamid Bouchikhi"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"October 2012","description":"Planning for post-merger integration typically focuses on operational issues, such as harmonizing product lines and financial and human resource information systems, and determining which employees are retained and which ones are let go. Attention is also paid to the identity of the merged enterprise in a superficial sense. The name of the acquirer may be retained, or a new logo may be created or a new name found.\n\nBut for organizations to achieve the psychological synergies required to realize economic synergies from mergers and acquisitions, the authors argue that executives need to attend to a more complex, deeper set of identity issues. These issues define the essence of the entity and give employees a clear answer to the question “Who are we?” and external stakeholders a clear answer to the question “Who are they?” The first question refers to an organization’s members’ view of what makes it unique among all other organizations. The second question captures what external audiences believe is the essence of the organization. Left unattended, these deeper identity issues will diminish engagement and will inevitably affect the performance of the merged entity.\n\nOperational integration post-merger is a necessary but not sufficient condition for successful performance. Careful attention to identity integration is also essential for success. The authors argue that there is no “one best way” and that in fact there are four distinct paths that can be followed to achieve identity integration: assimilation, federation, confederation and metamorphosis. Each of these paths represents a particular combination of the answers to two questions that managers must confront in anticipation of a merger or acquisition: What should be done with the identities that the parties to the merger bring with them (in other words, their historical identities)? And how should a common identity for the future be built?","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Mergers and Acquisitions"]},{"id":"9781398616332","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Fintech Regulation In Practice","authors":["Maha El Dimachki"],"pages":"320","publication_date":"August 2024","description":"Harness regulation to your advantage and tackle its challenges with this practical guide for fintechs, financial services firms and other key players within the fintech ecosystem.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","FinTech"]},{"id":"9780240521602","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Timing for Animation, 2nd Edition","authors":["Tom Sito"],"pages":"192","publication_date":"April 2013","description":"The classic work on animation principles, now fully updated for the digital age.","tags":["Design","Visual Design","Film & Video","Animation"]},{"id":"9781118998656","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"The Forex Trading Course: A Self-Study Guide to Becoming a Successful Currency Trader, 2nd Edition","authors":["Abe Cofnas"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"July 2015","description":"EXPERT, DEPENDABLE FOREX COACHING—UPDATED TO KEEP YOU AHEAD IN AN EVOLVING MARKET\n\nThe Forex Trading Course is the systematic guide aspiring traders need to enter the market with the confidence and skills necessary to generate wealth.

They have shown remarkable uncorrelated performance and in the great bear market of 2008 they had record gains. These traders are highly secretive about their proprietary trading algorithms and often employ top PhDs in their research teams. Yet, it is possible to replicate their trading performance with relatively simplistic models. These traders are trend following cross asset futures managers, also known as CTAs. Many books are written about them but none explain their strategies in such detail as to enable the reader to emulate their success and create their own trend following trading business, until now.\n\nFollowing the Trend explains why most hopefuls fail by focusing on the wrong things, such as buy and sell rules, and teaches the truly important parts of trend following. Trading everything from the Nasdaq index and T-bills to currency crosses, platinum and lean hogs, there are large gains to be made regardless of the state of the economy or stock markets. By analysing year by year trend following performance and attribution the reader will be able to build a deep understanding of what it is like to trade futures in large scale and where the real problems and opportunities lay.\n\nWritten by experienced hedge fund manager Andreas Clenow, this book provides a comprehensive insight into the strategies behind the booming trend following futures industry from the perspective of a market participant. The strategies behind the success of this industry are explained in great detail, including complete trading rules and instructions for how to replicate the performance of successful hedge funds.

When setting up a shot, the camera operator can employ a range of visual techniques that will clearly communicate the idea to an audience. Composition is the bedrock of the operator's craft, yet is seldom taught in training courses in the belief that it is an intuitive, personal skill. Peter Ward shows how composition can be learned, to enhance the quality of your work.\n\nBased on the author's own practical experience, the book deals with the methods available for resolving practical production questions such as:\n\nDoes the shot composition accurately reflect the idea that initiated the shot?\nWill the content and method of presenting the subject accurately convey the idea?\n\nMajor innovations in television and film production since the previous edition have affected the styles of composition, such as wide-screen and the use of mini DV cameras. These new technologies and their implications for picture composition are addressed in this new edition. A new colour plate section is also being included to update the section on colour.\n\nIf you are a practising camera operator, trainee camera operator, student or lecturer on a television or film production course, or simply a video enthusiast wishing to progress to a more professional standard you will find this book essential in enhancing the quality of your work.","tags":["Design","Visual Design","Film & Video"]},{"id":"9781800562790","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Fedora 31 Essentials","authors":["Neil Smyth"],"pages":"271","publication_date":"April 2020","description":"Fedora 31 Essentials is your comprehensive guide to mastering Fedora 31, offering detailed instructions on installation, system administration, and deployment.

Its new visual approach makes quantitative finance accessible to a broad audience, including those without strong backgrounds in math or finance. Michael Lovelady introduces a simplified but powerful technique for calculating profit probabilities and graphically representing the outcomes. Lovelady's \"pictures\" highlight key characteristics of structured securities such as the increased likelihood of profits, the level of virtual dividends being generated, and market risk exposures. After explaining his visual approach, he applies it to one of today's hottest investing trends: lower-volatility, higher-income strategies. Because of today's intense interest in alternative investments and structured securities, this book reviews their unique advantages to investors, managers and advisors of retail and institutional portfolios. Visual Quantitative Finance focuses on key topics directly related to the design, pricing and communication of structured securities, including stochastic price projections and the framework underlying options pricing formulas. The key is Lovelady's explicit use of probabilities in a spreadsheet format. By working directly with the underlying assumptions, he transforms the Black-Scholes framework into five columns of a simple Excel spreadsheet, with no complicated formulas—making structured securities far more intuitive to design, evaluate and manage.\n\nFor all investors, students, and financial professionals who are interested in quantitative finance, risk measurement, options pricing, structured securities, or financial model building - and for everyone who needs to explain these topics to someone else. For those with quantitative backgrounds, this guide offers powerful new tools for design and risk management, simplifying the design and evaluation of innovative instruments. For everyone else, Lovelady makes the subject comprehensible for the first time.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance"]},{"id":"9781119794332","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"The 5 Mistakes Every Investor Makes and How to Avoid Them, 2nd Edition","authors":["Peter Mallouk"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"June 2021","description":"This book, from New York Times best-selling author Peter Mallouk, will help you avoid the mistakes that stand in the way of investment success!\n\nA reliable resource for investors who want to make more informed choices, this book steers readers away from past investment errors and guides them in the right direction.

Kirkpatrick II, the world’s most influential technical analyst\n\nThere’s only one way to successfully compete with Wall Street’s “big boys”: use algorithmic systems, just like they do. Fortunately, you can. Thanks to the wide availability of derivatives, cheap computing, and low-cost, high-speed trading platforms, you can run algorithmic systems that are proven statistically and can operate almost automatically.\n\nIn this book, world-renowned technical analysis expert Charles D. Kirkpatrick II presents these systems and the evidence that supports them. Building on exhaustive research, Kirkpatrick shows why relative strength systems deliver consistent profits. Next, he drills down to identify the optimal elements of such systems, including lookback periods, ranks/ratios for portfolio changes, minimum trading volumes, and techniques for limiting the impact of market declines.\n\nKirkpatrick’s final results are practical and robust. Based on easy-to-interpret ADX, forward line, and 3-bar reversal charts, they are easy enough for virtually any investor to use, with any size portfolio.\n\nAt its foundation, technical analysis involves recognizing and analyzing trends and identifying the best investment strategy to take advantage of them. Most traders and investors who look for trends do so by analyzing a long list of charts on a continuing basis. In Kirkpatrick's Investment and Trading Strategies, world-renowned technical analysis researcher Charles D. Kirkpatrick II presents tested, pinpoint approaches to stock investing that are far more effective and efficient.\n\nDrawing on statistical testing of markets from 1990 to the present, Kirkpatrick identifies combinations of technical tests that have consistently delivered the best performance. Using them, he shows how to identify stocks that are now demonstrating the strongest relative and absolute strength. Next, he identifies specific trend following indicators most likely to identify the first signs of trend reversals--and, thus, the right time to sell.\n\nThroughout, Kirkpatrick offers detailed, practical, and example-rich guidance for using these indicators, providing all the detail you need to implement an investment strategy that is both profitable and risk-averse.\n\nTested, trend-based indicators you can understand and rely onChoose the right stocks--and the right times to buy and sell them\n\nProtect your capital with DMI, ADX, and other key technical indicatorsDiscover your true risk of loss and systematically protect against it\n\nWhy Kirkpatrick’s relative strength system works so wellUnderstand the statistics behind the system--in as much detail as you’d like\n\nUsing the system after you’ve implemented itRealistic examples and step-by-step instructions","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Financial Markets","Technical Analysis"]},{"id":"9780470915240","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Financial Valuation: Applications and Models, + Website, 3rd Edition","authors":["James R.

Coverage includes a historical perspective on the business models of the three major waves of private equity leading to today's 4.0 model, a detailed analysis of the industry today, as well as reflections on the future of private equity and prospective futures. It also provides readers with the analytical and financial tools to analyze a fund's performance, with clear explanations of the mechanisms, organizations, and individuals that make the system work.\n\nThe authors demystify private equity by providing a balanced, but critical, review of its contributions and shortcomings and moving beyond the simplistic journalistic descriptions. Its ecosystem is complex and not recognizing that complexity leads to inappropriate judgments. Because of its assumed opacity and some historical deviant (and generally transient) practices, it has often been accused of evil intents, making it an ideal scapegoat in times of economic crisis, prodding leading politicians and regulators to intervene and demand changes in practices. Unfortunately, such actors were often responding to public calls for action rather than a thorough understanding of the factors at play in this complex interdependent system, doing often more harm than good in the process and depriving economies of one of their most dynamic and creative forces. Self-regulation has clearly shown its limits, but righteous political interventions even more so.\n\nPrivate equity investment can be a valuable addition to many portfolios, but investors need a clear understanding of the forces at work before committing to this asset class. With detailed explanations and expert insights, Private Equity 4.0 is a comprehensive guide to the industry ways and means that enables the reader to capture its richness and sustainability.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Corporate Valuation"]},{"id":"9781119906803","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"DeFi For Dummies","authors":["Seoyoung Kim"],"pages":"336","publication_date":"December 2022","description":"Get to know the building blocks of a new economy\n\nThe promise of decentralized finance (DeFi for those up on their financial lingo) as a disruptor to financial institutions makes it must-know for anyone involved in finance.

FABOZZI","VINOD KOTHARI"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"July 2008","description":"Introduction to Securitization outlines the basics of securitization, addressing applications for this technology to mortgages, collateralized debt obligations, future flows, credit cards, and auto loans. The authors present a comprehensive overview of the topic based on the experience they have gathered through years of interaction with practitioners and graduate students around the world. The authors offer coverage of such key topics as: structuring agency MBS deals and nonagency deals, credit enhancements and sizing, using interest rate derivatives in securitization transactions, asset classes securitized, operational risk factors, implications for financial markets, and applying securitization technology to CDOs. Finally, in the appendices, the authors provide an essential introduction to credit derivatives, an explanation of the methodology for the valuation of MBS/ABS, and the estimation of interest rate risk.\n\nSecuritization is a financial technique that pools assets together and, in effect, turns them into a tradable security. The end result of a securitization transaction is that a corporation can obtain proceeds by selling assets and not borrowing funds. In real life, many securitization structures are quite complex and enigmatic for practitioners, investors, and finance students. Typically, books detailing this topic are either too lengthy, too technical, or too superficial in their presentation. Introduction to Securitization is the first to offer essential information on this topic at a fundamental, yet comprehensive level-providing readers with a working understanding of what has become one of today's most important areas of finance.\n\nAuthors Frank Fabozzi and Vinod Kothari, internationally recognized experts in the field, clearly define securitization, contrast it with corporate finance, and explain its advantages. They carefully illustrate the structuring of asset-backed securities (ABS) transactions, including agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) deals and nonagency deals, and show the use of credit enhancements and interest rate derivatives in such transactions. They review the collateral classes in ABS, such as retail loans, credit cards, and future flows, and discuss ongoing funding vehicles such as asset-backed commercial paper conduits and other structured vehicles. And they explain the different types of collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and structured credit, detailing their structuring and analysis. To complement the discussion, an introduction to credit derivatives is also provided.\n\nThe authors conclude with a close look at securitization's impact on the financial markets and the economy, with a review of the now well-documented problems of the securitization of one asset class: subprime mortgages. While questions about the contribution of securitization have been tainted by the subprime mortgage crisis, it remains an important process for corporations, municipalities, and government entities seeking funding. The significance of this financial innovation is that it has been an important form of raising capital for corporations and government entities throughout the world, as well as a vehicle for risk management. Introduction to Securitization offers practitioners and students a simple and comprehensive entry into the interesting world of securitization and structured credit.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance"]},{"id":"9780273755203","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"The Money Myth","authors":["Alexander Davidson"],"pages":"272","publication_date":"December 2011","description":"Financial markets use persuasion, propaganda and salesmanship to survive.

As a result, many traders are seeking better ways to profit from their bets on shifting volatility. Once, the primary way to trade volatility was to buy and sell standard calls and puts. Then, the world discovered VIX, the so-called “Fear Index.” Next, the CBOE devised ways to trade the VIX: first VIX futures, and then VIX options. Unfortunately, not everyone can trade futures; hence, the latest of innovations derived from ETFs are volatility-based Exchange Traded Notes (ETNs): first VXX, then VXZ, and now more than two dozen additional competitors. These debt instruments can be excellent trading and hedging vehicles, but they don’t perfectly track the VIX. As a result, it’s tricky to use them reliably, and many traders who’ve experimented with them have suffered significant losses. In Trading Volatility ETFs, Adam Warner explains the structures of VXX and VXZ, reveals how they’ve worked in the past, and projects their behavior in different market environments. He systematically demystifies their subtleties, explains who should and shouldn’t use them, and describes how they can best be applied in effective hedging and trading.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Financial Markets","Trading Stocks"]},{"id":"9781351334549","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"The Business of Film, 2nd Edition","authors":["Paula Landry"],"pages":"334","publication_date":"June 2018","description":"The updated second edition of this text introduces readers to the business of film at every stage of the filmmaking lifecycle, from planning and production to distribution.

In particular over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives were blamed by many for partially causing and catalysing the crisis. Not surprisingly, this has led to dramatic action from politicians, policymakers and regulators in relation to OTC derivative markets. Two of the most important changes are the mandatory clearing of standardised OTC derivatives and the requirements for bilateral margin posting in non-standard OTC contracts. Both clearing and margining mandates will be effectively phased in from 2014 and the associated costs will be severe. These regulatory changes are therefore going to create a dramatic shift in the topology of financial markets, together with a significant reallocation of counterparty and systemic risks. Knowledge of the subject is an important consideration for all financial institutions whether they are CCP members, clear trades indirectly or find themselves subject to bilateral margin requirements.\n\nCentral Counterparties: Mandatory Clearing and Bilateral Margin Requirements for OTC Derivatives explains the central clearing of OTC derivatives and the associated bilateral margin requirements. The book provides a historical perspective of central clearing as it developed with derivative exchanges in order to mitigate counterparty credit risk. The regulatory requirements (Dodd-Frank, EMIR, Basel III) being imposed since the global financial crisis are defined and discussed. The mechanics of central clearing are described including operational aspects, initial margin and default fund calculations, loss waterfalls and allocation methods. Client clearing is discussed, in particular giving detail on margin segregation and portability methods. An assessment is made throughout of the advantages and disadvantages of clearing and margining requirements, including potential issues such as funding liquidity risk, operational risk and wrong-way risk.\n\nThe book is unique and covers the regulatory requirements together with the practical implementation details and the potential impacts and consequences. It is an invaluable and complete reference guide for any market practitioner, policy maker, academic or student with responsibility or interest in the area of OTC derivatives.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance"]},{"id":"9780240813431","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Write Your Way into Animation and Games","authors":["Christy Marx"],"pages":"418","publication_date":"November 2012","description":"Launch your career in writing for video games or animation with the best tips, tricks, and tutorials from the Focal press catalog--all at your fingertips.

As a result, financial analysts are able to establish different valuations of a company, according to these two financing methods. Valuation of the Liability Structure by Real Options explains how the real options method works in conjunction with traditional methods. This innovative approach is particularly suited to the valuation of companies in industries where an underlying asset has high volatility (such as the mining or oil industries) or where research and development costs are high (for example, the pharmaceutical industry).

Now it's shaking things up again as editor Walter Murch, director Anthony Minghella, and a long list of Hollywood heavy-hitters are proving that this under-$1,000 software can (and should) be used to edit a multi-million dollar motion picture! This book tells the story of that endeavor: the decision to use Final Cut Pro, the relationship between the technology and art (and craft) of movie-making, how Final Cut Pro was set up and configured for Cold Mountain, how the software's use affected the work flow, and its implications for the future of filmmaking. More than anything, however, this is Murch's own story of what seemed to many a crazy endeavor-- told through photos, journal entries, email musings, and anecdotes that give readers an inside view of what the film editor does and how this particular film progressed through post-production. The book includes, in his own words, Murch's vision, approach, and thoughts on storytelling as he shapes Cold Mountain under the intense pressures of completing a major studio film.\n\nWith Academy Awards for his work on Apocalypse Now and The English Patient, sound and film editor Walter Murch is one of the few universally acknowledged editing masters in cinema.

They expand the scope of the typical bank management course by addressing all types of deposit-type financial institutions and by explaining the why of intermediation rather than simply describing institutions, regulations, and market phenomena. This analytic approach strikes at the heart of financial intermediation by explaining why financial intermediaries exist and what they do. Specific regulations, economies, and policies will change, but the underlying philosophical foundations remain the same. This approach enables students to understand the foundational principles and to apply them to whatever context they encounter as professionals.\"This book is the perfect liasion between the microeconomics realm of information economics and the real world of banking and financial intermediation. It supplies a healthy dose of microeconomic theory to fully understand the underlying features of the most common financial instruments used in modern banking practice, all explained thoroughly with down to earth narratives and doable math/game theoretic instruments.

The author engages readers with an insightful and brief claim:  \"Values are more than numbers.\"  He then provides support for just how important human capital is to the value creation paradox.  He doesn't stop there because ideas without definitive actions don't promote transformation.  He further challenges the reader with:  \"If you don't think outside of the box, you're doomed to live in the box.\"A user-friendly manual chock full of vignettes, suggestions and pithy commentary EVE is a must read for owners, officers, boards and advisors to derive understanding of business value drivers.  This book teaches the reader how to conduct more intangible asset due diligence as well as what decisions and behaviors impact value. With more effective methods of risk identification, measurement, management, and mitigation (\"IMMM\"), trusted advisors and owners can establish a \"working on the business\" strategy to prioritize issues impacting a company's intangible assets – assets which almost inevitably create the largest component of value in flourishing companies. This focus also serves to reduce risk while leveraging human capital and operational effectiveness. This book challenges users of value enhancement and valuation services to demand greater intellectual rigor to best serve owners/investors of the United States' economic engine—the midmarket company. Therefore, readers are challenged to look beyond the common metrics and numbers.  They are admonished to rely less on formulaic approaches and on software that can generate spurious opinions. The reader is called to action by the author, a US Marine Combat Officer veteran, to lead the change: \"You burn the boats if you want to be sure you succeed taking the island.\"Trillions of dollars of private equity are changing hands as Baby Boomer owners and investors seek greater liquidity and legacies while investors seek higher returns from direct investment in private companies. This book provides risk and human capital guidance removing some of the guesswork on valuation and value creation.  •         Provide better evidence of value & equity discounts•         Identify and quantify risk and provide tools to manage it•         Inform better business management and investment decisions•         Create a more comprehensive valuation for equity investments•         Roadmap and strategy for enhancement of going concern valueGovernance, Risk and Compliance (\"GRC\") management are hot topics in today's economic environment. The familiar financial metrics may not be providing adequate indications of value creation – the core principle of most shareholder investment expectation. To identify risk and work with it effectively, practitioners need an in-depth understanding of the forces at play. Equity Value Enhancement is a detailed, insightful guide for making better equity decisions. Finally, the author puts his passion front and center by offering the reader the opportunity to invest in the human capital this book addresses by encouraging support of military veteran's with combat PTSD so they may be productive citizens with the leadership and business skills provided by our country's \"Greatest Generation.\"","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Corporate Valuation"]},{"id":"9780470885048","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Credit Derivative Strategies: New Thinking on Managing Risk and Return","authors":["Rohan Douglas"],"pages":"240","publication_date":"July 2007","description":"Written by professionals for professionals, \"Credit Derivative Strategies\" is an in-depth, comprehensive guide to investing with credit derivatives.

But nobody noticed.\n\nOn the morning of August 6th 2007, investment professionals were baffled with unprecedented stock patterns. Mining sector stocks were up +18% but manufacturing stocks were down -14%. It was an extreme sector skew yet the S&P index was unchanged at +0.5% on the day. The next few days would continue with excessive volatility. MBI Insurance, a stock that had rarely attracted speculation would finish up +15% on Aug 6th, followed by another +7% on Aug 7th, and then finish down -22% over the subsequent two days. The brief rally in MBI was short lived.\n\nOnly weeks later would investors begin to have insights on the dispersion patterns. Prominent hedge funds that had never had a negative annual performance began disclosing excessive trading loses with many notable firms reporting several hundred millions were lost  - in a single day. Hedge funds were hemorrhaging in excess of 30% of their assets when the S&P index was unchanged.  The market dispersion was the side effects of the synchronous unwind ignited by the hordes of \"computerized\" strategies that were caught off guard when history didn't repeat. It was the industry's first world wide panic - by machines.\n\nOver the past decade, computerized (or black-box) trading has had a coming of age. Black-box firms use mathematical formulas to buy and sell stocks. The industry attracts the likes of mathematicians, astrophysics and robot scientists. They describe their investment strategy as a marriage of economics and science. Their proliferation has been on the back of success, black-box firms have been among the best performing funds over the past decade, the marquee firms have generated double-digit performance with few if any months of negative returns.\n\nThrough their coming of age, these obscure mathematicians have joined the ranks of traditional buy-n-hold investors in their influence of market valuations. A rally into the market close is just as likely the byproduct of a technical signal as an earnings revision. They are speculated to represent a one third of all market volume albeit their influence to the day-to-day gyrations goes largely unnoticed. CNBC rarely comments on the sentiments of computerized investors.\n\nConventional wisdom suggests that markets are efficient, random walks and that stock prices rise and fall with the fundamentals of the company. How then have black-box traders prospered and how do they exploit market inefficiencies? Are their strategies on their last legs or will they adapt to the new landscape amidst the global financial crisis?\n\nChasing the Same Signals is a unique chronicle of the black-box industry's rise to prominence and their influence on the market place. This is not a story about what signals they chase, but rather a story on how they chase and compete for the same signals.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Financial Markets","Trading Stocks"]},{"id":"9780134476315","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Principles of Managerial Finance, 15th Edition","authors":["Scott B.

These markets are inextricably entwined with underlying monetary standards and consequently they are treated conjointly in this book. Four different foreign exchange rate regimes are analyzed including exchange rates under commodity money, fiduciary money, fiat money (with fixed exchange rates), and fiat money (with flexible exchange rates). For more than eight decades, most ountries have operated with fiat money. Proponents maintain that fiat money provides individual countries with much greater monetary autonomy. Yet both analytics and experience indicate that this is not always the case. Whether a country has more monetary autonomy depends on whether fiat money is paired with fixed or flexible exchange rates. Although flexible exchange rate regimes are not without their critics, it has become increasingly apparent that fiat money with flexible rates provides individual countries much greater monetary autonomy. This arrangement allows participants in foreign exchange markets greater latitude for adjusting to the wide variations in national monetary policies that are prevalent with fiat money. Several audiences may find this book beneficial: undergraduate students in economics and finance, students of inter­national business, graduate students, students in executive programs who need to expand their knowledge of international finance, and practicing executives and managers— especially those who are employed by companies operating globally.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Financial Markets","Forex"]},{"id":"9781317309604","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Producing for Profit","authors":["Andrew Stevens"],"pages":"348","publication_date":"June 2016","description":"In Producing for Profit: A Practical Guide to Making Independent and Studio Films, Andrew Stevens provides real-world examples and his own proven techniques for success that can turn passion into profit.

Traditionally technology buyers, they are learning to embed technology in their products and become technology vendors. In turn, if you analyze Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook, Twitter and eBay, you marvel at their data centers, retail stores, application ecosystems, global supply chains, design shops. They are considered \"consumer\" tech but have better technology at larger scale than most enterprises. The old delineation of technology buyer and vendor is obsolete.

For non-Korean-speaking viewers, subtitles are crucial to the experience. Enter Viki Inc., a company that hosts content for streaming and provides subtitles and closed captions. Viki both eliminates language barriers and introduces the content to an otherwise unserved audience.\n\nTraditionally, subtitles are created by a bilingual translator hired by the producer or broadcaster. But the process is expensive and slow to scale. To overcome these challenges, Viki developed a business model leveraging a community of more than 150,000 volunteers. This model allows Viki to crowdsource subtitles for Asian content in numerous languages. Viki rewards volunteers with gamified badges, the ability to view videos not otherwise available in their region, early access to new shows, and an advertising-free, high-definition experience of the content.\n\nThe combination of rapidly increasing internet video adoption rates and a greater appetite for foreign content — both in Asia and globally — has become a big opportunity for Viki, which was acquired by Tokyo-based Rakuten Inc. for a reported price of $200 million in 2013.\n\nThe authors argue that Viki's story exemplifies a larger trend playing out in Asia. They see Viki as an archetype of a new generation of companies leveraging business model innovation to drive growth in Asia. But to understand this type of business model innovation in its proper context, it's important to understand Viki's forerunners. The authors describe two distinct, yet overlapping, waves of business innovation from emerging markets in Asia in recent years: one decades old and still going, and another that is newer and includes companies like Viki.\n\nThe first wave primarily exploited differences in labor and other input costs between developed and developing markets. By contrast, the second wave is driven primarily by business model innovation and typically leverages new technology. These companies are characterized by extensive and often radical reconfigurations of the profit formula, resources, processes, and relationships within a broader stakeholder ecosystem. They may have a global orientation from the start.\n\nEstablished companies, the authors argue, can also embrace the opportunity for business model innovation. The authors cite examples such as Medtronic Inc. and MetLife Inc., which have both been experimenting with new business models in Asia. The authors also offer suggestions for how established companies can start to explore business model innovation.","tags":["Design","Visual Design","Film & Video"]},{"id":"067232847X","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Red Hat Fedora 5 Unleashed","authors":["Andrew Hudson","Paul Hudson"],"pages":"1104","publication_date":"May 2006","description":"Continuing with the tradition of offering the best and most comprehensive coverage of Red Hat Linux on the market, Red Hat Fedora 5 Unleashed includes new and additional material based on the latest release of Red Hat's Fedora Core Linux distribution.

The ability to interchange text, audio, and visual communication over the Internet has fundamentally transformed the way news organizations operate. Convergence has enabled media companies to gather, disseminate, and share information over a variety of platforms. Throughout the history of journalism, it has been common for journalists to study one medium, such as traditional print or broadcast, and to anticipate a career working only in their chosen field. However, the 21st century journalist has fluidity to write and deliver news content in a variety of formats. (source: http://www.convergencejournalism.com/)\n\n\nBroadcast News Writing, Reporting, and Producing presents a solid foundation for any student learning how to become a broadcast journalist ? in today's world of convergent journalism, it is more important than ever that broadcast textbooks cover the most current trends in media. Convergent journalism (the coverage of news across multiple delivery platforms such as the internet, television, podcasts, ipods, blogs, etc) is here to stay ? broadcast journalism continues to morph as newer and more advanced content platforms are hatched and developed, and broadcast journalists must understand how to write, report, and produce for multiple platforms simultaneously. Just one crucial fact remains: students will need training on how to perform successfully in a world in which current events aren't just shown on the ten o'clock evening news.\n\nBroadcast News Writing, Reporting, and Producing will be completely overhauled to reflect the trends of convergent journalism on every page. New co-author Frank Barnas brings a multi-faceted perspective of writing, reporting, and producing that allows for multi-platform delivery systems, and shows students with real-world examples the functions and practices of today's media. The new edition will be rewritten and restructured to accommodate common 16-week course modules, and will be divided into four major sections of the news: gathering, writing, reporting, and producing. Sidebars featuring how examples used in the text relate to convergence in journalism help students to draw connections easily between current stories and trends in the industry.\n\nThe comprehensive approach of this text brings a multi-faceted perspective of writing, reporting, and producing that is needed more than ever in today's world of convergent journalism. This newest edition is being completely overhauled by the experienced journalist Frank Barnas. New photos and illustrations, a restructuring of the text, expanded end-of-chapter exercises, newer and more relevant examples, and more information on producing all contribute to giving readers what they need most: a nuanced understanding of how the media of today function in a world without news boundaries.","tags":["Design","Visual Design","Film & Video","Television Production"]},{"id":"9781317364030","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Screen Adaptation: Beyond the Basics","authors":["Eric R.

When the entire regime is compromised, simply slapping bandages on each new wound will do nothing to cure the underlying disease.\n\nReinventing Financial Regulation goes beyond an urgent call to fix our profoundly troubled and damaged financial markets. It is a blueprint for an effective financial regulation system that could very well save the future of finance.\n\nWhat would a well-regulated financial system look like? Until now, policymakers, financial experts, and leading academics have been content to avoid facing this question head–on. We have been offered piecemeal reforms that ultimately leave the global financial system exposed to different versions of the same risks that so recently brought it to its knees. The world economy literally cannot afford to dodge this question any longer.\n\nPersaud's goal to bring clarity and a powerful simplicity to the financial regulation process results in a systematic and apolitical framework for fixing the world's fractured financial industry and transforming its regulation—not just for today's financial climate, but once and for all.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance"]},{"id":"9781951527952","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Mastering the Moneyed Mind, Volume II","authors":["Dr. Christopher Bayer"],"pages":"146","publication_date":"September 2020","description":"The book is an exploration of how direct and indirect psychological conditioning eliminates morality from decision making in the world of finance.\n\nThe Bottomless Line—Important Lessons They Did Not Teach You in Business School is the second book in a series about the psychology of money by Dr. Christopher A. Bayer, the Wall Street Psychologist. This book builds on the key concepts in the first volume, to draw the reader’s attention to the “dark side” of the business world. Structured in a way that enables readers to examine contemporary examples of willful co-optation, misuse, and misinterpretation of old texts and ideas, run-of-the-mill corruption, and dangerous groupthink, the author examines the personal and broad- scale financial troubles generated by reckless financial misunderstandings.\n\nThe book is an exploration of how direct and indirect psychological conditioning eliminates morality from decision making in the world of finance. It provides evidence that ties systemic corruption on Wall Street to the lessons of the storied Milgram experiments (obedience, effects of perceived hierarchy and status, immoral actions—“just following orders”). In the end, readers are led to the “big takeaway”: the need to cultivate and maintain a core of character in order to weather any ethical storm.\n\nIt also summarizes the history of financial psychopathy, details the rise and fall of a few notorious Wall Street perpetrators—from the brass at Enron to the infamous Bernard Madoff—and examines how their hardwired psychopathy leaves them bereft of moral qualities necessary to build a functioning and responsive moral compass of Gyroscope.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance"]},{"id":"9780240516783","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Video Editing with Avid: Media Composer, Symphony, Xpress","authors":["Roger Shufflebottom"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"July 2013","description":"This is the first comprehensive guide to editing on Avid from a PAL standpoint, also including NTSC information where appropriate, making this book a worldwide manual.\n\nIf you are already using Media Composer, Symphony, or Xpress and want to improve and consolidate your basic methods, or if you need to learn these systems from scratch, then this book is for you.

Bloomberg News reporter Yalman Onaran, supported by former U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. chief Sheila Bair - who provides a foreword and numerous interviews - urge that insolvent banks both small and too big to fail be allowed to do precisely that. Reading bank balance sheets is not everyone's idea of a good time. But Mr. Onaran, with support from Ms. Bair, does the chore and explains what it means. Mr. Onaran shows that the process of rescuing dead and dying banks is increasing systemic risk in the global banking system. And that is really more frightening than scream flicks from Tinseltown.\" -- Financial Post\n\nZombie banking has become standard operating procedure for big debtor nations. They prop up failing institutions, print money, and avoid financial corrections. But in an attempt to prolong the inevitable, bigger problems are created. The approach used now has not, and will not, work. This timely book reveals why. Zombie Banks tells the story of how debtor nations and failing institutions are damaging the long-term prospects of the global economy.\n\nAuthor Yalman Onaran, a veteran Bloomberg News reporter and financial banking sector expert, examines exactly what a zombie bank is and why they are kept alive. He also discusses how they hurt economic recovery and what needs to be done in order to restore stability. Along the way, Onaran takes an honest look at how we arrived at this point and details the harsh realities that must be faced, and the serious steps that must be taken, in order to get things headed in the right direction.\n\nPuts insolvent banks and debtor nations in the spotlight and examines how they are crippling the global economy\n\nOn the record sources include Paul Volcker, Joseph Stiglitz, Sheila Bair, and many more bank executives, regulators, politicians, and policymakers in the United States and abroad\n\nTakes the complexity of the current situation and translates it in a way that makes it understandable\n\nWhile the short-term measures taken to stave off depression and rejuvenate economic growth may offer hope, they are unsustainable over the long term.

But the point is, you are greedy, you want every little bit of money that you can possibly get because, like I say, that is how you are judged, that is your performance metric\"—Tom Hayes, 2013\n\nIn the midst of the financial crisis, Tom Hayes and his network of traders and brokers from Wall Street's leading firms set to work engineering the biggest financial conspiracy ever seen. As the rest of the world burned, they came together on secret chat rooms and late night phone calls to hatch an audacious plan to rig Libor, the 'world's most important number' and the basis for $350 trillion of securities from mortgages to loans to derivatives. Without the persistence of a rag-tag team of investigators from the U.S., they would have got away with it....\n\nThe Fix by award-winning Bloomberg journalists Liam Vaughan and Gavin Finch, is the inside story of the Libor scandal, told through the journey of the man at the centre of it: a young, scruffy, socially awkward misfit from England whose genius for math and obsessive personality made him a trading phenomenon, but ultimately paved the way for his own downfall.\n\nBased on hundreds of interviews, and unprecedented access to the traders and brokers involved, and the investigators who caught up with them, The Fix provides a rare look into the dark heart of global finance at the start of the 21st Century.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Mergers and Acquisitions"]},{"id":"9780240804552","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Digital Compositing for Film and Video","authors":["Steve Wright"],"pages":"336","publication_date":"December 2001","description":"Digital Compositing for Film and Video is a hands-on, practical, how-to guide that addresses the problems and difficult choices faced by the professional compositor in real-life situations. It presents techniques, tricks, and solutions for dealing with badly shot elements, coloration artifacts, and mismatched lighting that bedevil actual compositors working on real shots. Readers are offered in-depth practical methods for matte extraction, despill procedures, compositing operations, and color correction--the \"meat and potatoes\" of all digital effects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompositing is the artistic blending of several disparate elements from a variety of sources into a single image while making all the component elements appear to be in the same light space and shot with the same camera. When confronted with a bad composite any observer will recognize that something is wrong--the artist will know what is causing the problem, and the technician will know how to fix it. A good compositor must be both an artist and a technician.\n\nWritten by a senior compositor with over ten years' experience in both feature film and broadcast television, this book offers a broad range of alternative solutions that will save hours of fiddling with composites trying to get them to look right when the basic tools aren't working.

The Flash Crash of May 6, 2010–when the DJIA plummeted 734 points in 17 minutes, and dozens of top companies traded as low as zero–was just a harbinger of disasters to come. In Crap Shoot Investing, Barron’s Washington Editor Jim McTague reveals the twin causes of this massive transformation: high-frequency traders using mathematical hocus pocus, and blundering regulators whose attempts to promote long-term investment have massively backfired. McTague takes you through the Flash Crash moment by moment, revealing what happened and how it happened. Next, he burrows “under the volcano” to uncover the titanic, uncontrolled forces now at work in equity markets, showing investors exactly what they’re jumping into when they buy and sell stock today. You’ll learn how new exchanges, desperate for cash, are attracting high-frequency traders at everyone else’s expense… how “dark pools” of hidden trades are tilting the playing field…how even small investors are promoting dangerous volatility. McTague explains why regulators continue to ignore the big picture as the markets accelerate towards chaos. Last but not least, he presents a rational strategy for investors who need to get ahead in markets that have become riskier than most casinos.\n\n\"A valuable read for anyone considering investing in equity markets.\"\n\nReprinted with permission from CHOICE http://www.cro2.org, copyright by the American Library Association.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Financial Markets","Trading Stocks"]},{"id":"9781317367758","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"The Editor's Toolkit","authors":["Chris Wadsworth"],"pages":"266","publication_date":"January 2016","description":"The Editor's Toolkit: A Hands-On Guide to the Craft of Film and TV Editing is a tutorial-based introduction to the craft of editing.

In China's Superbank, Bloomberg authors Michael Forsythe and Henry Sanderson outline how the bank is at the center of China's domestic economic growth and how it is helping to expand China's influence in strategically important overseas markets.\n\n100 percent owned by the Chinese government, the CDB holds the key to understanding the inner workings of China's state-led economic development model, and its most glaring flaws. The bank is at the center of the country's efforts to build a world-class network of highways, railroads, and power grids, pioneering a lending scheme to local governments that threatens to spawn trillions of yuan in bad loans. It is doling out credit lines by the billions to Chinese solar and wind power makers, threatening to bury global competitors with a flood of cheap products. Another $45 billion in credit has been given to the country's two biggest telecom equipment makers who are using the money to win contracts around the globe, helping fulfill the goal of China's leaders for its leading companies to \"go global.\"\n\nBringing the story of China Development Bank to life by crisscrossing China to investigate the quality of its loans, China's Superbank travels the globe, from Africa, where its China-Africa fund is displacing Western lenders in a battle for influence, to the oil fields of Venezuela.\n\nOffers a fascinating insight into the China Development Bank (CDB), the driver of China's rapid economic development\n\nTravels the globe to show how the CDB is helping Chinese businesses \"go global\"\n\nWritten by two respected reporters at Bloomberg News\n\nAs China's influence continues to grow around the world, many people are asking how far it will extend. China's Superbank addresses these vital questions, looking at the institution at the heart of this growth.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance"]},{"id":"9780132467889","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"The Basics of How Technical Analysis Works for Investors","authors":["Michael N.

Consequently, the book is anchored in the context of monetary systems (commodity, fiduciary, and fiat monies).The intent is to give the student of money a very broad perspective. It allows the reader to understand, for example, how the money we use today differs from money used in the past, or how our current money relates to money discovered by anthropologists in isolated subcultures. Money is a market phenomenon. It originated as a spontaneous social institution, and its use is still inextricably tied to market exchange. Therefore, the analysis of money occurs in a market setting. Use of monetary systems and a market setting as the underlying parameters ideally positions the reader to examine money in its various uses: as foreign exchange, in credit markets, and as an instrument of monetary policy. The material in the book is suited for upper-division college students and business professionals with an interest in reaching an understanding of money.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Banking"]},{"id":"9780321549853","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Final Cut Pro 6: Visual QuickPro Guide","authors":["Lisa Brenneis"],"pages":"720","publication_date":"October 2007","description":"Newly updated for Final Cut Pro 6, this Visual QuickPro Guide is hands-down one of the most sought out books on Apple’s non-linear editing system.

Columbia University's Don Sexton fully identifies the real drivers of shareholder value, unifying key concepts from marketing, branding, economics, management, finance, accounting, and statistics. Sexton introduces a powerful new metric: Customer Value Added (CVA), the difference between customer-perceived value and variable cost per unit. Next, he demonstrates CVA at work, presents research and case studies that prove its value, and shows how to use it to consistently measure, manage, and optimize profit, cash flow, and shareholder value. Readers will learn why CVA works; how to measure it; how changes in CVA correlate to changes in profits and cash flow; and how to use CVA to steer the enterprise. Along the way, Sexton illuminates CVA's key implications for managers, including why managers must focus attention simultaneously on both customers and costs, and why well-publicized \"generic strategies\" such as \"net recommend\" offer only part of the solution.

Vine enables users to shoot short (six-second max) looping videos on their mobile phones and then share those videos with online friends. Vine videos (called vines) can be viewed from a user’s Vine or Twitter feed, shared via Facebook, or embedded in web pages and blogs. This makes Vine like a video version of Instagram, enabling users to “share life in motion” via social networking.\n\nThis has made Vine enormously popular, especially among the same younger users who made Instagram a hit. Just three months after its release, Vine has become the #1 free app in Apple’s U.S. App Store, and is used on 2.66% of all iOS devices  — more than any other video app. In addition, 2.8% of Twitter users are also Vine users . These numbers puts Vine’s userbase at somewhere between 4 to 6 million users, who upload more than 2,000 new videos each hour. There is no user manual for Vine, nor much in the way of online help files. Anyone wanting to get on the Vine bandwagon can use some help not just learning the basic shooting and sharing features, but also figuring out how to create more sophisticated types of vines.\n\nSams Teach Yourself Vine in 10 Minutes is a one-stop shop for everything associated with Vine, from shooting basic videos to sharing those videos socially to creating more sophisticated and artistic videos.

Across the globe, people are choosing the companies in their lives in the same way they choose the guests they invite into their homes. They are demanding that companies be “good company.”Proof is in the numbers. The authors created the Good Company Index to take a systematic look at Fortune 100 companies' records as employers, sellers, and stewards of society and the planet. The results were clear: worthiness pays off. Companies in the same industry with higher scores on the index—that is, companies that have behaved better—outperformed their peers in the stock market. And this is not some academic exercise: the authors have used principles of the index at their own investment firm to deliver market-beating results.Using a host of real-world examples, Bassi and company explain each aspect of corporate worthiness and describe how you can assess other companies with which you do business as a consumer, investor, or employee. This detailed guide will help you determine who the good guys are—those companies that are worthy of your time, your loyalty, and your money.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Corporate Valuation"]},{"id":"0735712824","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"The Flash Animator","authors":["Sandro Corsaro"],"pages":"240","publication_date":"June 2002","description":"Intrigued by digital animation?

One of the fastest-growing niches is, without a doubt, Islamic finance. Indeed, sustainable finance needs constantly evolving innovations, and this book offers valuable insights into Islamic capital structure and Shari’ah equity screening enriching academic discourse.\n\n\"In recent years, we have witnessed the emergence of a new generation of academics and professionals specializing in various aspects of Islamic finance as knowledge and practice. This has brought about a new dynamism and also further sophistication. This book is one of such contributions, as it develops knowledge which is then transformed into practice whereby practical impact is also achieved. Being an academic book, it provokes readers’ thoughts, offering a critique of the implications of the currently applied Shari’ah screenings methodologies. As a transformative practical piece, by developing an innovative screening ratio, in this book, Dr. Yildirim extends his focus on the risk-sharing based financing hierarchy, covers thoughts and the underlying philosophy, and proposes an Islamic version of a pecking order hierarchy. This framework can be considered the foundation for developing an Islamic capital structure theory. This book will benefit academics, professionals, investors, as well as policymakers working in the Islamic finance industry and would like to explore more.\" (Professor Dr. Mehmet Asutay, Durham University Business School, UK)\n\n\"This book offers, for the first time after the inception of Shari’ah screening methodologies, a groundbreaking new stock screening solution that is comprehensible, practical, and foremost entirely derived from the primary sources of Islam (Qur’an and Sunnah). Congratulations to Dr. Ramazan for his outstanding contribution to Islamic finance and capital markets.\" (Associate Professor Dr. Ahcene Lahsasna)\n\n\"This excellent book is a must-have for all corporate finance students/researchers interested in the theoretical aspect of capital structure and the religious discussion of Shari’ah equity screening.
