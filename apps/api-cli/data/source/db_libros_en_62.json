It's easier than you think. In just a couple of weeks, build a ray-tracer that renders beautiful scenes with shadows, reflections, brilliant refraction effects, and subjects composed of various graphics primitives: spheres, cubes, cylinders, triangles, and more. With each chapter, implement another piece of the puzzle and move the renderer that much further forward. Do all of this in whichever language and environment you prefer, and do it entirely test-first, so you know it's correct. Recharge yourself with this project's immense potential for personal exploration, experimentation, and discovery.\n\nThe renderer is a ray tracer, which means it simulates the physics of light by tracing the path of light rays around your scene. Each exciting chapter presents a bite-sized piece of the puzzle, building on earlier chapters and setting the stage for later ones. Requirements are given in plain English, which you translate into tests and code. When the project is complete, look back and realize you've built an entire system test-first!\n\nThere's no research necessary -- all the necessary formulas and algorithms are presented and illustrated right here. Dive into intriguing topics from fundamental concepts such as vectors and matrices; to the algorithms that simulate the intersection of light rays with spheres, planes, cubes, cylinders, and triangles; to geometric patterns such as checkers and rings. Lighting and shading effects, such as shadows and reflections, make your scenes come to life, and constructive solid geometry (CSG) enables you to combine your graphics primitives in simple ways to produce complex shapes.\n\nPlay and experiment as you discover the fun of writing a ray tracer.

It means that your product has been created with the intention of being accessible to as many different users as possible. For a long time, the concept of accessibility has been limited in terms of only defining physical spaces. However, change is afoot: personal technology now plays a part in the everyday lives of most of us, and thus it is a responsibility for designers of apps, web pages, and more public-facing tech products to make them accessible to all. Our digital era brings progressive ideas and paradigm shifts – but they are only truly progressive if everybody can participate.\nIn Inclusive Design for a Digital World, multiple crucial aspects of technological accessibility are confronted, followed by step-by-step solutions from User Experience Design professor and author Regine Gilbert. Think about every potential user who could be using your product. Could they be visually impaired? Have limited motor skills? Be deaf or hard of hearing? This book addresses a plethora of web accessibility issues that people with disabilities face. Your app might be blocking out an entire sector of the population without you ever intending or realizing it. For example, is your instructional text full of animated words and Emoji icons? This makes it difficult for a user with vision impairment to use an assistive reading device, such as a speech synthesizer, along with your app correctly. In Inclusive Design for a Digital World, Gilbert covers the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 requirements, emerging technologies such as VR and AR, best practices for web development, and more.\nAs a creator in the modern digital era, your aim should be to make products that are inclusive of all people.

Designed to solve problems in combining and using major computer system components, virtual machine technologies play a key role in many disciplines, including operating systems, programming languages, and computer architecture. For example, at the process level, virtualizing technologies support dynamic program translation and platform-independent network computing. At the system level, they support multiple operating system environments on the same hardware platform and in servers.Historically, individual virtual machine techniques have been developed within the specific disciplines that employ them (in some cases they aren’t even referred to as “virtual machines), making it difficult to see their common underlying relationships in a cohesive way. In this text, Smith and Nair take a new approach by examining virtual machines as a unified discipline. Pulling together cross-cutting technologies allows virtual machine implementations to be studied and engineered in a well-structured manner. Topics include instruction set emulation, dynamic program translation and optimization, high level virtual machines (including Java and CLI), and system virtual machines for both single-user systems and servers.* Examines virtual machine technologies across the disciplines that use them—operating systems, programming languages and computer architecture—defining a new and unified discipline.* Reviewed by principle researchers at Microsoft, HP, and by other industry research groups.* Written by two authors who combine several decades of expertise in computer system research and development, both in academia and industry.","tags":["IT Operations","Virtualization"]},{"id":"9781803245478","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Low Poly 3D Modeling in Blender","authors":["Samuel Sullins"],"pages":"318","publication_date":"February 2024","description":"Take your first steps into the exciting world of 3D modeling with \"Low Poly 3D Modeling in Blender\" by Samuel Sullins.

The mission is to keep the user in mind at each step or milestone as the developer progresses through the project. The process is how that mission is accomplished through collaboration and the use of research, design and development technologies. This book walks you through a developer's journey through the UX process, from start to finish. \n\nA Guide to UX Design and Development concentrates on the intersection of what is called “DesignOps” and “DevOps.” That intersection is where collaboration between all members of the team, including stakeholders and clients, occurs and neither DesignOps nor DevOps can go beyond being considered just buzzwords if they instead silo design and development. To highlight the UX Mission and illustrate the responsibility developers also hold for the user experience, authors Tom Green and Joseph Labrecque take you througha hypothetical project involving the development of a parking app for a municipal parking authority. As the book progresses, they concentrate on the developer's journey through the whole project from discovery to product release. In this journey, you will see how developers can make an impact and contribute to the user experience.\n\nThis will include such topics as why there is a need for both a user journey map and a technical journey map. The authors explain why prototyping is not as complicated as it is made out to be because it is simply an early low-cost and disposable minimal viable product that gives the developer a deep understanding of the project's intent in support of the UX Mission. You will also explore the creation and use of design systems and why the developer's role is just as important as the people who create the design system.

Finite State Machines (FSM) have numerous advantages; they can be applied to many areas (including motor control, and signal and serial data identification to name a few) and they use less logic than their alternatives, leading to the development of faster digital hardware systems.\n\nThis clear and logical book presents a range of novel techniques for the rapid and reliable design of digital systems using FSMs, detailing exactly how and where they can be implemented. With a practical approach, it covers synchronous and asynchronous FSMs in the design of both simple and complex systems, and Petri-Net design techniques for sequential/parallel control systems. Chapters on Hardware Description Language cover the widely-used and powerful Verilog HDL in sufficient detail to facilitate the description and verification of FSMs, and FSM based systems, at both the gate and behavioural levels.\n\nThroughout, the text incorporates many real-world examples that demonstrate designs such as data acquisition, a memory tester, and passive serial data monitoring and detection, among others. A useful accompanying CD offers working Verilog software tools for the capture and simulation of design solutions.\n\nWith a linear programmed learning format, this book works as a concise guide for the practising digital designer.

After starting with a clear explanation of the Docker model, you will learn how to package applications in containers, including techniques for testing and distributing applications. You will also learn how to run programs securely and how to manage shared resources. Using carefully designed examples, the book teaches you how to orchestrate containers and applications from installation to removal. Along the way, you'll discover techniques for using Docker on systems ranging from dev-and-test machines to full-scale cloud deployments.\n\nAbout the Technology\n\nThe idea behind Docker is simple. Create a tiny virtual environment, called a container, that holds just your application and its dependencies. The Docker engine uses the host operating system to build and account for these containers. They are easy to install, manage, and remove. Applications running inside containers share resources, making their footprints small.\n\nAbout the BookWhat's Inside\nPackaging containers for deployment\nInstalling, managing, and removing containers\nWorking with Docker images\nDistributing with DockerHub\nAbout the Reader\n\nReaders need only have a working knowledge of the Linux OS.

Although usability testing is a critical part of an effective user-centered life cycle, it is only one component of the UCD process. This book is focused on the requirements gathering stage, which often receives less attention than usability testing, but is equally as important. Understanding user requirements is critical to the development of a successful product. Understanding Your Users is an easy to read, easy to implement, how-to guide on usability in the real world. It focuses on the \"user requirements gathering\" stage of product development and it provides a variety of techniques, many of which may be new to usability professionals. For each technique, readers will learn how to prepare for and conduct the activity, as well as analyze and present the data —all in a practical and hands-on way. In addition, each method presented provides different information about the user and their requirements (e.g., functional requirements, information architecture, task flows). The techniques can be used together to form a complete picture of the users’ requirements or they can be used separately to address specific product questions. These techniques have helped product teams understand the value of user requirements gathering by providing insight into how users work and what they need to be successful at their tasks. Case studies from industry-leading companies demonstrate each method in action. In addition, readers are provided with the foundation to conduct any usability activity (e.g., getting buy-in from management, legal and ethical considerations, setting up your facilities, recruiting, moderating activities) and to ensure the incorporation of the results into their products.·Covers all of the significant requirements gathering methods in a readable, practical way·Presents the foundation readers need to prepare for any requirements gathering activity and ensure that the results are incorporated into their products ·Includes invaluable worksheet and template appendices·Includes a case study for each method from industry leaders·Written by experienced authors who teach conference courses on this subject to usability professionals and new product designers alike","tags":["Design","Product Design","Web Design","Usability"]},{"id":"9781558607125","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Usability Engineering","authors":["Mary Beth Rosson","John M.

They explore core-periphery relation¬ships between promotors who control strategic choices, and suppliers, the contracted experts who provide the actual resources to get the project done. The impli¬cations of these structural–performance relationships within a robust economy are then compared with railroad and highway development projects in the developing economies of Nigeria, Uganda, and India.\n\nThis in-depth study brings a complementary perspective to megaproject literature and enables us to reconcile conflicting explanations for the regularity with which megaprojects miss performance targets. With pluralism at the core of the megaproject’s organizational structure, the authors argue that megaprojects work best when accountability is shared and everyone has a stake in the final outcome.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Engineering","Civil Engineering","Urban Planning"]},{"id":"9780134269276","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Storage Design and Implementation in vSphere 6: A Technology Deep Dive, 2nd Edition","authors":["Mostafa Khalil"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"July 2017","description":"Now fully updated: The authoritative, comprehensive guide to vSphere 6 storage implementation and management\n\nEffective VMware virtualization storage planning and management has become crucial—but it can be extremely complex.

It covers the theoretical foundations and the major solutions that have been presented in the literature. It also establishes links between solutions proposed by different communities that studied 3D shape, such as mathematics and statistics, medical imaging, computer vision, and computer graphics.\n\nThe first part of 3D Shape Analysis: Fundamentals, Theory, and Applications provides a review of the background concepts such as methods for the acquisition and representation of 3D geometries, and the fundamentals of geometry and topology. It specifically covers stereo matching, structured light, and intrinsic vs. extrinsic properties of shape. Parts 2 and 3 present a range of mathematical and algorithmic tools (which are used for e.g., global descriptors, keypoint detectors, local feature descriptors, and algorithms) that are commonly used for the detection, registration, recognition, classification, and retrieval of 3D objects. Both also place strong emphasis on recent techniques motivated by the spread of commodity devices for 3D acquisition. Part 4 demonstrates the use of these techniques in a selection of 3D shape analysis applications. It covers 3D face recognition, object recognition in 3D scenes, and 3D shape retrieval. It also discusses examples of semantic applications and cross domain 3D retrieval, i.e. how to retrieve 3D models using various types of modalities, e.g. sketches and/or images. The book concludes with a summary of the main ideas and discussions of the future trends.\n\n3D Shape Analysis: Fundamentals, Theory, and Applications is an excellent reference for graduate students, researchers, and professionals in different fields of mathematics, computer science, and engineering.

They will talk about it, invite their friends, complain, sing its high praises, and dissect it in countless ways. With the right design strategy you can use this social interaction to get people signing up, coming back regularly, and bringing others into the fold. With tons of examples from real-world interfaces and a touch of the underlying social psychology theory, Joshua Porter shows you how to design your next great social web application. Inside, you’ll discover: • The real reasons why people participate online and the psychology behind them • The Usage Lifecycle—or how people use your web application over time • How to get people past that trickiest of hurdles: sign-up • What to do when you’ve launched a web application and nobody is using it • How to analyze the effectiveness of your application screens and flows • How to grow your social web application from zero users to 1000—and beyond Designing for the social web is about much more than adding features. It’s about embracing the social interaction of the people who make you successful—and then designing smartly to encourage it.","tags":["Design","Product Design","User Experience (UX)","Interaction Design"]},{"id":"0131927590","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"HP-UX i Version 2 System Administration HP Integrity and HP 9000 Servers","authors":["Marty Poniatowski"],"pages":"672","publication_date":"May 2005","description":"This is the definitive guide to installing and administering HP-UX 11i Version 2 in any environment, on both HP 9000 and HP Integrity server families.\n\nDrawing on 18 years of on-site HP-UX consulting experience, Marty Poniatowski offers unparalleled practical insight into running HP-UX 11i efficiently and reliably, illuminating features even experienced HP-UX sysadmins find confusing.

There's no introduction to Visual Basic, no explanation of how it fits into the .NET world. Why waste time reading about something you'll learn for yourself as soon as you start creating applications? You won't even write a \"Hello World\" program. With Programming Visual Basic 2005 you'll get started building something meaningful, right away.\n\nThe book is divided into three parts--Building Windows Applications, Building Web Applications, and Programming with Visual Basic--each of which could be a book on its own. The author shares his thorough understanding of the subject matter through lucid explanations and intelligently designed lessons that guide you to increasing levels of expertise. By the time you've finished the book, you'll know how to program both Windows and web applications with VB 2005.\n\nThe support for this book extends beyond its covers.

Typically, such extensions as customized context menu handlers, per instance icons (such as a data file icon that's based on the contents of the file), and customized property sheets are written in C++, and all of the available documentation focuses on using C++ for shell extensions. But even C++ programmers find the task rough going, given the woefully inadequate state of the documentation. Very few programmers know that writing shell extensions is not tied to a single language or development environment, and that Visual Basic is an excellent tool for creating shell extensions that more closely tie an application to the Windows shell. That, however, is precisely the focus of Visual Basic Shell Programming. It shows how to take advantage of shell services to develop shell extensions and it provides the basic documentation needed for accomplishing this. Each major type of shell extension gets attention, including:\n\nContext menu handlers that can add items to the popup menu that appears when the user right clicks a file.\n\ncon handlers for displaying per instance icons that, like the standard Recycle Bin icon, vary depending on some condition\n\nProperty sheet pages, which appear when the user selects the Properties option from a file's context menu.\n\nInfoTip handlers, which display tooltips, or \"info\" tips for a file object on a per instance basis.\n\nPointers. Since VB tends to hide pointers from the programmer, Hamilton shows how to take advantage of the undocumented VarPtr, StrPtr, and ObjPtr functions, as well as the Win32\n\nRtlMoveMemory function.\n\nUsing class identifiers (CLSIDs) from Visual Basic.\n\nVTable modification, which allows control of the HRESULT (or status code) returned by a call to a COM method.\n\nIn showing how to integrate applications with the Windows shell by building shell extensions, author J.P. Hamilton provides a concrete tutorial on COM programming with Visual Basic.

Every action you request creates one or more messages to carry out the action. These messages are passed between objects and carry with them information that gives the recipient more detail on how to interpret and act upon the message.With Subclassing and the Windows hooking mechanism (\"hooks\"), you can manipulate, modify, or even discard messages bound for other objects within the operating system, in the process changing the way the system behaves. What kinds of results can you achieve using the power of subclassing and hooking? Here are just a few of the possibilities:\n\nDetermine when a window is being activated or deactivated and respond to this change.\nDisplay descriptions of menu items as the mouse moves across them.\nDisallow a user to move or resize a window.\nDetermine where the mouse cursor is and respond accordingly.\nDetermine when the display resolution has been changed.\nMonitor the system for a low system resource condition.\nModify or disallow keystrokes sent to a window or a control.\nCreate an automated testing application.\nDetermine when an application is idle.\nAlong with this power comes responsibility; Windows is very unforgiving if subclassing and hooking are used incorrectly. Subclassing & Hooking with Visual Basic demonstrates the various techniques for intercepting messages bound for one or more windows or controls: the intercepted message can be left in its original state or modified; afterwards, the message can be sent to its original destination or discarded.For both VB 6 and VB.NET developers, Subclassing & Hooking with Visual Basic opens up a wealth of possibilities that ordinarily would be completely unavailable, or at least not easy to implement.","tags":["Software Development","Programming Languages",".NET","VB"]},{"id":"9780133415865","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Adobe® Premiere® Pro CC Classroom in a Book®","authors":["Adobe Creative Team"],"pages":"480","publication_date":"July 2013","description":"The fastest, easiest, most comprehensive way to learn Adobe Premiere Pro CC\n\nClassroom in a Book®, the best-selling series of hands-on software training workbooks, offers what no other book or training program does–an official training series from Adobe Systems Incorporated, developed with the support of Adobe product experts.\n\nAdobe Premiere ProCC Classroom in a Book contains 19 lessons that cover the basics, providing countless tips and techniques to help you become more productive with the program.

Now it's shaking things up again as editor Walter Murch, director Anthony Minghella, and a long list of Hollywood heavy-hitters are proving that this under-$1,000 software can (and should) be used to edit a multi-million dollar motion picture! This book tells the story of that endeavor: the decision to use Final Cut Pro, the relationship between the technology and art (and craft) of movie-making, how Final Cut Pro was set up and configured for Cold Mountain, how the software's use affected the work flow, and its implications for the future of filmmaking. More than anything, however, this is Murch's own story of what seemed to many a crazy endeavor-- told through photos, journal entries, email musings, and anecdotes that give readers an inside view of what the film editor does and how this particular film progressed through post-production. The book includes, in his own words, Murch's vision, approach, and thoughts on storytelling as he shapes Cold Mountain under the intense pressures of completing a major studio film.\n\nWith Academy Awards for his work on Apocalypse Now and The English Patient, sound and film editor Walter Murch is one of the few universally acknowledged editing masters in cinema. Along with George Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola, he is one of the founding members of the Northern California cinema community. Author Charles Koppelman has been writing screenplays and directing video and film since the early 1980s, including the independent feature film, Dumbarton Bridge, award-winning documentaries, and commercials.\n\n\"An exploration inside the editorial engine-room of a major feature film - the first book of its kind ever and sure to remain the best. Charles Koppelman chronicles Walter Murch's astonishing high-wire trapeze act as he works his way through the first large-scale implementation of Apple's Final Cut Pro editing software. Must be read by anyone interested in film, computers, or how the creative process unfolds.\" -- Francis Ford Coppola, director of The Conversation, The Godfather, Apocalypse Now\n\n\"This is probably the subtlest and most tender account of what a craftsman brings to a motion picture ever written. It is fascinating in its detail and awesome in its gradual uncovering of the ear, the eye and the soul of Walter Murch. The book may seem technical, or 'professional,' but any reader will be thrilled by the description of a struggle and the necessary commitment to it. To be read by anyone who has ever thought it might be fun to make a movie.\" -- David Thomson, film critic and author of The Biographical Dictionary\n\n\"BEHIND THE SEEN is not only revelatory in terms of technical innovation, but it reads like a thrilling suspense novel. Superbly written and paced, the book captures the brilliant and daring film/sound editor-scientist Walter Murch in all his passionate and creative glory.

Yet critical software projects consistently come in late, defective, and way over budget. So what's the problem?\n\nGet ready for a shock, because the answer to the problem is to avoid reality altogether. A new IT practice and technology called Service Virtualization (SV) is industrializing the process of simulating everything in our software development and test environments. Yes, fake systems are even better than the real thing for most of the design and development lifecycle, and SV is already making a huge impact at some of the world's biggest companies.\n\nService Virtualization: Reality Is Overrated is the first book to present this powerful new method for simulating the behavior, data, and responsiveness of specific components in complex applications. By faking out dependency constraints, SV delivers dramatic improvements in speed, cost, performance, and agility to the development of enterprise application software.\n\nWriting for executive and technical readers alike, SV inventor John Michelsen and Jason English capture lessons learned from the first five years of applying this game-changing practice in real customer environments. Other industries—from aviation to medicine—already understand the power of simulation to solve real-world constraints and deliver new products to market better, faster, and cheaper. Now it's time to apply the same thinking to our software.\n\nFor more information, see servicevirtualization.com.\n\nWhat you'll learn\n\nYou will learn why, when, where, and how to deploy service virtualization (SV) solutions to mitigate or eliminate the constraints of an unavailable or unready service system by simulating its dependent components in order to deliver better enterprise software faster and at lower cost. In particular, you will learn step-by-step why, when, where, and how to deploy the following SV solutions:\n\nshift-left\n\ninfrastructure availability\n\nperformance readiness\n\ntest scenario management\n\nWho this book is for\n\nThis book is not only for IT practitioners on engineering, testing, and environments teams engaged in the development and delivery of enterprise software, but also for executives of companies in all sectors who need to understand and implement emergent opportunities to improve the time to market and overall competitiveness of any outward-facing business strategy that has a software application component.","tags":["IT Operations","Virtualization"]},{"id":"9780133005660","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Adobe® Premiere Pro® CS6 Classroom in a Book®","authors":["Adobe Creative Team"],"pages":"480","publication_date":"July 2012","description":"Those creative professionals seeking the fastest, easiest, most comprehensive way to learn Adobe Premiere Pro CS6 choose Adobe Premiere Pro CS6 Classroom in a Book from the Adobe Creative Team at Adobe Press.

In this profound new book, Korten shares the results of his search for a story that reflects the fullness of human knowledge and understanding and provides a guide to action adequate to the needs of our time.Korten calls our current story Sacred Money and Markets. Money, it tells us, is the measure of all worth and the source of all happiness. Earth is simply a source of raw materials. Inequality and environmental destruction are unfortunate but unavoidable. Although many recognize that this story promotes bad ethics, bad science, and bad economics, it will remain our guiding story until replaced by one that aligns with our deepest understanding of the universe and our relationship to it.To guide our path to a viable human future, Korten offers a Sacred Life and Living Earth story grounded in a cosmology that affirms we are living beings born of a living Earth itself born of a living universe. Our health and well-being depend on an economy that works in partnership with the processes by which Earth's community of life maintains the conditions of its own existence—and ours.

Vine enables users to shoot short (six-second max) looping videos on their mobile phones and then share those videos with online friends. Vine videos (called vines) can be viewed from a user’s Vine or Twitter feed, shared via Facebook, or embedded in web pages and blogs. This makes Vine like a video version of Instagram, enabling users to “share life in motion” via social networking.\n\nThis has made Vine enormously popular, especially among the same younger users who made Instagram a hit. Just three months after its release, Vine has become the #1 free app in Apple’s U.S. App Store, and is used on 2.66% of all iOS devices  — more than any other video app. In addition, 2.8% of Twitter users are also Vine users . These numbers puts Vine’s userbase at somewhere between 4 to 6 million users, who upload more than 2,000 new videos each hour. There is no user manual for Vine, nor much in the way of online help files. Anyone wanting to get on the Vine bandwagon can use some help not just learning the basic shooting and sharing features, but also figuring out how to create more sophisticated types of vines.\n\nSams Teach Yourself Vine in 10 Minutes is a one-stop shop for everything associated with Vine, from shooting basic videos to sharing those videos socially to creating more sophisticated and artistic videos.

The authors make several noteworthy contributions to the literature on EU cohesion policy and shed light on the use of the repayable instruments within public interventions, while providing, for the first time, a critical analysis of the JESSICA sustainable funding model from the holistic perspective which is especially relevant for supporting sustainable urban development.\n\nFinancial Engineering in Sustainable Funding of Urban Development in the EU provides policy-significant findings that are important for EU cohesion policy in the field of repayable assistance to be reinvested in the long term in urban and regional transformation.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Engineering","Civil Engineering","Urban Planning"]},{"id":"9783110635638","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Place-Making in the Declarative City","authors":["Beatrix Busse","Ingo H.

Rose"],"pages":"150","publication_date":"December 2015","description":"The virtual work world is upon us. It is ever increasing as both workers and organizations become more familiar with this new structure. The way leaders and managers deal with the virtual worker will become increasingly more important. This book takes a look at the virtual work environment from a view of human perceptions. Trust, isolation, and presence are the three main human perceptions discussed throughout the book and are the foundation for the theory presented. The Change–Self-Efficacy Loop Theory provides the basis for a new tool to maximize the productivity level of the virtual worker. The book takes a journey from the industrial revolution through a second shift or technology revolution which we are currently experiencing known as the virtual work environment. It presents argument and ideas to encourage all of us to take action now to prevent the potential negative outcomes that could affect many working in the virtual work environment. The book is designed for anyone associated with the virtual work environment. Based on the premise that the virtual work environment needs to be a productive alternative to the traditional work environment, the book focuses on variables that can create the most successful outcome.","tags":["IT Operations","Virtualization"]}]
