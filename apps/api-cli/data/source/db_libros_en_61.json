However, the recent takeover of VMware by Broadcom has brought unprecedented changes that have unsettled the industry. These changes include the end of perpetual licenses, alterations to the licensing model requiring a minimum purchase of 16 cores, termination of existing contracts, and a significant increase in licensing costs. Such developments have posed challenges for numerous organizations worldwide.\n\nAs cloud modernization gains momentum, organizations are gradually reducing their dependence on on-premises infrastructure. While cloud adoption is on the rise, certain factors such as compliance, security, and legal restrictions necessitate the retention of specific resources on-premises. Despite the growing cloud trend, VMware remains the preferred choice for many specialists due to its longstanding presence. However, Broadcom’s actions to exploit this niche hosting requirement by significantly raising product costs have left many organizations feeling betrayed and actively seeking alternatives.\n\nThis book provides objective insights to help organizations break free from vendor lock-in and navigate the changing landscape. It delves into the ruthless changes introduced by Broadcom to VMware and discusses the challenges of transitioning to alternatives. By offering a practical understanding of various available options, including emerging virtualization technologies, the book empowers industry experts to manage their existing dependence on VMware effectively. Real-world case studies and examples further reinforce the argument for adopting diverse VMware alternatives tailored to the unique settings of each organization.\n\nWhat You Will Learn\n\nReview the unprecedented changes brought about by Broadcom’s takeover of VMware, including the termination of perpetual licenses, alterations to licensing models, and substantial increases in licensing costs.\nUnderstand the evolving landscape of virtualization technology and the challenges organizations face in transitioning away from VMware.\nStudy the practical strategies and emerging virtualization technologies available as alternatives to VMware.\n\nWho This Book Is For\n\n IT architects, Admins, Technical Managers, CTOs, and Infrastructure solution experts.","tags":["IT Operations","Virtualization","VMware"]},{"id":"9781098129040","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Programming with OpenSCAD","authors":["Justin Gohde","Marius Kintel"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"August 2021","description":"OpenSCAD is freely available open source software that enables nondesigners to easily create 3D designs using a text-based programming language.

They represent a significant proportion of many nations’ economic activity and profoundly affect productivity, social cohesion, and the environment. Yet megaprojects have proved notoriously difficult to deliver on time and on budget; one estimate suggests that 90% of them end up over budget.Based on more than 10 years of research into a number of megaprojects in London, including the infrastructure for the London 2012 Olympics and the construction of two new terminals at Heathrow Airport, the authors conclude that one way to manage the uncertainties inherent in megaprojects is to innovate throughout the course of the project. What’s more, they argue that their suggestions are applicable to all large-scale, long-term projects — not just projects with billon-dollar budgets.Specifically, the authors offer five rules for innovation in large high-risk projects, providing managers with guidance on how to modify their plans and processes when opportunities arise or conditions change. The five rules are: (1) assess what’s worked before by studying comparable projects before you begin; (2) organize for the unforeseen by encouraging project teams to be flexible and using more flexible contracts for more unpredictable parts of the project; (3) rehearse first by testing any new technologies and practices in off-site trials, dry runs, or other operational environments before introducing them to the large project; (4) calibrate and apportion risks appropriately by creating different contracts and collaborative arrangements to address the varying challenges of individual subprojects within the program; and (5) harness innovation from start to finish with an innovation strategy that can be communicated to partners working on the project. “These simple rules,” the authors write, “challenge traditional project management, which has pushed too far toward control and prescription and been characterized by complicated, highly rigid contracts that stifle flexibility and innovation. These five rules might seem like common sense, but the marked failures of past megaprojects show the value of making such sense much more common.”","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Engineering","Civil Engineering","Urban Planning"]},{"id":"9781839211256","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Mastering Kubernetes - Third Edition","authors":["Gigi Sayfan"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"June 2020","description":"This is the ultimate hands-on guide to mastering Kubernetes, the leading container orchestration platform, and its ecosystem.

Your UI technology -- web applications, desktop software, even mobile devices -- may give you the tools you need, but little guidance on how to use them well.\n\nUI designers over the years have refined the art of interface design, evolving many best practices and reusable ideas. If you learn these, and understand why the best user interfaces work so well, you too can design engaging and usable interfaces with less guesswork and more confidence.\n\nDesigning Interfaces captures those best practices as design patterns -- solutions to common design problems, tailored to the situation at hand. Each pattern contains practical advice that you can put to use immediately, plus a variety of examples illustrated in full color. You'll get recommendations, design alternatives, and warningson when not to use them.\n\nEach chapter's introduction describes key design concepts that are often misunderstood, such as affordances, visual hierarchy, navigational distance, and the use of color. These give you a deeper understanding of why the patterns work, and how to apply them with more insight.\n\nA book can't design an interface for you -- no foolproof design process is given here -- but Designing Interfaces does give you concrete ideas that you can mix and recombine as you see fit.

The perspective-based user interface inspection is based on the principle that different perspectives will find different problems in a user interface. In the related persona-based inspection, colleagues assume the roles of personas and review the product based on the needs, background, tasks, and pain points of the different personas. The cognitive walkthrough focuses on ease of learning.\n\nMost of the inspection methods do not require users; the main exception is the pluralistic walkthrough, in which a user is invited to provide feedback while members of a product team listen, observe the user, and ask questions.\n\nAfter reading this book, you will be able to use these UI inspection methods with confidence and certainty.","tags":["Software Development","QA / Testing","User Acceptance Testing"]},{"id":"9781803244082","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Squeaky Clean Topology in Blender","authors":["Michael Steppig"],"pages":"248","publication_date":"December 2022","description":"Squeaky Clean Topology in Blender is your ultimate guide to understanding and mastering modeling topology for Blender.

It focuses on giving the reader mastery over the concepts, methods and metrics of digital video coding, so that readers have sufficient understanding to choose and tune coding parameters for optimum results that would suit their particular needs for quality, compression, speed and power.\n\nThe practical aspects are many: Uploading video to the Internet is only the beginning of a trend where a consumer controls video quality and speed by trading off various other factors. Open source and proprietary applications such as video e-mail, private party content generation, editing and archiving, and cloud asset management would give further control to the end-user.\n\nDigital video is frequently compressed and coded for easier storage and transmission. This process involves visual quality loss due to typical data compression techniques and requires use of high performance computing systems. A careful balance between the amount of compression, the visual quality loss and the coding speed is necessary to keep the total system cost down, while delivering a good user experience for various video applications. At the same time, power consumption optimizations are also essential to get the job done on inexpensive consumer platforms.\n\nTrade-offs can be made among these factors, and relevant considerations are particularly important in resource-constrained low power devices. To better understand the trade-offs this book discusses a comprehensive set of engineering principles, strategies, methods and metrics. It also exposes readers to approaches on how to differentiate and rank video coding solutions.","tags":["Design","Visual Design","Film & Video","Video Production"]},{"id":"9781785285073","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Blender 3D By Example","authors":["Romain Caudron","Pierre-Armand Nicq"],"pages":"334","publication_date":"September 2015","description":"Blender 3D By Example guides you through creating stunning 3D models and scenes using Blender, an open-source 3D software.

In addition to saving time and other resources, virtualization affords unprecedented means for intrusion and malware detection, prevention, recovery, and analysis. Taking a practical approach in a growing market underserved by books, this hands-on title is the first to combine in one place the most important and sought-after uses of virtualization for enhanced security, including sandboxing, disaster recovery and high availability, forensic analysis, and honeypotting.Already gaining buzz and traction in actual usage at an impressive rate, Gartner research indicates that virtualization will be the most significant trend in IT infrastructure and operations over the next four years. A recent report by IT research firm IDC predicts the virtualization services market will grow from $5.5 billion in 2006 to $11.7 billion in 2011. With this growth in adoption, becoming increasingly common even for small and midsize businesses, security is becoming a much more serious concern, both in terms of how to secure virtualization and how virtualization can serve critical security objectives. Titles exist and are on the way to fill the need for securing virtualization, but security professionals do not yet have a book outlining the many security applications of virtualization that will become increasingly important in their job requirements. This book is the first to fill that need, covering tactics such as isolating a virtual environment on the desktop for application testing, creating virtualized storage solutions for immediate disaster recovery and high availability across a network, migrating physical systems to virtual systems for analysis, and creating complete virtual systems to entice hackers and expose potential threats to actual production systems.About the TechnologiesA sandbox is an isolated environment created to run and test applications that might be a security risk. Recovering a compromised system is as easy as restarting the virtual machine to revert to the point before failure. Employing virtualization on actual production systems, rather than just test environments, yields similar benefits for disaster recovery and high availability. While traditional disaster recovery methods require time-consuming reinstallation of the operating system and applications before restoring data, backing up to a virtual machine makes the recovery process much easier, faster, and efficient. The virtual machine can be restored to same physical machine or an entirely different machine if the original machine has experienced irreparable hardware failure. Decreased downtime translates into higher availability of the system and increased productivity in the enterprise.Virtualization has been used for years in the field of forensic analysis, but new tools, techniques, and automation capabilities are making it an increasingly important tool. By means of virtualization, an investigator can create an exact working copy of a physical computer on another machine, including hidden or encrypted partitions, without altering any data, allowing complete access for analysis. The investigator can also take a live ?snapshot? to review or freeze the target computer at any point in time, before an attacker has a chance to cover his tracks or inflict further damage.","tags":["IT Operations","Virtualization"]},{"id":"9780240813493","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Photoshop 3D for Animators","authors":["Rafiq Elmansy"],"pages":"293","publication_date":"October 2012","description":"Photoshop is not just for photographers anymore.

Now, for the first time, leading VMware expert Edward Haletky brings together comprehensive guidance for identifying and mitigating virtualization-related security threats on all VMware platforms, including the new cloud computing platform, vSphere.\n\nThis book reflects the same hands-on approach that made Haletky’s VMware ESX Server in the Enterprise so popular with working professionals. Haletky doesn’t just reveal where you might be vulnerable; he tells you exactly what to do and how to reconfigure your infrastructure to address the problem.\n\nVMware vSphere and Virtual Infrastructure Security begins by reviewing basic server vulnerabilities and explaining how security differs on VMware virtual servers and related products. Next, Haletky drills deep into the key components of a VMware installation, identifying both real and theoretical exploits, and introducing effective countermeasures.\n\nCoverage includes\n\n•    Viewing virtualization from the attacker’s perspective, and understanding the new security problems it can introduce\n\n•    Discovering which security threats the vmkernel does (and doesn’t) address\n\n•    Learning how VMsafe enables third-party security tools to access the vmkernel API\n\n•    Understanding the security implications of VMI, paravirtualization, and VMware Tools\n\n•    Securing virtualized storage: authentication, disk encryption, virtual storage networks, isolation, and more\n\n•    Protecting clustered virtual environments that use VMware High Availability, Dynamic Resource Scheduling, Fault Tolerance, vMotion, and Storage vMotion\n\n•    Securing the deployment and management of virtual machines across the network\n\n•    Mitigating risks associated with backup, performance management, and other day-to-day operations\n\n•    Using multiple security zones and other advanced virtual network techniques\n\n•    Securing Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI)\n\n•    Auditing virtual infrastructure, and conducting forensic investigations after a possible breach\n\ninformit.com/ph   |   www.Astroarch.com","tags":["IT Operations","Virtualization","VMware","vSphere"]},{"id":"9780123786241","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Thoughts on Interaction Design","authors":["Jon Kolko"],"pages":"168","publication_date":"March 2010","description":"Thoughts on Interaction Design explores the theory behind the field of Interaction Design in a new way. It aims to provide a better definition of Interaction Design that encompasses the intellectual facets of the field and the particular methods used by practitioners in their day-to-day experiences. It also attempts to provide Interaction Designers with the vocabulary necessary to justify their existence to other team members. The book positions Interaction Design in a way that emphasizes the intellectual facets of the discipline. It discusses the role of language, argument, and rhetoric in the design of products, services, and systems. It examines various academic approaches to thinking about Design, and concludes that the Designer is a liberal artist left to infuse empathy in technologically driven products. The book also examines the tools and techniques used by practitioners. These include methods for structuring large quantities of data, ways of thinking about users, and approaches for thinking about human behavior as it unfolds over time. Finally, it introduces the idea of Interaction Design as an integral facet of the business development process.\n\n*First book to provide a solid definition and framework for the booming field of interaction design, finally giving designers the justification needed to prove their essential role on every development team\n\n*Provides designers with tools they need to operate effectively in the workplace without compromising their goals: making useable, useful, and desirable products\n\n*Outlines process, theory, practice, and challenges of interaction design – intertwined with real world stories from a variety of perspectives","tags":["Design","Product Design","User Experience (UX)","Interaction Design"]},{"id":"9780240808390","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"High Definition Postproduction","authors":["Steven E.

The days are long gone when it was possible to crank out an app over the weekend and refine it after receiving a few not so flattering user reviews. Users now have choices -- lots of them. If your app is difficult to use or doesn’t meet their needs, finding another one is just a tap away.\n\nTo illustrate, consider the ever-growing field of Twitter clients. There are hundreds of variations in the App Store but only a handful stand out from the pack (such as Tweetie or Twitterific). For most apps, it boils down to one thing: the user experience. The same is true for countless other categories within the App Store; well-designed apps are more likely to attract and retain users. Of course there are other critical aspects of iPhone app development: the coding, the marketing, the customer support. All of the elements must come together.\n\nDesigning the iPhone User Experience will help you tackle the user experience part of the iPhone challenge. Three key themes will be reinforced throughout the book: Know thy user, the Design Lifecycle, and Attention to Detail:\n\nMillions of people depend on iPhone apps to get them to work, find their next meal, and stay in touch with family and friends. Professionals of all kinds also rely on iPhone apps: doctors look up drug interactions; photographers fine-tune lighting; cyclists find the best routes. To truly understand how your apps can fit into their lives, designers and developers must learn how users do things today, what’s important to them, and what needs have not been met. Part II, , will introduce a variety of user research methods.\n\nKnow Thy UserIntroduction to User Research\n\nAward-winning designs rarely happen overnight; they usually only occur after many rigorous design cycles. To illustrate this point, consider USA TODAY's iPhone application, which went through at least seven iterations for the article view in their app. These kinds of iterations should happen before you launch your app, since it will save valuable time and money, not to mention the headaches a bad design could create for your user. More importantly, you may only have one chance to impress your users -- you do not want to sell them half-baked ideas. Part III, , will explain how to iteratively design and test your app concepts.\n\nThe Design LifecycleDeveloping your App Concept\n\nMost professionals know that attention to detail is important, but hundreds of apps fail to incorporate even the most basic design principles. This lack of attention is not merely an aesthetic issue (which is important) it also affects the way apps function. For example, a news article without proper alignment will be difficult to read, and a poorly rendered icon will be challenging to interpret. Apps with a razor sharp attention to detail will stand out because their apps will look good and perform well. Part IV, , will show you how to make to your app shine, from visual design and branding to accessibility and localization.\n\nAttention to DetailRefining your App Concept\n\nMastering these three areas will help set your app apart from the crowd. You may not have an award-winning app over night. But knowing your users, iterative design, and attention to detail are important first steps.","tags":["Design","Product Design","User Experience (UX)","User Research"]},{"id":"9780735663138","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Microsoft® Visual Basic® 2010 Developer’s Handbook","authors":["Klaus Löffelmann and Sarika Calla Purohit"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"August 2011","description":"Your expert guide to building modern applications with Visual Basic 2010\n\nTake control of Visual Basic 2010—for everything from basic Windows and web development to advanced multithreaded applications.

As a result more and more designers have turned to VHDL to help them dramatically improve productivity as well as the quality of their designs.\n\nVHDL, the IEEE standard hardware description language for describing digital electronic systems, allows engineers to describe the structure and specify the function of a digital system as well as simulate and test it before manufacturing. In addition, designers use VHDL to synthesize a more detailed structure of the design, freeing them to concentrate on more strategic design decisions and reduce time to market. Adopted by designers around the world, the VHDL family of standards have recently been revised to address a range of issues, including portability across synthesis tools.\n\nThis best-selling comprehensive tutorial for the language and authoritative reference on its use in hardware design at all levels--from system to gates--has been revised to reflect the new IEEE standard, VHDL-2001. Peter Ashenden, a member of the IEEE VHDL standards committee, presents the entire description language and builds a modeling methodology based on successful software engineering techniques.

The Orphanage was created by three twenty-something visual effects veterans who wanted to make their own feature films and discovered they could do this by utilizing home computers, off the shelf software, and approaching things artistically. This guide details exactly how to do this: from planning and selecting the necessary cameras, software, and equipment, to creating specific special effects (including gunfire, Kung Fu fighting, car chases, dismemberment, and more) to editing and mixing sound and music. Its mantra is that the best, low-budget action moviemakers must visualize the end product first in order to reverse-engineer the least expensive way to get there. Readers will learn how to integrate visual effects into every aspect of filmmaking--before filming, during filming and with \"in camera\" shots, and with computers in postproduction. Throughout the book, the author makes specific references to and uses popular action movies (both low and big-budget) as detailed examples--including El Mariachi, La Femme Nikita, Die Hard, and Terminator 2.

The video-taperecorder was an addition to the technology of mass communications, a handy gadget for recording synchronized images and sound on magnetic tapes for storage or simultaneous playback. But the authors of this study look at it as also mirror, relay and catalyst, offering creative possibilities of exploration and criticism, of active analysis and transformation, of self-discovery and communication. They discern a liberating potential of video an antidote to the dominance of centralized TV in consumer society and ultimately a means towards the progressive social reappropriation of the media of communication.\n\nThe authors draw on their experience working with school-children, teenagers, and a variety of cultural, political and community groups to illustrate the versatility of video in approaching diverse situations of everyday life, whether from the viewpoint of ‘cultural animation’, sociological research, or a surrealistic game. These projects, and interviews with other practitioners, present here the basis for a first typology of styles and approaches in using video, and for a ‘videology’: a language, a set of concepts, and a theory comprehending process and praxis, image and action. This is a fascinating snapshot now, looking back at these early ideas.","tags":["Design","Visual Design","Film & Video","Video Production"]},{"id":"9780240807904","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"3ds Max 8 Essentials","authors":["Autodesk"],"pages":"776","publication_date":"March 2014","description":"Welcome to the Autodesk Media and Entertainment Official Training Courseware for 3ds Max 8 software!

That means: Incredibly fast access to data and applications for users, no third party VPN connection, and no latency issues. All of these features make Citrix Presentation Server a great tool for increasing access and productivity for remote users. Unfortunately, these same features make Citrix just as dangerous to the network it's running on. By definition, Citrix is granting remote users direct access to corporate servers?..achieving this type of access is also the holy grail for malicious hackers. To compromise a server running Citrix Presentation Server, a hacker need not penetrate a heavily defended corporate or government server. They can simply compromise the far more vulnerable laptop, remote office, or home office of any computer connected to that server by Citrix Presentation Server. All of this makes Citrix Presentation Server a high-value target for malicious hackers. And although it is a high-value target, Citrix Presentation Servers and remote workstations are often relatively easily hacked, because they are often times deployed by overworked system administrators who haven't even configured the most basic security features offered by Citrix. \"The problem, in other words, isn't a lack of options for securing Citrix instances; the problem is that administrators aren't using them.\" (eWeek, October 2007). In support of this assertion Security researcher Petko D.

At the same time architects began to use digital media as a new material apart from concrete, glass or wood to create buildings and urban structures. Simultaneously, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) researchers began to exploit the interaction opportunities between users and buildings and to bridge the gaps between interface, information medium and architecture. As an example, they extended architectural structures with interactive, light-emitting elements on their outer shell, thereby transforming the surfaces of these structures into giant public screens. At the same time the wide distribution of mobile devices and the coverage of mobile internet allow manifold interaction opportunities between open data and citizens, thereby enabling the internet of things in the public domain. However, the appropriate distribution of information to all citizens is still cumbersome and a mutual dialogue not always successful (i.e. who gets what data and when?).

Habitually alert to the happy accident, and possessed of highly eclectic interests and a quirky wit, he has happened into his perfect career. Around this habit–call it a philosophy–of asking, “Why does this have to be this way? What if . . .,” Dawes has built magneticNorth, an acclaimed Web and interaction design practice, based in Manchester, U.K. In this unique book, Dawes invites readers inside a series of his personal projects to get a view of his process--his creative seeing, making, and playing. He encourages designers to look beyond the normal tools of their trade to find inspiration in the most unlikely of places: tubs of children’s clay, anonymous notes, household plumbing fixtures, jazz music, snow globes, fast-food take-out bags, airport departure gates, and more. Brilliant, original, and always grounded in the needs of users, Dawes shares both the techniques he has created and the key lessons he has learned in design: why comfort is the enemy of creativity; how mistakes can be celebrated instead of feared, and how to strip design to its purest and most powerful forms. Known worldwide for his entertaining and inspirational presentations, Dawes now brings profound insights to a book that is certain to become a classic inspiration for designers of every type.

The main goal of the book is to enable technical artists, hobbyists, and students in using the noncommercial (NCR), free RenderMan® edition. \n \nRenderMan® is an industry standard for rendering software. It has been used for every Pixar film to date and numerous other projects. RenderMan® 21, and all subsequent versions, use Monte Carlo path tracing. This change has necessitated the use of C++ plugins in place of the RenderMan Shader Language (RSL). Because of this, writing Bxdfs now requires knowledge of Monte Carlo integration, probability density functions, and the RenderMan® C++ API. \n \nEssential Guide to RenderMan® Shading Plugin Development specifically addresses writing RenderMan® C++ materials. It explores the mathematical models of representative Bxdfs while drawing parallels, when helpful, to earlier RSL implementations. It also includes an overview of Integrators, providing further context for modern RenderMan® programmable shading.\n \nWhat You Will Learn\nC++ development for Bxdfs\nFundamentals of the rendering equation\nMonte Carlo integration\n \nWho Is This Book For\nBeginner plugin writers for RenderMan®, such as technical artists, students, or hobbyists who may already have experience with RSL or another shader language.

Fitzpatrick","C.

Today's increasingly fast pace of software development--as programmers make small changes to software one day only to undo them the next--has only heightened the problem; consecutive work on code or single-programmer software is a rare sight these days. Without careful attention to version control, concurrent and collaborative work can create more headaches than it solves. This is where Subversion comes into play.Written by members of the Subversion open source development team, Version Control with Subversion introduces the powerful new versioning tool designed to be the successor to the Concurrent Version System or CVS. CVS users will find the \"look and feel\" Subversion comfortably familiar, but under the surface it's far more flexible, robust, and usable, and more importantly, it improves on CVS's more notable flaws.The book begins with a general introduction to Subversion, the basic concepts behind version control, and a guided tour of Subversion's capabilities and structure. With thorough attention to detail, the authors cover every aspect of installing and configuring Subversion for managing a programming project, documentation, or any other team-based endeavor. Later chapters cover the more complex topics of branching, repository administration, and other advanced features such as properties, externals, and access control. The book ends with reference material and appendices covering a number of useful topics such as a Subversion complete reference and troubleshooting guide.Version Control with Subversion aims to be useful to readers of widely different backgrounds, from those with no previous experience in version control to experienced sysadmins. If you've never used version control, you'll find everything you need to get started in this book. And if you're a seasoned CVS pro, this book will help you make a painless leap into Subversion.","tags":["Software Development","Software Collaboration","Version Control System","Subversion"]},{"id":"0672321564","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Creating and Consuming Web Services in Visual Basic®","authors":["Scott Seely","Eric A.

Yet cities in developing countries are typically characterized by high-density urban areas and poor public transport, as well as lack of proper roads, parking facilities, road user discipline, and control of land use, resulting in pollution, congestion, accidents, and a host of other transportation problems. Public Transport Planning and Management in Developing Countries examines the status of urban transport in India and other developing countries. It explains the principles of public transport planning and management that are relevant and suitable for developing countries, addresses current transportation system inefficiencies, explores the relationship between mobility and accessibility, and analyzes the results for future use.\n\nConsiders Socioeconomic and Demographic Characteristics\n\nIt’s projected that by 2030, developing nations will have more vehicles than developed nations, and automated guided transit (AGT) and other transport systems will soon be available in India. This text compares five cities using specific indicators—urbanization, population growth, vehicle ownership, and usage. It determines demographic and economic changes in India, and examines how these changes have impacted transportation demand and supply, transport policy and regulations, and aspects of economics and finance related to public transport. The authors emphasize preserving and improving existing modes, efficient use of the public transport management infrastructure, implementing proper planning measures, and encouraging a shift towards sustainable modes. They also discuss sustainability in terms of environment, energy, economic, and land use perspectives and consider the trends of motorization, vehicle growth, modal share, effects on mobility and environment, and transport energy consumption and emissions.\n\nPublic Transport Planning and Management in Developing Countries\n\naddresses the growing resource needs and economics of public transport in developing countries, explains various aspects of public transport planning and management, and provides readers with a basic understanding of both urban and rural public transport planning and management in developing countries.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Engineering","Civil Engineering","Urban Planning"]},{"id":"9781789617849","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Implementing VMware Horizon 7.7 - Third Edition","authors":["Jason Ventresco"],"pages":"520","publication_date":"January 2019","description":"In \"Implementing VMware Horizon 7.7,\" you'll gain a comprehensive understanding of VMware's Horizon platform and its latest features, including App Volumes and the Just-in-Time Management Platform (JMP).

End users get frustrated with the applications because they were not built with their use cases in mind. For a long time, it was assumed that the developers who created the code should drive their programs and be responsible for all scenarios. While generally not an issue in simple programs, this view is wrong for complex applications in the field of science. These end users are the best specialists in their respective fields and need applications to work beyond the scenarios prepared and allowed for by developers.\n\nThis book teaches you methods to manage your applications in a way that gives control to your target end users. You will learn proven methods using an easy and predictable instrument, the all-powerful algorithm, to create objects that are movable and re-sizable by users.\n\nGet ready to learn by example, using an algorithm of total movability and experience, implemented in different situations.

A first part examines the concepts and their implications. The second part deals with the anthropology and typology of architectural production considered in relation to demography. The third part develops on the rhythms of the space production at Lyon from the late 15th century to the 19th. The temporalities and spatialities of the production are determined and examined. The agents of the production are studied all along the period, in parallel to the market aimed at: investors in real estate, tenants, activities.

Volume 1 starts with an introduction, discusses planning, then describes z/VM installation into a two-node single system image (SSI) cluster, configuration, hardening, automation, and servicing. It adopts a cookbook format that provides a concise, repeatable set of procedures for installing and configuring z/VM by using the z/VM SSI clustering feature.\n\nVolume 1 consists of the following chapters:\n\nChapter 1, “Introduction to Linux on the IBM mainframe under z/VM” on page 3. This chapter provides a concise introduction to the concept of using the z/VM platform as an enterprise Linux infrastructure on the IBM mainframe.\n\nChapter 2, “Planning” on page 15. This chapter covers the planning of hardware, software, and networking resources that you need to do before you attempt to install z/VM and Linux.\n\nChapter 3, “Configuring a workstation for mainframe access” on page 39. This chapter addresses the configuration of a workstation that is running either Linux or Windows to access the mainframe.\n\nChapter 4, “Installing and configuring z/VM” on page 49. This chapter describes installing z/VM 6.3 as a two-node VM Single System Image feature (VMSSI) cluster, performing the initial configuration, hardening, and enabling basic system automation.\n\nChapter 5, “Servicing z/VM” on page 153. This chapter focuses on the requirements to keep your z/VM systems updated to ensure full functionality, optimal utility, security, and the elimination of known problems. The process of ordering and applying z/VM Service is described. Programming Temporary Fixes (PTFs) and Recommended Service Upgrades (RSUs) are both covered.\n\nChapter 6, “Planning and preparing for Linux workloads” on page 171. This chapter describes the necessary steps to begin your first Linux installation. It describes common tasks that are executed during administration, maintenance, and expansion to accommodate additional workloads.\n\nVolumes 2 and 3 describe how to Linux virtual servers on IBM z Systems™ hardware under IBM z/VM. The cookbook format continues with installing and customizing Linux.\n\nFor Volume 1, you need at least two IBM z Systems logical partitions (LPARs) with associated resources and z/VM 6.3 installation media. For Volumes 2 and 3, you will need either the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server (RHEL) version 7.1 or the SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) version 12 distribution (or both).\n\nThis book series assumes that you are generally familiar with z Systems technology and terminology. It does not assume an in-depth understanding of z/VM or Linux. It is written for those individuals who want to start quickly with z/VM and Linux on the mainframe, and get virtual servers up and running in a short time (days, not weeks or months).","tags":["IT Operations","Virtualization"]},{"id":"9781118029961","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Introducing Autodesk® Revit® Architecture 2012: Autodesk® Official Training Guide","authors":["Patrick Davis"],"pages":"720","publication_date":"August 2011","description":"A fast, focused introduction to Revit functions, tools, and concepts\n\nAs the leading Building Information Modeling software package, Revit is praised for its ease of use, power, and sophistication.

Insofar as they are large and densely populated human settlements with defined legal and political boundaries that comprise clusters of buildings, open spaces, public facilities and infrastructure, cities are mainly spaces of services that are exchanged between a wide variety of stakeholders-namely, residents, traders, visitors, and the city authorities. Moreover, the provision of cities' services has profound effect on the local and global sustainability. Thus, municipal services should comprise environmental, social, and economic values, which are designed, produced, and delivered in concert. Over the years, a variety of new urban models and concepts have been designed and proposed as viable means to reestablish the bond between the human and the natural environments, to increase the quality of life within cities and to reduce the impacts that cities have on the social and natural environments (e.g., sustainable city, smart city, or resilient city). Herein, a new model of the service city is presented, including architecture and several pertinent examples, which considers it as a platform that manages and integrates the services and systems currently provided by the city while offering additional supporting services to increase the effectiveness of the value and to achieve the goal of sustainability.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Engineering","Civil Engineering","Urban Planning","Smart Cities"]},{"id":"9780240811734","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"The Video Editor's Guide to Soundtrack Pro","authors":["Sam McGuire","Paul Lee"],"pages":"288","publication_date":"November 2012","description":"This book tells you how, why, and when you should perform certain audio postproduction tasks within Soundtrack Pro 3 while editing your video in the Final Cut Studio suite.
