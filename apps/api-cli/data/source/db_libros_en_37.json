But treating management as the default path for an engineer with leadership ability doesn't serve the industry well--or the engineer. The staff engineer's path allows engineers to contribute at a high level as role models, driving big projects, determining technical strategy, and raising everyone's skills.\n\nThis in-depth book shows you how to understand your role, manage your time, master strategic thinking, and set the standard for technical work. You'll read about how to be a leader without direct authority, how to plan ahead to make the right technical decisions, and how to make everyone around you better, while still growing as an expert in your domain.\n\nBy exploring the three pillars of a staff engineer's job, Tanya Reilly, a veteran of the staff engineer track, shows you how to:\n\nTake a broad, strategic view when thinking about your work\nDive into practical tactics for making projects succeed\nDetermine what \"good engineering\" means in your organization","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Engineering Leadership"]},{"id":"53863MIT59128","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"How to Become a Game-Changing Leader","authors":["Douglas A. Ready","Alan Mulally"],"pages":"9","publication_date":"October 2017","description":"The authors argue that it is increasingly important for business leaders to learn how to build companies that are simultaneously purpose-driven, performance-focused, and principles-led. At a time when the pace of change in business is faster than ever, they believe that building organizations with these three characteristics is no longer a choice. Being performance-driven is clearly essential to success; continuous disruption, rapid technological innovation, and turbulence require that today’s leaders build agile organizations with resilient employees in order to achieve superior performance. But focusing on results alone is not enough. Demographic, cultural, and technological changes have led to a workforce that demands a set of operating principles characterized by core values such as transparency, trust, inclusion, and real-time collaboration to help guide behaviors and decision-making in companies. Finally, studies have shown that millennials are deeply motivated by corporate social responsibility and a compelling sense of purpose. Together, these forces make the case that companies that fail to aspire to align purpose, performance, and principles will also fail to attract the best talent. Furthermore, to achieve the kind of transformations that today’s fast-moving economy often requires of businesses, executives need engaged, committed employees who have opportunities to contribute their knowledge. Purpose and principles can help engage employees in support of high performance. The authors acknowledge that while it is easy for executives to say they aspire to build companies that are simultaneously purpose-driven, performance-focused, and principles-led, it is a difficult accomplishment to achieve. There are often inherent tensions and conflicting goals associated with trying to achieve all three aims. How can executives align purpose, performance, and principles so that they can lead their organizations through major changes? The authors’ research and experience suggest the task requires not only a set of leadership skills that they describe but also five mindsets that encompass the embedded tensions that face leaders of large, complex organizations. Executives must learn to reconcile these tensions by mastering a series of five conflicting yet complementary dualities: urgency and patience; collective and individual accountability; coaching and driving performance; student and teacher; and humility and boldness. One of the authors, Alan Mulally, the former CEO of Ford Motor Co., describes the role these dualities played when he led a successful turnaround of that company.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9780787960759","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Five Dysfunctions of a Team: A Leadership Fable","authors":["Patrick M.

This time, he turns his keen intellect and storytelling power to the fascinating, complex world of teams.\n\nKathryn Petersen, Decision Tech's CEO, faces the ultimate leadership crisis: Uniting a team in such disarray that it threatens to bring down the entire company. Will she succeed? Will she be fired? Will the company fail? Lencioni's utterly gripping tale serves as a timeless reminder that leadership requires as much courage as it does insight.\n\nThroughout the story, Lencioni reveals the five dysfunctions which go to the very heart of why teams even the best ones-often struggle. He outlines a powerful model and actionable steps that can be used to overcome these common hurdles and build a cohesive, effective team. Just as with his other books, Lencioni has written a compelling fable with a powerful yet deceptively simple message for all those who strive to be exceptional team leaders.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9789083381831","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"The Software Engineer's Guidebook","authors":["Gergely Orosz"],"pages":"403","publication_date":"June 2023","description":"In my first few years as a developer I assumed that hard work was all I needed. Then I was passed over for a promotion and my manager couldn’t give me feedback on what areas to improve, so I could get to the senior engineer level. I was frustrated; even bitter: not as much about missing the promotion, but because of the lack of guidance.\n\nBy the time I became a manager, I was determined to support engineers reporting to me with the kind of feedback and support I wish I would have gotten years earlier. And I did. While my team tripled over the next two years, people became visibly better engineers, and this progression was clear from performance reviews and promotions.\n\nThis book is a summary of the advice I’ve given to software engineers over the years – and then some more.\n\nThis book follows the structure of a “typical” career path for a software engineer, from starting out as a fresh-faced software developer, through being a role model senior/lead, all the way to the staff/principle/distinguished level. It summarizes what I’ve learned as a developer and how I’ve approached coaching engineers at different stages of their careers.\n\nWe cover “soft” skills which become increasingly important as your seniority increases, and the “hard” parts of the job, like software engineering concepts and approaches which help you grow professionally.\n\nThe names of levels and their expectations can – and do! – vary across companies. The higher “tier” a business is, the more tends to be expected of engineers, compared to lower tier places. For example, the “senior engineer” level has notoriously high expectations at Google (L5 level) and Meta (E5 level,) compared to lower-tier companies. If you work at a higher-tier business, it may be useful to read the chapters about higher levels, and not only the level you’re currently interested in.\n\nThe book is composed of six standalone parts, each made up of several chapters:\n\nPart 1: Developer Career FundamentalsPart 2: The Competent Software DeveloperPart 3: The Well-Rounded Senior EngineerPart 4: The Pragmatic Tech LeadPart 5: Role Model Staff and Principal EngineersPart 6: Conclusion\n\nParts 1 and 6 apply to all engineering levels, from entry-level software developer, to principal-and-above engineer. Parts 2, 3, 4, and 5 cover increasingly senior engineering levels and group together topics in chapters, such as “Software Engineering,” “Collaboration,” “Getting Things Done,” etc.\n\nNaming and levels vary, but the principles of what makes a great engineer who is impactful at the individual, team, and organizational levels, are remarkably constant. No matter where you are in your career, I hope this book provides a fresh perspective and new ideas on how to grow as an engineer.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Engineering Leadership"]},{"id":"9781119212041","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Organizational Culture and Leadership, 5th Edition","authors":["Edgar H.

Different cultures teach different values and we carry those values throughout adulthood and into the office environment. Understanding the cultural and gender viewpoints of our colleagues is a major key to healthy, conflict-free work environments.\n\nThis fable takes its name from a Chinese children's parable about how \"the loudest duck gets shot.\" It's a parable that contrasts with the American idiom \"the squeaky wheel gets the grease.\" Comparing the two, it's clear that different cultures teach different views, and those views often translate into distinct ways of doing business. In today's global business world, understanding each other-where we come from and what we're taught-is more important than ever.\n\nA business fable that points out how the old way of approaching diversity will never work, showing us how to understand and navigate the cultural and gender differences that cause conflict in the office\n\nPerfect for managers and executives faced with leadership challenges in a heterogeneous workforce and who want to make sure their organization is a true meritocracy and a level playing field for everyone\n\nIdeal for anyone, at any level, who wants more tools in their toolbox to get ahead in business in a global business culture\n\nDoing business today takes understanding and cultural intelligence. The Loudest Duck uses an entertaining story to share important lessons about why diversity efforts are bound to fail unless we really understand how we unconsciously respond to difference and how to move to beyond it.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Culture in Business"]},{"id":"9781780175430","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Data Strategy","authors":["Ian Wallis"],"pages":"316","publication_date":"August 2021","description":"A well thought out, fit-for-purpose data strategy is vital to modern data-driven businesses.

Amy Edmondson shows that organizations thrive, or fail to thrive, based on how well the small groups within those organizations work. In most organizations, the work that produces value for customers is carried out by teams, and increasingly, by flexible team-like entities. The pace of change and the fluidity of most work structures means that it's not really about creating effective teams anymore, but instead about leading effective teaming.\n\nTeaming shows that organizations learn when the flexible, fluid collaborations they encompass are able to learn. The problem is teams, and other dynamic groups, don't learn naturally. Edmondson outlines the factors that prevent them from doing so, such as interpersonal fear, irrational beliefs about failure, groupthink, problematic power dynamics, and information hoarding. With Teaming, leaders can shape these factors by encouraging reflection, creating psychological safety, and overcoming defensive interpersonal dynamics that inhibit the sharing of ideas. Further, they can use practical management strategies to help organizations realize the benefits inherent in both success and failure.\n\nPresents a clear explanation of practical management concepts for increasing learning capability for business results\n\nIntroduces a framework that clarifies how learning processes must be altered for different kinds of work\n\nExplains how Collaborative Learning works, and gives tips for how to do it well\n\nIncludes case-study research on Intermountain healthcare, Prudential, GM, Toyota, IDEO, the IRS, and both Cincinnati and Minneapolis Children's Hospitals, among others\n\nBased on years of research, this book shows how leaders can make organizational learning happen by building teams that learn.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management"]},{"id":"9781394310647","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"The Data Hero Playbook","authors":["Malcolm Hawker"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"July 2025","description":"A powerful new mindset for data leaders in any organization\n\nIn The Data Hero Playbook: Developing Your Data Leadership Superpowers, veteran data professional and thought leader Malcolm Hawker offers fresh and exciting new ways to collect, manage, and use data.

But questions only seek answers—inquiry provides insight. When, instead of just questions, clients hear their thoughts, opinions, and beliefs spoken by someone else, it prompts them to critically consider how their thinking affects their goals. Reynolds cites the latest brain science to show why reflective inquiry works and provides techniques, tips, and structures for creating breakthrough conversations. This book will free coaches from the cult of asking the magical question by offering five essential practices of reflective inquiry: focus on the person, not the problem; summarize what is heard and expressed; identify underlying beliefs and assumptions; unwrap the desired outcome; and articulate insights and commitments. Using these practices, combined with a respectful and caring presence, helps create a space where clients feel safe, seen, and valued for who they are. Coaches become change agents who actively recharge the human spirit.

A must-read guide for executives and leaders at any stage of their career!” ―Marshall Goldsmith, Thinkers50 #1 Leadership Thinker and #1 New York Times bestselling author of Triggers\n\nBusinesses—large and small—have their day-to-day operations disrupted by new and unforeseen circumstances. Typically, these disruptions manifest themselves in many forms, such as disappointing top-line results, low employee engagement, the war for talent, a lack of creativity and innovation, eroding profit margins, price wars, fraud, and ethics violations.\n\nSuch unintended and unwanted effects are mere symptoms of a dysfunctional business system. That means their root causes are inherent to that system’s design, structure, or organization, implementation or operation, maintenance, and management, which are all exclusive executive responsibilities. Until executives adapt and adjust their business systems accordingly, these problems will keep recurring―prompting the erroneous belief they are without solution.\n\nIn this groundbreaking guide, change-management consultant Hans Norden challenges you to rethink your approach to solving stubborn enterprise-wide problems by demonstrating that real solutions are in fact readily available. Rather than prescribing HOW to solve a dysfunctional system’s countless symptoms, he describes WHY systemic problems occur and keep manifesting in one form or another. Once you understand the principles that explain and predict the outcome of your decision-making process, you will forge ahead with purpose and confidence, feeling empowered to solve stubborn systemic problems with authentic and lasting solutions.\n\nYou’ll gain expert invaluable insight into:\n\nWhy change initiatives require a form of leadership different from routine operations.\nWhy diagnosing systemic problems makes all the difference in the successful outcome of change management initiatives, including changing strategic direction.\nWhy recognizing behavioral patterns―such as human error―prevents unnecessary friction and conflict, and enhances business performance.\nWhy growing bottom-line results tends to erode a business system’s sustainable performance.\nWhy developing a business system’s capability and capacity enhances its sustainable performance.\nWhy neither people nor technology can outperform a business system’s capability and capacity.\nWhy the existence of net profits doesn’t necessarily constitute success—and vice versa.\n\nWhether you’ve been running your organization for years or you’re an up-and-coming C-suite leader, a trusted advisor or financier, with The Root Cause, you have everything you need to help create and deliver authentic solutions to drive sustainable success for years to come.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Strategic Thinking"]},{"id":"9780061757587","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Winning","authors":["Jack Welch","Suzy Welch"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"October 2009","description":"Jack Welch knows how to win.

Leadership has since pushed it off. Henry Mintzberg aims to restore management to its proper place: front and center. “We should be seeing managers as leaders.” Mintzberg writes, “and leadership as management practiced well.” This landmark book draws on Mintzberg's observations of twenty-nine managers, in business, government, health care, and the social sector, working in settings ranging from a refugee camp to a symphony orchestra. What he saw—the pressures, the action, the nuances, the blending—compelled him to describe managing as a practice, not a science or a profession, learned primarily through experience and rooted in context.But context cannot be seen in the usual way. Factors such as national culture and level in hierarchy, even personal style, turn out to have less influence than we have traditionally thought. Mintzberg looks at how to deal with some of the inescapable conundrums of managing, such as, How can you get in deep when there is so much pressure to get things done? How can you manage it when you can't reliably measure it? This book is vintage Mintzberg: iconoclastic, irreverent, carefully researched, myth-breaking. Managing may be the most revealing book yet written about what managers do, how they do it, and how they can do it better.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781119824756","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Diversity, Equity & Inclusion For Dummies","authors":["Dr. Shirley Davis"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"January 2022","description":"Strengthen your company culture through inclusive and equitable policies and practices\n\nThe global workforce and marketplace will continue to undergo dramatic demographic shifts—redefining the workplace, the workers, and how work gets done.

However, changes in the career landscape in recent years, including global mobility,an increasingly diverse workforce and shortened job tenures, present managers with new complexitiesand uncertainties. The notion that one mentor can meet all of an individual’s developmental needs isoften inconceivable. Instead, the authors argue that there are a number of network support roles beyondthat of formal mentor. As individuals change roles, industries or organizations or relocate to differentcountries, they need to build a “personal board of advisors” that fits their careers and their busy lives.The authors’ research suggests that individuals seek career and psychosocial support from multiplepeople. In their research the authors found that most of the members of people’s personal boards ofadvisors played an active role in supporting the individuals’ career and personal development. However,some individuals also mentioned the importance of people who had passed away but continued tomotivate and inspire them. The authors identified six types of personal board members: personalguides, personal advisors, full-service mentors, career advisors, career guides and role models.TYPE I: Personal Guides A personal guide is someone who had a supportive relationship with theprotégé in the past, but the two have limited or no current interaction. Personal guides may have beencloser to the protégé in an earlier period, but now they are mainly considered to be role models orsources of motivation and inspiration.TYPE II: Personal Advisors Personal advisors frequently interact with protégés outside of work.They may serve as an emotional outlet or sounding board, offer friendship and/or provide acceptanceand confirmation of one’s capabilities.TYPE III: Full-Service Mentors Full-service mentors provide the protégé with a wide range ofcareer and psychosocial support. These relationships are characterized by strong closeness andfrequent interaction.TYPE IV: Career Advisors Career advisors have high levels of interaction with the protégé. Theirsupport is predominantly instrumental and career related, involving job or professional needs. As aresult, these relationships tend to be shorter in duration.TYPE V: Career Guides Career guides have limited interaction with the individual or have fairlylimited relationships. Their involvement in the person’s professional/personal development is oftentriggered by specific events — for example, a crisis or a critical career change. They step in only if andwhen developmental assistance is needed.TYPE VI: Role Models The authors’ research findings suggest that important developmental relationships don’t have to be close or even direct. In particular, the interaction between a protégé andhis/her role model (or, in some cases, an anti-role model) may be passive or even nonexistent.By developing self-awareness and periodically reassessing their needs, the authors conclude, individualscan find advisors who can help them meet their business and personal goals.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management"]},{"id":"9781604913859","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Leadership in Action: In Focus - Leader Development - Personal Lives, Powerful Lessons","authors":["Marian N.

You quickly create a strategic initiative in response and appoint your best people to make change happen. And it doesbut not fast enough. Or effectively enough. Real value gets lost and, ultimately, things drift back to the default status.Why is this scenario so frequently repeated in industries and organizations across the world? In the groundbreaking new book Accelerate (XLR8), leadership and change management expert, and best-selling author, John Kotter provides a fascinating answerand a powerful new framework for competing and winning in a world of constant turbulence and disruption.Kotter explains how traditional organizational hierarchies evolved to meet the daily demands of running an enterprise. For most companies, the hierarchy is the singular operating system at the heart of the firm. But the reality is, this system simply is not built for an environment where change has become the norm. Kotter advocates a new systema second, more agile, network-like structure that operates in concert with the hierarchy to create what he calls a dual operating system”one that allows companies to capitalize on rapid-fire strategic challenges and still make their numbers.Accelerate (XLR8) vividly illustrates the five core principles underlying the new network system, the eight Accelerators that drive it, and how leaders must create urgency in others through role modeling. And perhaps most crucial, the book reveals how the best companies focus and align their people’s energy and urgency around what Kotter calls the big opportunity.If you’re a pioneer, a leader who knows that bold change is necessary to survive and thrive in an ever-changing world, this book will help you accelerate into a better, more profitable future.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9780750638616","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"People and Self Management","authors":["Sally Palmer"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"June 2007","description":"People and Self Management leads the reader through all the skills needed for today's supervisor/team leader, including:\n\n* how to assess and improve your workplace performance;\n* the essential skills of effective self management;\n* the management of change.\n\nThe Team Leader Development Series is an essential tool towards gaining the Supervisory Management Award.

Thomas Chermack, a top expert on scenario planning, offers seven specific ways organizations can use scenarios and provides a wide variety of examples, along with proven processes, exercises, and workshops that have been used successfully in organizations across industries and countries for more than fifteen years.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9780133994834","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Science of Successful Organizational Change: How Leaders Set Strategy, Change Behavior, and Create an Agile Culture","authors":["Paul Gibbons"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"May 2015","description":"Every leader understands the burning need for change–and every leader knows how risky it is, and how often it fails. To make organizational change work, you need to base it on science, not intuition. Despite hundreds of books on change, failure rates remain sky high. Are there deep flaws in the guidance change leaders are given? While eschewing the pat answers, linear models, and change recipes offered elsewhere, Paul Gibbons offers the first blueprint for change that fully reflects the newest advances in mindfulness, behavioral economics, the psychology of risk-taking, neuroscience, mindfulness, and complexity theory.\n\nChange management, ostensibly the craft of making change happen, is rife with myth, pseudoscience, and flawed ideas from pop psychology.  In Gibbons’ view, change management should be “euthanized” and replaced with change agile businesses, with change leaders at every level.  To achieve that, business education and leadership training in organizations needs to become more accountable for real results, not just participant satisfaction (the “edutainment” culture). \n\nTwenty-first century change leaders need to focus less on project results, more on creating agile cultures and businesses full of staff who have “get to” rather than “have to” attitudes. To do that, change leaders will have to leave behind the old paradigm of “carrots and sticks,” both of which destroy engagement. \n\n“New analytics” offer more data-driven approaches to decision making, but present a host of people challenges—where petabyte information flows meet traditional decision-making structures. These approaches will have to be complemented with “leading with science”—that is, using evidence-based management to inform strategy and policy decisions.\n\nIn The Science of Successful Organizational Change, you'll learn:\n\nHow the VUCA (Volatile, Uncertain, Complex, and Ambiguous) world affects the scale and pace of change in today’s businesses\n\nHow understanding of flaws in human decision-making can help leaders guide their teams toward wiser strategic decisions when the stakes are largest—including “when to trust your guy and when to trust a model” and “when all of us are smarter than one of us”\n\nHow new advances in neuroscience have altered best practices in influencing colleagues; negotiating with partners; engaging followers' hearts, minds, and behaviors; and managing resistance\n\nHow leading organizations are making use of the science of mindfulness to create agile learners and agile cultures\n\nHow new ideas from analytics, forecasting, and risk are humbling those who thought they knew the future–and how the human side of analytics and the psychology of risk are paradoxically more important in this technologically enabled world\n\nWhat complexity theory means for decision-making in the context of your own business\n\nHow to create resilient and agile business cultures and anti-fragile, dynamic business structures\n\nTo link science with your \"on-the-ground\" reality, Gibbons tells “warts and all” stories from his twenty-plus years consulting to top teams and at the largest businesses in the world. You'll find case studies from well-known companies like IBM and Shell and CEO interviews from Nokia and Barclays Bank.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9780814437186","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Extreme Teams","authors":["Robert Bruce Shaw"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"February 2017","description":"Managers want great teams, but most build them around decades-old ideas and practices made popular by companies that have lost their edge.\n\nExtreme Teams looks at the new generation of teams driving growth in today’s most innovative firms.

Maciariello"],"pages":"496","publication_date":"December 2014","description":"Peter Drucker was the original big thinker. His ideas on management, innovation, leadership, effectiveness, and adapting to change formed the foundations of modern business wisdom. Drucker was also a mentor to many notable leaders in business, government, and nonprofits, a role he valued tremendously. In A Year with Peter Drucker, you will get to experience his mentorship process firsthand as his longtime collaborator Joseph A. Maciariello leads you from week to week, lesson to lesson, using previously unpublished material and selected readings from Drucker's classic works to highlight critical lessons in leadership, personal effectiveness, and mission-driven strategy. It features examples from the individuals and organizations that Drucker helped to guide to success, including his work assisting leaders in creating some of the world's most influential religious organizations.\n\nJoseph A. Maciariello has distilled the essence of Drucker's personal mentorship program into an easy-to-follow 52-week course. Each week contains a lesson, message, or anecdote taken from Drucker's extensive body of published and unpublished work, moving from theme to theme throughout the year. It also includes further readings and reflections on the week's subject, and deep reflection questions—or quick brainstorming prompts—to help readers incorporate the message into their day-to-day work.\n\nThe year will cover the themes Drucker felt were most important to leadership development, such as\n\nLeaders Must Set Sights on the important and not the urgent. This is a key differentiator of moving from being a functionary to being a leader.\nManagement is a Human Activity. Process must serve people, in and out of the organzation.\nThe Roadmap to Personal Effectiveness depends on a clear mission and on doing the right things, not just getting things done.\nManagement succession, especially to top positions, is a crucial decision and often a big gamble. It's worth your time to get it right.\n\nMaciariello, who worked alongside Drucker as a collaborator on a number of his books, delivers the ultimate Drucker companion—and the next best thing to being mentored by the legend himself.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9780133127478","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Developing Management Skills, Ninth Edition","authors":["David A.

Where individuals self-manage their commitments to each other without the coercion of managers. And where teams launch new products and ventures on the market without the control of leaders.These organizations represent a new, radically collaborative breed of corporation.

Readers will also learn about:\n\nShortcuts that lead to dead ends when managing resistance, including thinking “man does not want to change” and “one third is always against it anyways”\nExplanatory models behind resistance, including emotional events, attempts at domination, normative control, and expression of a damaged relationship\nPrinciples to productively manage resistance, including commitment, dignity, right to dissent, learning, and mindfulness\n\nBeyond No earns a well-deserved spot on the bookshelves of all business leaders, executives, and managers seeking to achieve excellence in leadership through a thoughtful approach to resistance instead of relying on ineffective command-and-control tactics.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781422142738","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Progress Principle","authors":["Teresa Amabile","Steven Kramer"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"July 2011","description":"What really sets the best managers above the rest? It’s their power to build a cadre of employees who have great inner work lives—consistently positive emotions; strong motivation; and favorable perceptions of the organization, their work, and their colleagues. The worst managers undermine inner work life, often unwittingly.\n\nAs Teresa Amabile and Steven Kramer explain in The Progress Principle, seemingly mundane workday events can make or break employees’ inner work lives. But it’s forward momentum in meaningful work—progress—that creates the best inner work lives. Through rigorous analysis of nearly 12,000 diary entries provided by 238 employees in 7 companies, the authors explain how managers can foster progress and enhance inner work life every day.\n\nThe book shows how to remove obstacles to progress, including meaningless tasks and toxic relationships.

By the end of his tenure, 12 years later, the Nation had grown its assets from $150 million to $1.2 billion, increased business profits 2,000 percent, created 6,000 jobs, and dramatically advanced its education, language, and cultural preservation programs.\n\nHow could one team influence such vast positive change?\n\nThe Cherokee Nation's dramatic transformation was the result of Smith's principle-based leadership approach and his unique \"Point A to Point B model\"--the simple but profound idea that the more you focus on the final goal, the more you will accomplish . . . and the more you will learn along the way.

Yet companies continue to struggle with toxic cultures, and the low productivity and unhappiness that go with them.\n\nWhy is “culture” so difficult to improve? What makes so many good employees check out? Neuroscientist Paul Zak shows that innate brain functions hold the answers. It all boils down to trust.\n\nWhen someone shows you trust, a feel-good jolt of oxytocin surges through your brain and triggers you to reciprocate. This simple mechanism creates a perpetual trust-building cycle—the key to changing stubborn workplace patterns.\n\nDrawing on his original research, Zak teases out science-backed insights for building high-trust organizations. Trust Factor opens a window on how brain chemicals affect behavior, why trust gets squashed, and ways to consciously stimulate it by celebrating effort, sharing information, promoting ownership, and more. The Ofactor™ survey, data, and examples support the action plans.\n\nEngagement programs and monetary rewards are Band-Aids on broken bones. To get to the root of the problem, you’ve got to go deeper.

They graduate at higher rates than men and have higher average GPAs. But then a strange thing happens: upon entering the workforce, they immediately lose their advantage. When the first promotions come around, the slide continues. For every 100 men promoted to manager, only 81 women overall and 77 women of color get promoted.\n\nThis is what McKinsey senior partners Kweilin Ellingrud, Lareina Yee, and María del Mar Martínez call \"the broken rung,\" and its effects compound throughout women's careers, causing them to fall behind at the start and keeping them from catching up. In this groundbreaking book, the authors reveal the problem's underlying cause: while about half of a person's lifetime earnings come from education and half from work experience, men get more value from their experience than women do. It is also here, in one's work experience, that the solution lies: women need to build their \"experience capital\" to level the playing field and maximize their earning potential.\n\nThe book combines over a decade of research, personal conversations with more than fifty remarkable leaders, and the authors' own rich experiences as leaders at McKinsey.

A bestselling author and business guru tells how to improve job satisfaction and performance.\n\nIn his sixth fable, bestselling author Patrick Lencioni takes on a topic that almost everyone can relate to: job misery. Millions of workers, even those who have carefully chosen careers based on true passions and interests, dread going to work, suffering each day as they trudge to jobs that make them cynical, weary, and frustrated. It is a simple fact of business life that any job, from investment banker to dishwasher, can become miserable. Through the story of a CEO turned pizzeria manager, Lencioni reveals the three elements that make work miserable -- irrelevance, immeasurability, and anonymity -- and gives managers and their employees the keys to make any job more engaging.\n\nAs with all of Lencioni’s books, this one is filled with actionable advice you can put into effect immediately. In addition to the fable, the book includes a detailed model examining the three root causes of job misery and how they can be remedied. It covers the benefits of managing for job engagement within organizations -- increased productivity, greater retention, and competitive advantage -- and offers examples of how managers can use the applications in the book to deal with specific jobs and situations.\n\nPatrick Lencioni is President of The Table Group, a management consulting firm specializing in executive team development and organizational health.

But what about those crucial times when accepting the obvious trade-off just isn't good enough? What do we do when the choices in front of us don't get us what we need? In those cases, rather than choosing the least worst option, we can use the models in front of us to create a new and superior answer. This is integrative thinking.\n\nFirst introduced by world-renowned strategic thinker Roger Martin in The Opposable Mind, integrative thinking is an approach to problem solving that uses opposing ideas as the basis for innovation.

But even with all the leadership training programs and \"expert\" advice available, effective leadership still eludes many people and organizations. One reason, says Daniel Goleman, is that such experts offer advice based on inference, experience, and instinct, not on quantitative data. Now, drawing on research of more than 3,000 executives, Goleman explores which precise leadership behaviors yield positive results. He outlines six distinct leadership styles, each one springing from different components of emotional intelligence. Each style has a distinct effect on the working atmosphere of a company, division, or team, and, in turn, on its financial performance. Coercive leaders demand immediate compliance. Authoritative leaders mobilize people toward a vision. Affiliative leaders create emotional bonds and harmony. Democratic leaders build consensus through participation. Pacesetting leaders expect excellence and self-direction. And coaching leaders develop people for the future. The research indicates that leaders who get the best results don't rely on just one leadership style; they use most of the styles in any given week. Goleman details the types of business situations each style is best suited for, and he explains how leaders who lack one or more of these styles can expand their repertories. He maintains that with practice leaders can switch among leadership styles to produce powerful results, thus turning the art of leadership into a science.\n\nThe Harvard Business Review Classics series offers you the opportunity to make seminal Harvard Business Review articles a part of your permanent management library.

It's not that your boss is out to get you. In fact, bosses generally mean well. But clueless leadership from a well-intentioned boss can sometimes cause more damage than a criminal mastermind tying your project to the railroad tracks.The Unwritten Rules of Managing Up provides refreshingly practical and candid insight into the best practices and techniques that project managers have successfully used for decades to manage a wide variety of senior-level stakeholders—ranging from perfectly competent and pleasant to downright dysfunctional and inept. While managing up is an incredibly valuable skill for virtually any type of boss (not just the difficult ones), the book includes recommendations for managing six particularly challenging—and common—types of senior leaders.

Bestselling author Peter Block is a true visionary: author of the classic Flawless Consulting, his work is about empowerment, stewardship, chosen accountability, and reconciliation of community. In this book, he returns his eye toward management to renew our efforts to create a shift in the traditional hierarchy. Twenty years after the original book, Block talks of why it is so difficult to both open the door to empowerment and more importantly, have people walk through it. It is more important than ever to create a culture in which all members of an organization are treated as entrepreneurs, giving them ownership over their role and responsibilities. This is in the face of the reality that most employees want safety, not the adventure of empowerment.\n\nPeter enhances the first edition of the book by acknowledging employees wish for dependency. Their longing for the days when a job carried a promise of a future, and companies cared more about the product and the people, than about the money.\n\nThis is written primarily for people in the middle. Good managers and employees who care more about doing good work and treating people right, than ambition and making it into the ruling class.

Her Optimal Motivation process shows leaders how to move people away from dependence on external rewards and help them discover how their jobs can meet the deeper psychological needs—for autonomy, relatedness, and competence—that science tells us result in meaningful and sustainable motivation. Optimal Motivation has been proven in organizations all over the world—Fowler's clients include Microsoft, CVS, NASA, the Catholic Leadership Institute, H&R Block, Mattel, and dozens more.

They're leaders like Zappos's Tony Hsieh and the late Steve Jobs, who've built cultures energized at every level to innovate, grow, and succeed.

There's no room for downtime, waste, or inefficiency. You have to do more with less. And employees have become high maintenance. Not only are they more likely to disagree openly and push back, but they also won't work hard for vague promises of long-term rewards. They look to you—their immediate boss—to help them get what they need and want at work.\n\nHow do you tackle this huge management challenge? If you are like most managers, you take a hands-off approach. You \"empower\" employees by leaving them alone, unless they really need you. After all, you don't want to \"micromanage\" them and don't have the time to hold every employee's hand. Of course, problems always come up and often snowball into bigger problems. In fact, you probably spend too much of your time solving problems and falling behind on your work . . . which leaves even less time for managing people . . . which opens the door for even more problems!\n\nIn It's Okay to Be the Boss, Bruce Tulgan puts his finger on the biggest problem in corporate America—an undermanagement epidemic affecting managers at all levels of the organization and in all industries—and offers another way.

Kim Barnes's unique process of constructive debate shows how teams can create better ideas and outcomes by eliminating obstacles to honest discussion, creativity, and collaboration. In too many organizations, great ideas and unusual solutions can be suppressed, ignored, or attacked. Departments defend their turf, and people choose what is safe over what is better. Bad ideas move forward and good ideas die, which can lead to disastrous results—financial or otherwise. Luckily, there is a workable path out of this dysfunction. Kim Barnes's process of constructive debate shows how to establish conditions that encourage the free exchange, discussion, and development of ideas and eliminate conditions that prevent potentially useful ideas from getting heard. By using this tested model, any company or team can improve outcomes and bring out everyone's best ideas.A constructive debate is one in which a diverse group of individuals can express their ideas, engage others in building on and improving them, explore ideas deeply, and challenge one another's positions in a fair and productive way.

But the vast majority of culture efforts fail as quickly as they started. Why? Because leaders are creating and communicating organizational values, but they’re failing to connect those values to their behaviors, processes, and practices of the organization.\n\nReCulturing is the playbook for building a business in which employees are clear on the why, what, and how they are working. ReCulturing is not a one-time change effort because culture is not something we ultimately have, but rather something we do. One of today’s most renowned thought leaders and practitioners on the issue, Melissa Daimler provides a modern definition of culture that is more of a verb than a noun. Culture needs to be reviewed consistently, just like strategy and purpose. Focusing on these three areas leads to higher performance and engagement. In the pages of this book, you’ll learn:\n\nA powerful framework for designing and evolving organizational culture that goes beyond values to also include behaviors, processes, and practices.\nHow to embed behaviors into core people processes like hiring, onboarding, talent managing, offboarding, strategizing and decision making\nHow to integrate “why you work” “what you do” and “how you do it” into an employee experience\nWhy it’s crucial to make sure a company’s practices evolve as the company changes\nThe book also features illuminating real-life stories recounting what has and hasn't worked at some of today's largest and most influential companies.Whether you’re launching a startup, running a global firm, or overseeing the shift to a hybrid work setting, ReCulturing provides everything you need to the kind of culture that drives long-term business success.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Culture in Business"]},{"id":"9781523092420","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"The Language of Leadership","authors":["Joel Schwartzberg"],"pages":"168","publication_date":"July 2021","description":"The impression you make as a leader has the power to build, enhance, or sabotage your authority and ideas.

Written by a leading employment lawyer in a refreshingly unlawyerly style, this guide takes the reader through the always-risky process of letting an employee go. Many employers and managers are afraid to pull the trigger when the employment relationship has broken down, and will postpone the decision by using progressive discipline and performance-improvement plans. However, an employer must be able to unload employees who threaten to undermine the company and its prospects, regardless of the risks involved in a termination. This book explains how to do it, how not to do it, and how to minimize the danger of an expensive employee lawsuit.\n\nNo one said being an employer or a manager was easy. Fortunately, knowing how to fire employees will make your job much, much easier in the long run and save you heartache. Firing at Will teaches you what you need to know, without any legalese or boring recitations of statutes and case law. This book is filled with plain-English common sense, based on Jay Shepherd's 17 years of protecting employers in court.

And why are so many of our assumptions about teams wrong?Business challenges like this one mimic many of the issues facing sports teams, though admittedly the sports metaphors most commonly used in business are trite and superficial comparisons.

While sustainability has been commonly misconstrued as a description of a set of problems, Christoph Lueneburger shows that it is really a solution to problems, capable of inspiring people and forging cultures.Sharing his exclusive, in-depth dialogues with chief sustainability officers, CEOs, and board chairmen, Lueneburger reveals how sustainability works at places where it works best, including Chrysler, Unilever, TNT, Walmart, and Bloomberg. Featuring a clear three-phase process that helps leaders assess the talent needed to develop organizations characterized by energy, resilience, and openness, A Culture of Purpose offers leaders the right questions to ask in order to:\n\nTap and Nurture Your Current Corporate Strengths: Learn how to recognize, cultivate, and leverage the competencies of your current talent to develop your leadership team.\n\nHire the Right Team: Ask the right questions to identify the innate personality traits in potential new hires, regardless of level and function, to bring on board those most likely to succeed in and shape your organization.\n\nCraft Your Culture: Create an environment that unleashes these competencies and traits and pushes them to the fore. Shape how people relate to one another and collectively go for what would be out of reach to them individually.\n\nMany books have described the \"what\" and the \"how\" of sustainability, but this is the first to reveal the \"who.\" Lueneburger changes dated preconceptions to show that sustainability is not an ideological mindset but a cultural trait of a resilient business. For leaders ready to build and strengthen a winning business, A Culture of Purpose is an education, a revelation, and an invitation to the next generation of success.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781633691841","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Leadership Transitions and Team Building: Leadership Collection (2 Books)","authors":["Harvard Business Review","Michael D.

But today, followers can be handed questionable policies and orders that come from many levels above them—even from the other side of the world. Chaleff explores how they can respond effectively, particularly using the power now available through advances in communications technology.Everyone is a follower at least some of the time. Chaleff strips away the passive connotations of that role and provides tools to help followers effectively partner with leaders.

Rather than a formulaic managerial approach to leadership, Lead with Wisdom presents the case for leadership based on our shared humanity and the stories that unite us. What emerges is a model of leadership based on learning to read key patterns of human experience: the way language shapes our reality, how we form new meaning through conversation, how relationships determine influence and how we deal with uncertainty.\n\nIt presents readers with the tools and illustrated examples to implement the four arts of leading wisely: how to draw out and create a new story in the organization, how to find and leverage the brilliance of people, how to speak with promise to restore meaning and hope, and how to show grace in dealing with the most demanding people and circumstances.\n\nOffers a leadership approach rooted in our shared humanity and the stories which unite and define us\n\nIdeal for corporate leaders, middle managers, administrators, and anyone else with management responsibilities\n\nWritten by a popular speaker on leadership and the author of Arts of the Wise Leader, with personal CEO experience and a PhD in the history of ideas\n\nStructured as one key idea per page or double page spread with funky line drawings supporting the concepts and skills\n\nFor anyone who wants to lead with wisdom, integrity, and humanity, Lead with Wisdom offers a welcome alternative to traditionally robotic and formulaic leadership strategies.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781604918144","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Evolving Leaders: A Model for Promoting Leadership Development in Programs","authors":["Charles J.

Storerooms full of extra stock \"in case we need it.\" Marketing money sprayed in all directions in the vain hope it will create customers. Duplicate IT systems. HR policies that fatten the corporate waistline rather than keeping it trim. Budgeting exercises that result in \"more of the same, plus 2%.\"\n\nNearly every corner of most established businesses harbors waste—wasted money, time, effort, or all three. As any runner can tell you, a lean body runs faster and wins races. The same goes when it comes to the competitive race all businesses engage in. Lean companies innovate faster, market more effectively, operate more smoothly, and achieve greater profitability.\n\nEliminating Waste in Business: Run Lean, Boost Profitability highlights common ways that businesses across all industries waste money without realizing it. Taking an analytical, hands-on view, this book challenges universally accepted business practices—some even taught in business schools—by pointing out how these practices drive waste, and then showing how to eliminate it and reap the benefits.\n\nIn eight meaty chapters, operations expert Dave J. Orr, and sales and marketing authority Linda M. Orr, tackle some of the obvious and easy-to-get-rid-of organizational fat and time wasters (meetings, anyone?) that for whatever reason many managers are blind to. They'll also show you how to employ lean six sigma and other methods to improve operational processes, inventory management, and more. But this book goes beyond these things and covers such areas as marketing and advertising spending, headcount and personnel administration, finance, and the many categories that make up what is in many companies a bloated monster: overhead.\n\nWith an emphasis on employing technology and smart management to drive down costs, this book will take a comprehensive view of the broad spectrum of money and time wasters and show you how to get rid of them once and for all.\n\nWhat you'll learn\n\nThe areas in which companies waste the most resources\n\nHow \"established practice\" drives businesses and business leaders to waste money\n\nHow to distinguish waste from value\n\nHow to avoid cutting bone and muscle along with waste\n\nHow to use various analytical and technical tools to eliminate waste\n\nHow to use technology to drive down costs in all areas\n\nHow to calculate ROI in each business category and improve it by doing more with less\n\nWho this book is for\n\nEliminating Waste in Business is designed for any business leader from basic supervisors to C-Suite executives. The concepts will apply to all managers, including those in nonprofit and government positions, and those in any industry or sector. A secondary market for this book is MBA students. Students often learn commonly accepted business and human resource practices in MBA courses, but they have no idea that, in the real world, many of these practices create waste.","tags":["Business","Project & Product Management","Product Management","Lean"]},{"id":"9781259588679","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Leading the Malcolm Baldrige Way: How World-Class Leaders Align Their Organizations to Deliver Exceptional Results","authors":["Kay Kendall","Glenn Bodinson"],"pages":"256","publication_date":"December 2016","description":"The definitive guide to implementing Baldrige Criteria in any organization—from the team that has worked with 18 Malcolm Baldrige Award winners\n\nFor organizations in both the public and private sectors, the coveted Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award is the gold standard to which all leaders aspire.

Warner"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"November 2010","description":"Strategy and strategic planning at the firm level often gets a bad reputation because managers aren't trained in it and the tools are unfamiliar, infrequently used and often poorly applied. The outcomes of these efforts can therefore be incomplete, biased, and far too subjective -- and the results disappointing. One purpose of this book is to overcome this problem of familiarity by developing a systematic approach to conducting a strategic analysis. From assessing the general industry environment to analyzing industry forces and firm resources, well known models are introduced and explained. This culminates in selecting a strategy that is consistent with industry and firm specific conditions. Another problem is that the entire strategic process might seem fruitless, especially if it is treated as an episodic or occasional task. If the result of all that work is a document that gets put on a shelf or in a closet, what is the point? The second purpose of this book is to develop the idea that strategic development is a broad based and ongoing process. Strategy may ultimately be the responsibility of the CEO but it needs (and benefits) from the engagement of others. Done right, that engagement and development aligns the organization more effectively. In addition, the models connect to and reinforce each other. To use them well requires reflection and revision. In short, the process is not ever completely done - it becomes less an end than a shared way of looking at the world.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Strategic Thinking"]},{"id":"9780874254808","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Manager's Pocket Guide to Dealing with Conflict","authors":["Lois B.

Countless books, articles, and seminars provide business leaders all the information they need to understand how lean works and how effective it can be when fully implemented. Again, not a secret. Why, then, do companies invariably fail in their pursuit of operational excellence?\n\nThe same reason people fail to trim fat through exercise. They don’t do it. They try to squeeze it into their schedule; they don’t make it part of their schedule. And, inevitably, it becomes less of a priority. In the same vein, too many business leaders see process improvement as a project, something separate from the more “pressing” goals of profits and growth. \n\nThat’s where they go wrong. And that’s where Building the Fit Organization comes in.\n\nIn this practical, hands-on guide Markovitz walks you step by step through the process of making lean as intrinsic to your company as the pursuit of profits.

Not according to the authors of Senior Leadership Teams. \n\nThey argue that in today's world of neck-snapping change, demands on leaders in top roles are rapidly outdistancing the capabilities of any one person - no matter how talented. Result? Chief executives are turning to their enterprise's senior leaders for help. Yet many CEOs stumble when creating a leadership team. \n\nOne major challenge is that senior executives often focus more on their individual roles than on the top team's shared work. Without the CEO's careful attention to setting the team up correctly, these high-powered managers often have difficulty pulling together to move their organization forward. Sometimes they don't even agree about what constitutes the right path forward. The authors explain how to determine whether your organization needs a senior leadership team. Then, drawing on their study of 100+ top teams from around the world, they explain how to create a clear and compelling purpose for your team, get the right people on it, provide structure and support, and sharpen team members' competencies - and your own. \n\nTimely and practical, this book enables you to create and sustain a leadership team whose members learn from one another while collaborating to pursue your company's objectives.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781604914917","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Leadership in Action: The Necessity of Optimism","authors":["Kristen Scott"],"pages":"2","publication_date":"January 1999","description":"Optimists explain bad events in less permanent, pervasive, and personal terms than pessimists do.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781562865139","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Organizational Coaching: Building Relationships and Programs that Drive Results","authors":["Virginia Bianco-Mathis","Cynthia Roman","Lisa Nabors"],"pages":"144","publication_date":"August 2008","description":"Workplace Learning Professionals need to add coaching to their toolkit of strategies and skills.

Organizational Coaching fills the void in coaching literature by providing instructions for organizations, distinguishing organizational coaching from the more widely known 'life coaching.' Full of tips, advice, checklists and assessments, the authors explain how to reach a desirable coaching outcome and create a successful coaching program. The presented model for organizational coaching is easily adapted to any individual or organization.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Executive Coaching"]},{"id":"9781843122852","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Leadership and SEN","authors":["Burnett"],"pages":"100","publication_date":"June 2013","description":"How can leaders turn their schools into outward looking centres of excellence?

It will surprise few professionals working in software development today to read that teams and teamwork are critical ingredients of a global economy. Productivity, product development and release, and even a company's survival increasingly will depend on teams to solve business problems. What may come as a surprise -- and a wake-up call -- is that, in many businesses, teams are completely ineffective. One reason, posits William E. Perry in iTeam: Putting the \"I\" Back into Team, is that most organizations put too much emphasis on joint effort, removing responsibility, ownership, and reward from individuals appointed to teams. What typically results is dysfunctional, essentially leaderless, and lacking in motivation. Perry's call to put the emphasis back on individual responsibility among collaborating teammates is an urgent one. Decisions now made by management will more and more frequently be made and implemented by teams, making it necessary for organizations to ensure that the creativity and innovative methods of individuals be retained on teams. Through extensive team experience and interviews with hundreds of individuals who have spent thousands of hours in team meetings, Perry has identified the attributes of great teams and great teamwork. iTeam examines the ten biggest challenges standing between most teams and excellence and explores in depth the fifty best practices teams can employ to improve performance. Concluding that world-class teams comprise individuals who do what is right for their organization, and do what is right the right way, iTeam presents a clear, practical argument for building teams that have at their core a strong, proven leader who encourages and motivates team members to fulfill their team responsibilities. Topics include: Reengineering the Team Approach to Problem Solving The Top-Ten Challenges to Effective Teamwork Selecting a Team Leader Who Will Lead Defining Team Entrance and Exit Criteria Selecting Team Members for Specific Roles Building Trust Among Team Members Training Team Members to Accomplish Their Assignments Listening to the Voice of the Customer Breaking Down Silos Avoiding Groupthink Assuring That Team Efforts Are Successful Rewarding Individual Team Members Keeping Teamwork Competitive Emerging Team Practices and much more","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management"]},{"id":"9781119287575","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Future-Proof Workplace","authors":["Linda Sharkey","Morag Barrett","Marshall Goldsmith"],"pages":"240","publication_date":"March 2017","description":"Face the future on the crest of the wave while the rest are pulled under\n\nThe Future-Proof Workplace is a survival guide for the new realities of business.

CAN YOU REALLY LEARN TO LEAD?\n\nYou might believe that leaders are born, not made. Perhaps you think that you need to hold an important job to be a leader—that you need permission to lead. Leadership is one of the most important aspects of our society. Yet there is enormous disagreement and confusion about what leadership means and whether it can really be learned.\n\nAs leadership expert Robert Steven Kaplan explains in this powerful new book, leadership qualities are not something you either have or you don’t. Leadership is not a destination or a state of being. Leadership is about what you do, rather than who you are, and it starts with an ownership mind-set. For Kaplan, learning to lead involves three key elements:\n\nThinking like an owner\nA willingness to act on your beliefs\nA relentless focus on adding value to others\n\nKaplan compellingly argues that great organizations are built around a nucleus of people who think and act with an ownership mind-set. He believes that leadership is not a role reserved only for those blessed with the right attributes or situated in the right positions of power. Leadership is accessible to each of us—today. It requires a process of hard work, willingness to ask questions, and openness to learning.\n\nThis book aims to demystify leadership and outlines a specific regimen that will empower you to build your leadership skills. Kaplan tells real-life stories from his own experience of working with various types of leaders seeking to improve their effectiveness and make their organizations more successful. He asks probing questions, provides exercises, and suggests concrete follow-up steps that will help you develop your skills, create new habits, and move you toward reaching your unique leadership potential.\n\nWhat You Really Need to Lead will help you develop your capacity to lead by unlocking your power to think and act like an owner.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9780080554822","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Positive Working Relationships Revised Edition","authors":["Elearn"],"pages":"120","publication_date":"November 2009","description":"Stuck for ideas, inspiration or just want to work differently?

These manageable steps include:\n\nIdentify the area in your business or life where a gap exists between your current reality and your desired reality\n\nAlign yourself with a person or a group of people who can commit to holding you accountable for closing the gap\n\nMake a specific commitment to the outcome(s) you want and assign dates to them\n\nWith courageous leadership, you'll create a culture and a mindset that encourages and demands excellence! Follow these steps to bring out the best in your employees and lead your company to significant success.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781633691759","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Managing in the Gray","authors":["Joseph L.

And the hardest decisions are the gray areas”situations where you and your team have worked hard to find an answer, you’ve done the best analysis you can, and you still don’t know what to do. But you have to make a decision. You have to choose, commit, act, and live with the consequences and persuade others to follow your lead. Gray areas test your skills as a manager, your judgment, and even your humanity. How do you get these decisions right?In Managing in the Gray, Joseph Badaracco offers a powerful, practical, and even radical way to resolve these problems. Picking up where conventional tools of analysis leave off, this book provides tools for judgment in the form of five revealing questions. Asking yourself these five questions provides a simple yet profound way to broaden your thinking, sharpen your judgment, and develop a fresh perspective. What makes these questions so valuable is that they have truly stood the test of timethey’ve guided countless men and women, across many centuries and cultures, to resolve the hardest questions of work, responsibility, and life.You can use the five-question framework on your own or with others on your team to help you cut through complexities, understand critical trade-offs, and develop workable solutions for even the grayest issues.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Team Management"]},{"id":"9780749467739","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"The Lean Practitioner's Handbooks","authors":["Mark Eaton"],"pages":"328","publication_date":"February 2013","description":"A practical guide to the tools and concepts of Lean for anyone preparing, running or evaluating Lean events and activities.","tags":["Business","Project & Product Management","Product Management","Lean"]},{"id":"9781119331612","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"The Courageous Leader","authors":["Angela Sebaly"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"March 2017","description":"Tap into everyday courage for extraordinary results\n\nThe Courageous Leader presents a much-needed reminder for leaders everywhere: it takes courage.

In the business world, incident-driven, company position statements on Black Lives Matter or Stop Asian Hate are not proxies for the heavy lifting that will penetrate and sustain a shift in the status quo. Advancing racial equity to disrupt institutional racism requires more than a company-wide memo or a tab on a corporate website. Businesses often water down, negate or skirt this reality by touting successes from its cousin—diversity. However, you cannot advance a strategy you do not name. The general term “diversity” enables that dynamic. It’s impossible to create an antiracist workplace when we avoid speaking the words ``race” and “racism.” Co-authored by two business women, one Black and one White, The Business of Race can help us all prepare for this transformative work. Rather than diving headfirst with well-meaning but ineffectual efforts, we must first ready our organizations. The authors outline both the inner work (raising our own individual awareness and creating new ways of thinking and being), and the outer work organizations must undertake.

Ray took this as a challenge and, after months of hard training, became the fastest hurdler on the team. That drive and self-discipline is, to Zinn, the essence of the entrepreneurial spirit. It’s what pushed him to achieve the impossible, founding a Silicon Valley microchip company—without venture capital—and turning it into a global empire with an enviable 37-year track record as CEO.\n\nTough Things First, the distillation of Ray Zinn’s astonishing career as CEO of Micrel, is a comprehensive head-to-toe training program for entrepreneurs and leaders—based on hard-won lessons in business and in life.

He shows you how to be a good leader and what you can do to make yourself even better. He reveals why discipline is the first and most important step—for the entrepreneur and the organization—and why people are your single most valuable resource. He offers practical, no-nonsense advice on processes and procedures, finances and growth creation, changing markets and new technology. But that’s not all.\n\nThe key to your success, Zinn explains, lies in your mind, your body, your vision, and your heart.

In 37 years of leading this publicly traded microchip empire, he saw it through the dot-com bust and Great Recession—with only one unprofitable year—relying on his discipline as a leader, passion as an inventor, and training as an athlete.

But leadership underlies them all. And despite how important we know it is, we've been forced to rely on subjective and unreliable ways to measure its impact—until now.In this landmark book, leadership scholar, author, and consultant Dave Ulrich proposes a “leadership capital index”—a Moody's or Standard and Poor's rating for leadership. Drawing on research from investors and business leaders, and synthesizing the work of dozens of consulting firms and leadership experts, Ulrich analyzes two broad domains, each comprising five factors. The individual domain includes personal qualities, strategic prowess, execution proficiency, interpersonal skills, and fit between the leader's style and the organization's market promises. The organizational domain encompasses a leader's ability to create customer-focused cultures, manage talent, demand accountability, use information to gain competitive advantage, and set up work processes to deal with change. Ulrich details rigorous metrics and methods for evaluating leaders on each of these factors. The result is a groundbreaking book that will be of vital interest not only to equity and debt investors but also to boards of directors, executive teams, human resource and leadership development professionals, government and ratings agencies—and of course to leaders themselves.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781394171736","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The End of Leadership as We Know It","authors":["Steve Garcia","Dan Fisher"],"pages":"256","publication_date":"August 2023","description":"Maximize your leadership impact with the latest insights and research from the field of adaptive leadership\n\nIn The End of Leadership as We Know It, a team of veteran executive and leadership strategists delivers an expert analysis of the ten most common errors leaders make when attempting to address disruption and concrete strategies for avoiding them.

Empirical research into this subject has been sparse. Responsible Leadership, by Nicholas Clarke, Alessia D’Amato, Malcolm Higgs, and Ramesh Vahidi is the first study to investigate how the relationships among managers, team members, and other stakeholders can bring about personal and ethical conflicts that impact decision making.\n\nIn this groundbreaking book, the authors explore how those who serve as leaders on projects can exercise their roles in ways that respond to the ever-increasing need for ethical decision making. They examine the factors that enable and constrain responsible leadership, looking at the issues faced by project managers as they interact with team members and other stakeholders. Responsible Leadership also provides new insights into how project managers view the moral implications of conflicts that occur as they conduct their work and is a valuable addition to the project management toolkit.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781950496280","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Know-How","authors":["Harold D.

Historically there has been a slowness to acknowledge the risks which social workers routinely face and some employers have adopted a re-active approach, waiting for incidents to occur before taking action. They are thus placed in the position of having to make policy 'on the hoof' and at a time of crisis. Support to staff who have been attacked has been patchy, and in some instances sadly lacking. The absence of agreed procedures for dealing with violent attacks can leave the staff concerned, feeling unsupported, anxious and stressed. Social work staff, in their turn, may have experienced feelings of guilt when they have been unable to prevent aggression or assault; at best they may lack confidence in the level of understanding and support their line managers will show, and at worst they may feel that they will be blamed for the incident. As a result there is a tendency towards under reporting violent acts. For these reasons a joint approach to the problem is urged which involves social workers, support staff and managers. Personal Safety for Social Workers examines the special issues which social workers, and their employers, need to address. Part 1 reviews some of the information now available about violence in social work settings and within the context of violence in society at large. The respective roles and responsibilities of employers and employees are discussed, and guidance offered on developing a workplace personal safety policy and on the steps which will need to be taken for effective implementation. Advice is given on developing procedures for reporting violent incidents and for providing after-care to staff who have been on the receiving end of violence. This section of the book also looks at the ways in which the design and management of the workplace can enhance personal safety and provides guidelines to social workers on the issues to consider when working away","tags":["Business","Project & Product Management","Product Management","Lean"]},{"id":"9781637424292","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Improv to Improve Your Leadership Team","authors":["Candy Campbell"],"pages":"178","publication_date":"April 2023","description":"“It’s my hope you’ll enjoy Improv to Improve Your Leadership Team as much as I did.

They are trying to prevent the next Rana Plaza factory collapse, the next Deepwater Horizon explosion, the next Foxconn labor abuses. Obviously, they don’t always succeed. Christine Bader was one of those people. She loved BP and then-CEO John Browne’s lofty rhetoric on climate change and human rights—until a string of fatal BP accidents, Browne’s abrupt resignation under a cloud of scandal, and the start of Tony Hayward’s tenure as chief executive, which would end with the Deepwater Horizon disaster. Bader’s story of working deep inside the belly of the beast is unique in its details, but not in its themes: of feeling like an outsider both inside the company (accused of being a closet activist) and out (assumed to be a corporate shill); of getting mixed messages from senior management; of being frustrated with corporate life but committed to pushing for change from within. The Evolution of a Corporate Idealist: When Girl Meets Oil is based on Bader’s experience with BP and then with a United Nations effort to prevent and address human rights abuses linked to business. Using her story as its skeleton, Bader weaves in the stories of other “Corporate Idealists” working inside some of the world’s biggest and best-known companies.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Culture in Business"]},{"id":"9781119261681","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Managing the Millennials, 2nd Edition","authors":["Chip Espinoza","Mick Ukleja"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"May 2016","description":"The Builders, Baby Boomers, Generation X, and Millennials—all make up workforces in every type of industry all over the world.

Great leaders and achievers the masters, innovators, and great ones - do not owe their success to luck, birth, or environment and mindless risk taking. Rather, insight, achievement, and leadership are not the result of happenstance but of self-knowledge, training, and hard work. According to authors Swartz and Thorpe, great achievers throughout history from Michelangelo to Einstein, Madame Curie to Bill Gates, Colonel Sanders to General Eisenhower all have leadership characteristics that can be distilled into 10 key actions for extraordinary success. None of it is easy, the authors say, but following these keys to success can bring substantial rewards in every facet of life. The first keys or actions involve finding great opportunities determining one s passions and distinctive capabilities, the importance of learning, envisioning opportunities, and leveraging opportunities. The second set of actions involves mobilizing support for your ideas by understanding the complexity of and resistance to change, and thee final keys cover how to design, plan, and execute to opportunities while simultaneously developing achievement in others. In the process of exploring what differentiates extraordinary achievers from others, the authors put to rest some long-held and passionately defended notions. Mozart, for example, was not a buffoon who composed some of the world s most beloved music unthinkingly. And Madame Curie was a trained physicist, not just the technician wife of a great man. Michelangelo, arguably one of the greatest artists, engineers, and visionaries in the Western world, is especially interesting; his sculpture of David and the David and Goliath story is a central metaphor for authors: David represents everyone who goes beyond fear, who pursues a higher mission, who puts the interests of others first. David also is an inspiration to us to search for our Davids in the stone or to help other people and organizations see theirs.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781118464731","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Accelerating Leadership Development: Practical Solutions for Building Your Organization's Potential","authors":["Jocelyn Bérard"],"pages":"320","publication_date":"August 2013","description":"Proven strategies and innovative solutions for developing and retaining successful leaders\n\nMany organizations today are facing a crisis of leadership.

Cramer shows leaders how to apply ABT to shift their attention away from what is negative and learn to intentionally shine the spotlight on the positive, beneficial facts of a situation. As they make this mental shift from negative to positive aspects, they improve their optimism, empathy, and confidence. When their mindset zooms in on what is strong, valuable, and possible, what they say and do is far more likely to inspire others to action. In short, ABT helps leaders shift internally so they can excel externally.

These strategies address the evolving workplace: flexible, fast-moving, delayered, virtual, unstable, out-of-balance, ambiguous, global, diverse, and ruthlessly competitive. Here are actionable tools and strategies to help you build your workplace on a new standard of honest, ethical behavior, along with informative case studies that examine the behavior of both ethical and unethical companies.\n\nToday’s climate of corporate cultural disorder needs a new type of leader, men and women who replace confusion with order, opaqueness with clarity, complexity with simplicity, hopelessness with confidence, greed with selflessness, and suspicion with trust. The common-sense prescriptions offered in The Decency Code can help you become the type of leader you wish to be—and effect the change you wish to see. This book is required reading for ethically conscious managers everywhere.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781119906650","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Alive and Well at the End of the Day, 2nd Edition","authors":["Paul D.

As one of the world’s top trainers in the field of accelerated experiential learning, Ron Roberts understands this more keenly than anyone, and in The Well-Balanced Leader, he helps you re-envision your own behavior to become the best leader you can be.\n\nRoberts makes the process of finding the perfect leadership balance—what he calls egolibrium—personally enriching and easy to achieve. He begins by identifying the nine human behavioral dichotomies that most affect the quality of leadership:\n\nNonjudgmental / Judgmental\nNondefensive / Defensive\nRelinquishing Control / Controlling\nOpenness to learning / Know it all\nDoing the right thing / Doing whatever you want\nPatience / Impatience\nLetting go / Holding on\nAcceptance / Resistance\nOther-centric / Egocentric\n\nEveryone’s behaviors fall somewhere between each dichotomy. Using the activities, action steps, games, and thought exercises included for each pair, you’ll figure out exactly where your behaviors land, and then learn how to move that position in one direction or the other to find the right balance or your specific needs.\n\nWhen you transcend your personal needs and focus on the needs of others and of the organization, everyone benefits—including you. The result is not only greater job satisfaction for people at all levels, but greater productivity— regardless of the organization’s field, product, or service.\n\nThe Well-Balanced Leader gives you the tools for making the small, incremental changes in behavior that lead to big changes in awareness—and huge changes in your leadership effectiveness.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781606494561","language":"en","level":null,"title":"Academic Ethos Management","authors":["Agata Stachowicz-Stanusch"],"pages":"288","publication_date":"December 2012","description":"This topical and much needed book constitutes an important part of the debate on the integrity in an academic context as a sine qua non of responsible management education.

Robert Quinn shows how to defy convention and create organizations where people feel fully engaged and continually rewarded, where both individually and collectively they flourish and exceed expectations.The problem is that leaders are following a negative and constraining “mental map” that insists organizations must be rigid, top-down hierarchies and that the people in them are driven mainly by self-interest and fear. But leaders can adopt a different mental map, one where organizations are networks of fluid, evolving relationships and where people are motivated by a desire to grow, learn, and serve a larger goal. Using dozens of memorable stories, Quinn describes specific actions leaders can take to facilitate the emergence of this organizational culture—helping people gain a sense of purpose, engage in authentic conversations, see new possibilities, and sacrifice for the common good. The book includes the Positive Organization Generator, a tool that provides 100 real-life practices from positive organizations and helps you reinvent them to fit your specific needs.

Ellen Peebles"],"pages":"9","publication_date":"October 2015","description":"A survey of top business executives from major international organizations found that 79% said it was extremely important to have leaders who act on behalf of the entire organization, not just their units. The rest said it was very important. Nearly 65% said they expected at least half of their senior and midlevel managers to behave as enterprise leaders — that is, executives who are as successful at serving the needs of the enterprise as they are at growing the units they head. The expectation that managers will know what’s happening elsewhere in the enterprise is rising, authors Douglas A. Ready and M. Ellen Peebles write, but few organizations have been set up to support the development of such enterprise leaders.\n\nSo how are managers learning to become effective enterprise leaders, and how can organizations encourage their development? The authors surveyed and interviewed scores of executives from the Americas, Europe, and Asia, and focused on three companies: Pfizer, Li & Fung, and Unilever. They found that regardless of the business or the location, enterprise leaders developed their capabilities in similar ways — through a combination of deliberate personal development, high-level mentoring, and opportunities afforded by their work that enabled strong unit performers to become even more effective as enterprise leaders.\n\nAccording to the authors, the essence of enterprise leadership lies in combining two often incompatible roles — those of builder and broker. That means executives need to build their unit’s vision and integrate it into the wider corporate vision, clarifying where the enterprise is going and how their teams can best contribute, both within and beyond unit boundaries. They must build unit capabilities and share resources and business know-how across units to contribute to enterprisewide organizational capability.\n\nBalancing the goals of the unit with the broader interests of the enterprise can be difficult, the authors concede. Having come up the ranks in silos, managers acquire strong building skills — not the brokering skills top leaders said they needed. From their interviews, the authors identified six components of what they present as a mindset for the successful enterprise leader: a heightened sense of place; a broad sense of context; a sharp sense of perspective; a powerful sense of community; a deep sense of purpose; and an abiding sense of resiliency.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9780730330059","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Work with Me","authors":["Simon Dowling"],"pages":"200","publication_date":"November 2016","description":"Lead from any level with the power of buy-in\n\nWork with Me shows you how to master the art of the 'buy-in.'

The protagonist, Adam, is capable and well-meaning but has confidence bordering on hubris, and blind spots that could be the end of him. That is, until unlikely encounters with a park ranger and a home handyman, who become confidants and mentors, reveal new insights to Adam.

Harley-Davidson is still the great, iconic American motorcycle. But like many storied companies, Harley has had to evolve to stay on top, even to stay in existence. From near-extinction in the early eighties, it has risen to worldwide recognition for management excellence and innovation. The Lean Machine is an inside look at how Harley-Davidson was able to adapt in an ever-changing world and accelerate product development. Rooted in Japanese productivity improvement techniques, Knowledge-Based Product Development helped fuel Harley’s incredible period of sustained growth. Even after the company earned the PDMA Corporate Innovator Award in 2003, Dantar Oosterwal, a Harley-Davidson executive, took the improvement a quantum leap further. By implementing Lean Product Development techniques, Harley realized an unprecedented fourfold increase in throughput in half the time, powering annual growth of more than ten percent. In The Lean Machine, Oosterwal shows the day-to-day transformation at Harley and identifies universal change and improvement issues, so that companies in any industry can incorporate Knowledge-Based Innovation—with predictably excellent results.","tags":["Business","Project & Product Management","Product Management","Lean"]},{"id":"9781492038443","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Building an awesome team culture","authors":["Ben Collins-Sussman","Brian W.

There may be no greater waste of a company’s resources. The ultimate cost: neither the organization nor its people are able to realize their full potential. What if a company did everything in its power to create a culture in which everyone—not just select “high potentials”—could overcome their own internal barriers to change and use errors and vulnerabilities as prime opportunities for personal and company growth?Robert Kegan and Lisa Lahey (and their collaborators) have found and studied such companies—Deliberately Developmental Organizations. A DDO is organized around the simple but radical conviction that organizations will best prosper when they are more deeply aligned with people’s strongest motive, which is to grow. This means going beyond consigning “people development” to high-potential programs, executive coaching, or once-a-year off-sites. It means fashioning an organizational culture in which support of people’s development is woven into the daily fabric of working life and the company’s regular operations, daily routines, and conversations.An Everyone Culture dives deep into the worlds of three leading companies that embody this breakthrough approach. It reveals the design principles, concrete practices, and underlying science at the heart of DDOs—from their disciplined approach to giving feedback, to how they use meetings, to the distinctive way that managers and leaders define their roles. The authors then show readers how to build this developmental culture in their own organizations.This book demonstrates a whole new way of being at work. It suggests that the culture you create is your strategy—and that the key to success is developing everyone.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Culture in Business"]},{"id":"9781398617759","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Silent Rebellion","authors":["Chris Lewis","Inez Robinson-Odom"],"pages":"288","publication_date":"September 2024","description":"Understand why traditional leadership is struggling and find out how you can become a better leader.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781398608085","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Managing Employee Burnout","authors":["Shauna Moran"],"pages":"272","publication_date":"December 2022","description":"Support your employees and reduce burnout in the organization with this practical guide.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Team Management","Remote Work Management"]},{"id":"9780749460778","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Strategic Thinking, 3rd Edition","authors":["Simon Wootton","Terry Horne"],"pages":"160","publication_date":"July 2010","description":"Strategic Thinking: A Step-by-Step Approach to Strategy and Leadership is a practical workbook which takes the reader through the logical stages in strategic planning.

We allowed a narrative that is solely about earnings to replace what we know to be true about human motivation.\n\nHuman beings are hardwired to seek purpose, but according to data, most people don't feel a sense of purpose in their work. Work has become a grind, an endless series of tasks that lack meaning.\n\nBuilding upon her bestseller Selling with Noble Purpose, leadership expert Lisa Earle McLeod tackles the employee engagement crisis by showing leaders how to put workplace meaning front and center. McLeod, whose clients include organizations like Google, Hootsuite, and Roche, asserts that many organizations are unconsciously squandering their greatest asset—their people's passion. By putting profit before purpose, organizations eroded the very thing that makes a business great.\n\nThe narrative of profit, earnings, and bonuses was supposed to improve employee performance, but it had the opposite effect. It stripped the joy and meaning from work in ways that have a chilling effect on morale, performance, and ultimately profit.

Norton"],"pages":"320","publication_date":"April 2006","description":"Most organizations consist of multiple business and support units, each populated by highly trained, experienced executives. But often the efforts of individual units are not coordinated, resulting in conflicts, lost opportunities, and diminished performance. Robert S. Kaplan and David P. Norton argue that the responsibility for this critical alignment lies with corporate headquarters. In this book, the authors apply their revolutionary Balanced Scorecard management system to corporate-level strategy, revealing how highly successful enterprises achieve powerful synergies by explicitly defining corporate headquarters’ role in setting, coordinating, and overseeing organizational strategy. Based on extensive field research in organizations worldwide, Alignment shows how companies can build an enterprise-level Strategy Map and Balanced Scorecard that clearly articulate the “enterprise value proposition”: how the enterprise creates value above that achieved by individual business units operating alone. The book provides case studies, actionable frameworks, and sample scorecards that show how to align business and support units, boards of directors, and external partners with the corporate strategy and create a governance process that will ensure that alignment is sustained.The next breakthrough in strategy execution from the field’s premier thinkers, Alignment shows how today’s companies can unlock unrealized value from enterprise synergies.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Strategic Thinking"]},{"id":"53863MIT65208","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"How Ghost Scenarios Haunt Strategy Execution","authors":["Trudi Lang","Rafael Ramírez"],"pages":"7","publication_date":"October 2023","description":"Executives engaged in strategic planning tend to work with an implicit view of the future that is deeply embedded in their organization’s strategy as a set of unquestioned assumptions about the future business context.

Businesses and society endorse busyness, overwork, and extreme commitment as the most valued traits in workers. Sometimes that endorsement is explicit, as when Elon Musk told X/Twitter employees to work \"long hours at high intensity\" or get fired. More often it's an implicit contract, a buildup of organizational and cultural norms and the adoption of new technologies that make it easy to tether people to work.\n\nEither way, this workaholic behavior is unhealthy and counterproductive for workers and for organizations. It's time to fight back. Malissa Clark—a preeminent researcher on the culture of overwork—shows you how in Never Not Working. Clark examines overwork and burnout, not just from the individual's perspective but from an organizational perspective too. She delivers a comprehensive, nuanced definition of workaholism, busting myths along the way—working long hours, it turns out, doesn't automatically make you a workaholic. She also helps you assess whether you're falling prey to the phenomenon and whether you're creating workaholics in your organization.\n\nClark shows you how to escape the trap of putting work at the center of everything and thus losing your well-being—or your company's performance—in the process. Deeply researched and written for everyone from leaders to individual contributors, Never Not Working is the essential guide to identifying workaholism in yourself and others and starting on the road to recovery.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Culture in Business"]},{"id":"9781422131046","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Becoming a Resonant Leader","authors":["Annie McKee","Richard E.

Clark. “In fact, it's the most important applied discipline in the world.” The success of any organization can be traced directly to leadership. And leadership can be learned. But too many books and development programs focus exclusively on skills. In reality, performance and ultimate credibility are based on a combination of character and competence. As Clark puts it, character is the core and competence the crust. He shows how greatness emerges from a powerful combination of the two, although in the end character is more important. A leader with character but no competence will be ineffective, while a leader with competence but no character is dangerous.Clark spotlights the four most important components of character and competence and offers a series of eloquent, inspiring, and actionable reflections on what's needed to build each one. Fundamentally, he sees leadership as influence—leaders influence people “to climb, stretch, and become.” You need character to influence positively and competence to influence effectively. This is a book for anyone, no matter where he or she is on the organization chart. Because today employees at all levels are being asked to step up, not only can everyone be a leader, everyone has to be. Clark's insights are profound, and his passion is infectious. “Leadership” he writes, “is the most engaging, inspiring, and deeply satisfying activity known to humankind.

Roberto explains why \"good process entails the astute management of the social, political, and emotional aspects of decision making\" -- in other words, why effective leaders are well served by carefully \"deciding how to decide.\"\n\n¿\n\nKnow What You Don’t Know: How Great Leaders Prevent Problems Before They Happen lays out the key skills and capabilities required to ensure that problems do not remain hidden in your organization. It explains how leaders can become effective problem finders, unearthing problems before they destroy an organization. The book explains how leaders can become an anthropologist, going out and observing how employees, customers, and suppliers actually behave. It then goes on to present how they can circumvent the gatekeepers, so they can go directly to the source to see and hear the raw data; hunt for patterns, including refining your individual and collective pattern recognition capability; \"connect the dots\" among issues that may initially seem unrelated, but in fact, have a great deal in common; give front-line employees training in a communication technique; encourage useful mistakes, including creating a \"Red Pencil Award\"; and watch the game film, where leaders reflect systematically on their own organization's conduct and performance, as well as on the behavior and performance of competitors.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9780132563659","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Being a Caring Leader: Compassion and Forgiveness","authors":["Fred Kiel","Doug Lennick"],"pages":"11","publication_date":"September 2010","description":"This Element is an excerpt from Moral Intelligence: Enhancing Business Performance and Leadership Success (9780132349864) by Doug Lennick and Fred Kiel, Ph.D..

He knows his workers are talented and creative, but they don't respond to his efforts to lead them, and he's on the brink of being fired. In desperation, he reaches out to an old mentor, David Butler, who now works with wild mustang horses and hard-to-place foster children on a ranch in Colorado. David agrees to work with his former student but only on the condition that Matt comes to him—to the ranch. Matt has no idea what the ranch could possibly have to do with his problems, but David assures him that if he spends some time there, he'll learn exactly what he needs to know. Through David's unorthodox tutelage, Matt discovers that leaders who succeed in engaging their workers do so because they see their day-to-day work as an opportunity to build an organizational culture of engagement. The engagement model is illuminated as Matt comes to understand its components piece by piece—and ultimately discovers how to engage those on his team and in his life.In this inspiring leadership fable, John Stahl-Wert and Ken Jennings draw on their years of experience as consultants and chief executives, as well as on findings from Gallup's groundbreaking Q12 survey of 4 million workers from 360,000 workgroups, to lay out an innovative leadership model that will turn employees from dutiful drones to committed contributors.

They help to emphasize parts of the production process that add the most value and eliminate those that don’t. However, misplaced expectations can make implementation difficult and reduce the benefits. The authors argue that if managers better understood the rates at which lean programs produce improvements, then implementations would go more smoothly. Typically, the goal of a production system is to provide a clear and stable structure and a road map for instilling a culture of continuous improvement throughout a company’s production network. But, as the authors point out, every plant is different, and different plants are likely to face different sets of competitive and market conditions. For the growing number of multinational manufacturers that have introduced or are considering lean production systems, the issue is not whether the programs are useful but how to manage their implementation. The authors studied the implementation of the Volvo Group’s production system. (The company, a leading maker of trucks and other heavy vehicles, sold its car-manufacturing unit in 1999.) Volvo Group introduced the Volvo Production System in 2007, and since then, it has been implementing it in its factories around the world. The authors examined the five-year history of the Volvo Production System, visited 44 of Volvo’s 67 plants and interviewed 200 managers. The authors found that there were four distinct stages of change in the rate of performance improvement and that there was a strong relationship between a plant’s maturity in a production system implementation and its performance; progress roughly followed the shape of an S-curve. The pattern implies that a plant’s rate of improvement changes in the shape of a bell curve as the plant becomes more mature in implementing the production system. Performance improves slowly at first, and then at an increasing rate before the improvement rate gradually decreases. To measure the performance of the plants, the authors focused on nonfinancial metrics related to the quality, cost, delivery and safety of the plant’s output. They obtained this data from the company’s documents and during plant visits and interviews. They then used statistical methods to find patterns. Volvo’s assessment process provides a structure and a standard by which local managers can compare their plants with others. It also provides a mechanism for transferring expertise and best practices. The assessments have a strong symbolic impact: They communicate the company’s commitment to the production system. Implementing a production system is a long journey, but the authors conclude that it’s a worthwhile endeavor.","tags":["Business","Project & Product Management","Product Management","Lean"]},{"id":"9781604912050","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Leadership in Action: Fatal Attraction: The Dangers of Leaders Flocking Together","authors":["Shaker A.

In other words, to maintain excellence, the company must be in a constant state of flux!The book introduces the patterns and anti-patterns of excellence and includes detailed case studies based on different dimensions of variations, including shared values variations, structure variations, and staff variations. It presents these case studies through the prism of the \"variations\" idea to help you visualize the difference of the \"case history\" approach presented here. The case studies illustrate the different dimensions of business variations available to help your organization in its quest towards achieving and sustaining excellence.

Fines and settlements have amounted to billions of dollars.

Heineman, GE's chief legal officer and a member of both Jack Welch's and Jeff Immelt's senior management teams for nearly twenty years, reveals crucial \"performance with integrity\" principles and practices that you can begin applying immediately, and shows how you can drive performance by integrating integrity systems and processes deep into company operations.

Love is not only appropriate in the context of business, it’s the foundation of great leadership. To put it bluntly: love is just damn good business. That’s the simple but profound truth that leadership consultant Steve Farber has discovered in his extensive work with Fortune 100 companies and other successful businesses. His game-changing approach to love as a practical business strategy will help you to: • Identify your passions—and share them with others • Create a culture of love at work—and spark innovation, productivity, and joy • Serve your customers, so they love how you treat them—and have them coming back for more • Invest time in making personal connections—that are mutually rewarding • Focus on serving the needs of others—they’re going to love it • Do what you love—and make it your business, so others love it, too The proven principles you’ll find in this book will help you lay the groundwork for a thriving, competitive enterprise. When love is part of your organization’s framework and operationalized in its culture, employees and customers feel genuinely valued. Employees who are passionate about the work that they do are more loyal, innovative, creative, and inspired, and that translates to great customer experience. They don’t serve others out of obligation, but because of a genuine desire to improve people’s lives. And when customers reciprocate by loving your products, your services, and your people, that’s when something great happens. That’s when you get loyalty. That’s when you get raving fans. It’s a refreshingly human way of doing business. In addition to Farber’s field-tested strategies, you’ll find inspiring case studies from a wide range of industries and leaders, revealing self-assessment quizzes, and practical pointers on how to build a corporate culture based on love, the ultimate competitive advantage.

Using real-world stories, Schmaltz undermines the excuses that may be keeping you trapped in meaningless work, offering practical guidance for overcoming the inevitable difficulties of project work.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management"]},{"id":"9780273727538","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Leading in Turbulent Times","authors":["Kevin Kelly","Gary Hayes"],"pages":"192","publication_date":"September 2012","description":"What should senior managers do in the face of the unrelenting change that confronts them today?

Share bold and still-in-formation ideas? In this book, bestselling authors and inclusion experts Frederick A. Miller and Judith H. Katz introduce the concept of “interaction safety” and demonstrate how it can help create a work environment of trust, inclusion, and collaboration. Interaction safety encourages reasonable risk-taking and inspires every individual to be brave enough to reach for higher goals and more ambitious possibilities. When interaction safety exists, people know they will not be penalized, ostracized, demoted, made small, discounted, or shunned because of their thoughts, contributions, and conversations. Individuals feel encouraged, empowered, and can achieve more together than they would alone. Miller and Katz provide a four-level model for assessing and increasing the interaction safety in organizations, illustrated by short scenarios taken from real-life situations. They offer concrete actions team members, leaders, and organizations can take to build and maintain a productive, collaborative, and innovative environment in which people do their best work individually and collectively.When interaction safety is a way of life, the energy people used to spend walking on eggshells, trying to get their ideas heard, navigating minefields, or avoiding those they distrust can instead be put towards doing their best work and winning bigger for the organization.

They require diverse combinations of people, organizations, and sectors to coordinate actions and work together even when the way forward is unclear. Even so, collaborative efforts often fail because they attempt to navigate complexity with traditional strategic plans, created by hierarchies that ignore the way people naturally connect.By embracing a living-systems approach to organizing, impact networks bring people together to build relationships across boundaries; leverage the existing work, skills, and motivations of the group; and make progress amid unpredictable and ever-changing conditions. As a powerful and flexible organizing system that can span regions, organizations, and silos of all kinds, impact networks underlie some of the most impressive and large-scale efforts to create change across the globe. David Ehrlichman draws on his experience as a network builder; interviews with dozens of network leaders; and insights from the fields of network science, community building, and systems thinking to provide a clear process for creating and developing impact networks.

The book also reviews decision field theory and examines its implications for cross cultural decision making.\n\nWith increasing globalization of organizations and interactions among people from various cultures, a better understanding of how cultural factors influence decision making and action is a necessity. Much is known about decision processes, culture and cognition, design of products and interfaces for human interaction with machines and organizational processes, however this knowledge is dispersed across several disciplines and research areas. Presenting a range of current research and new ideas, this volume brings together previously scattered research and explores how to apply it when designing systems that will be used by individuals of varied backgrounds.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Culture in Business"]},{"id":"53863MIT64409","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Job, Career, or Purpose?","authors":["Charn P.

Roth"],"pages":"229","publication_date":"August 2014","description":"During the author’s decades of experience consulting in the corporate world and teaching management theory at the university level, he has often questioned many modern-day management practices. For example, why do so many companies have evaluation and reward systems that force employees to compete against each other while these same organizations preach the gospel of cooperation and teamwork? Why do companies continue to downsize when this practice has proven antithetical to long-term success?Out of the Box Thinking for Successful Managers explains, in a user-friendly and sometimes humorous manner, why these practices are based on worn-out logic in some cases and complete falsehoods in others. Questioning numerous management practices that have been popular for decades, it details their weaknesses and explains why they continue to hamper attempts to improve productivity. The book reviews a range of management theories, including Six Sigma, downsizing, and management by objective. After showing where the holes lie, it offers alternative approaches that have proven effective in a growing number of private and public sector organizations, including some that enable a more positive workplace culture. Illustrating practical application with case studies, the book provides simple suggestions for change that can be highly beneficial to your organization. It addresses the major myths that managers need to examine and eventually do away with or, at least, replace with modified versions that make more sense in today’s increasingly competitive business environment.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management"]},{"id":"9781789666465","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Trusted Executive, 2nd Edition","authors":["John Blakey"],"pages":"224","publication_date":"October 2020","description":"Understand why trust-building is key to a leader's ability to transform an organization and learn how build a positive relationship with your workforce and stakeholders.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9780814415580","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Going Lean Fieldbook","authors":["Stephen A.

R&D teams that have smooth handoffs deliver 100 percent of the required knowledge at those handoffs. As a result, such teams do not lose critical information, have unexpected knowledge gaps appear in their projects, or have uncoordinated knowledge transfers that waste minutes, days, and even months every year.\n\nCreating a Lean R&D System: Lean Principles and Approaches for Pharmaceutical and Research-Based Organizations lays out the logic of why Lean implementation isn’t strictly for manufacturing and describes why it can be just as effective in R&D organizations. Terence Barnhart, former senior director of continuous improvement at Pfizer R&D, describes the theoretical and physical underpinnings of creating a Lean transformation in any R&D organization, as exemplified by the Lean transformation initiated within the R&D division of a global pharmaceutical company.\n\nDescribing how to merge Lean principles with the cultural virtues inherent in R&D, the book presents Lean approaches that can be easily applied in pharmaceutical and research-based organizations. It takes a strategic approach to solving two problems unique to the Lean field. The first is in noting the key distinctions between R&D and manufacturing, and developing a Lean approach specific to the R&D environment. The second is that it proposes a systematic middle-out (merger/maneuver) strategy to help you initiate and sustain a Lean culture within your pharmaceutical R&D organization that will help you immediately engage all stakeholders involved.","tags":["Business","Project & Product Management","Product Management","Lean"]},{"id":"9780071463324","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The New Manager's Handbook","authors":["Morey Stettner"],"pages":"128","publication_date":"March 2006","description":"From employees to bosses, a manager's job is filled with challenges that have to be met quickly and effectively.

That’s the essence of Leadership U: it starts with ‘U’ but it’s not about ‘U.’\n\nThose timeless words are timelier than ever today, as leaders look to accelerate through the crisis curve. As author Gary Burnison observes, “There will likely be more change in the next two years than we have seen in the last twenty.”\n\nNow, in Leadership U: Accelerating Through the Crisis Curve, Burnison lays out a framework—his “Six Degrees of Leadership”—to show leaders how to create change. \n\nAnticipate – foreseeing what lies ahead, amid ambiguity and uncertainty that are throttled up like never before\n\nNavigate – course-correcting in real time, to keep the organization on an even keel\n\nCommunication – constantly connecting with others; the leader is both the messenger and the message\n\nListen – breaking down the organizational hierarchy to gather insights at all levels—especially what the leader doesn’t want to hear\n\nLearn – applying learning agility, to “know what to do when you don’t know what to do”\n\nLead – empowering others in a bottom-up culture that is more nimble, agile, innovative, and entrepreneurial than ever before.\n\nOnly by embracing these truths can leaders master another ‘U’—the “crisis curve” that will completely disrupt the business landscape.  The world has changed—forever. The old days are fine to reminiscence about, but you can’t stay there.\n\nToday leadership means becoming comfortable with being uncomfortable. As Burnison says, when a door closes, leaders cannot afford to stand there, staring at it. It’s a “get up or give up” moment. For leaders, the only choice is to find and open another door. Leadership U defines and inspires the pathway through that door.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781607281061","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Performance Basics, 2nd Edition","authors":["Joe Willmore"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"May 2016","description":"Understanding performance improvement is imperative.Have you noticed the trend toward performance in your profession?

Edited by Todd Pittinsky of Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, this collection of essays brings together two powerful scholarly disciplines: intergroup relations and leadership. What emerges is a new mandate for leaders to reassess what have been regarded as some very successful tactics for building group cohesion. Leaders can no longer just \"rally the troops.\" Instead they must employ more positive means to span boundaries, affirm identity, cultivate trust, and collaborate productively.In this multidisciplinary volume, highly regarded business scholars, social psychologists, policy experts, and interfaith activists provide not only theoretical frameworks around these ideas, but practical tools and specific case studies as well. Examples from around the world and from every sector - corporate, political, and social - bring to life the art and practice of intergroup leadership in the twenty-first century.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781422163351","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Leadership Can Be Taught","authors":["Sharon Daloz Parks"],"pages":"304","publication_date":"September 2005","description":"If leaders are made, not born, what is the best way to teach the skills they need to be effective? Today's complex times require a new kind of leadership--one that encompasses a mind-set and capabilities that can't necessarily be taught by conventional methods. In this unique leadership book, Sharon Daloz Parks invites readers to step into the classroom of Harvard leadership virtuoso Ronald Heifetz and his colleagues to understand this dynamic type of leadership and experience a corresponding mode of learning called \"case in point.\" Unlike traditional teaching approaches that analyze the experiences of past leaders, case in point uses individuals' own experiences--and the classroom environment itself--as a crucible for learning. This bold approach enables emerging leaders to work actively through the complex demands of today's workplace and build their skills as they discover theory in practice. Through an engaging, you-are-there writing style, Parks outlines essential features of this approach that can be applied across a range of settings. In the process, Leadership Can Be Taught reveals how we can learn, practice, and teach the art of leadership in more skilled, effective, and inspired forms.

The relations of power and visibility enrich these discussions. Regarding information and communication sciences, three main uses of this concept are presented, on the one hand to illustrate the heuristic scope of issues integrating the dispositive and, on the other hand, to demonstrate its unifying aspect in this disciplinary field. The first use concerns the complexity of media content production; the second relates to activity traces using the concept of the “secondary information dispositive”; finally, the third involves the use of the dispositive in contexts of digital participation.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Strategic Thinking"]},{"id":"9781000650549","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Our House, 2nd Edition","authors":["Antony Williams"],"pages":"164","publication_date":"September 2019","description":"Gives consultants and facilitators vivid yet sturdy ways to help their clients.

The transformational coach can awaken individuals and groups to greater awareness and a sense of purpose that enables them to move through these barriers and access untapped sources of energy for breakthrough potential.\n\nThis book offers a practical yet provocative approach and gives coaches, organizational and business leaders, HR executives, and other change agents a proven approach for creating transformative change on an individual and collective scale by first coaching themselves and then other individuals, their teams, and their organizations for significant improvements in performance and effectiveness.\n\nThis is a hopeful book that envisions individuals bringing their whole selves to work; work as an act of co-creation among everyone in the organization; and organizations deepening their connection to their employees, stakeholders and partners, and society as a whole. The book's unique contributions to the field of individual and collective transformation in the workplace are built on three central ideas: Radical improvement is possible only through a transformation rooted in expanding consciousness and integrating the body, mind, and spirit. Purpose and vision can then be drawn from deeper wisdom and fueled from a larger source of creative energy, spirit-generated creativity.\n\nRadical improvement in collective performance is not a top-down phenomenon. Rather it hinges upon the individual members embracing transformation in their own lives and finding alignment between their and the group's purpose, vision, and values Radical improvement can be implemented, sustained, and repeated if it is pursued through a holistic, systematic, yet practical framework that also incorporates solid processes for planning and implementing change and measuring results.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Executive Coaching"]},{"id":"9781605098838","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Collective Visioning","authors":["Linda Stout"],"pages":"240","publication_date":"May 2011","description":"It's an unfortunate fact of social organizing that, despite even the best intentions, groups convened to effect positive change often fail to empower people from all backgrounds to speak up or to tap into a positive and inspiring collective vision. Longtime social justice crusader Linda Stout details a practical process that enables everyone—even those commonly marginalized—to work together with honesty, passion, commitment, and joy to create a positive, energizing, and sustainable vision and to make that vision a reality. Stout shows, in practical terms, how to bring a group together, build trust, ensure that each and every voice is heard, create a positive vision, and develop an action plan that leverages everyone's abilities to bring that vision to fruition. Used successfully by more than 120 organizations—and illustrated here by dozens of practical examples and exercises—this process creates hope for change, even among those who've stopped believing that change is possible.

Wayne Rogers—star of the classic TV series M*A*S*H*—has had even more success as a businessman and entrepreneur than as an actor. Applying his own unique viewpoint to a wide range of businesses (a restaurant, a vineyard, a chain of convenience stores, the world of banking, real estate, a film distribution company, and even a famous bridal boutique), the iconoclastic star has steadfastly refused to accept limitations, and boldly forged a path for himself beyond the stifling constraints of the corporate system. Filled with insights and engaging stories, Make Your Own Rules paints a fascinating portrait of how Rogers excelled precisely because he didn’t have prior experience in each of these businesses…or any preconceived notions of how they should be run. Rogers reveals the keys to his success over the past four decades—lessons that are even more important today. After all, in the current economic climate, learning to be creative, challenge convention, and seize unexpected opportunities is not only liberating—it can make all the difference to success. Anyone who yearns to succeed without the burdens of corporate culture can thrive outside the establishment. Whether you are an entrepreneur, a small business owner, changing careers, or just entering the workforce, Make Your Own Rules delivers the inspiration and guidance you need to climb the ladder of your choice.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Executive Coaching"]},{"id":"9780749447649","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"The New Boss","authors":["Peter Fischer"],"pages":"192","publication_date":"August 2008","description":"The New Boss is a practical guide to advise newly appointed managers how to survive the first one hundred days in their new role.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781604913996","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Leadership in Action: Issues and Observations - Two Ways About it - Learning to Deal with Ambiguity","authors":["Don W.

Written by a team of trail-blazing leaders, this book reveals the secrets of companies that discovered the power of culture and space. This insightful guide reveals what companies lose by viewing office space as something to manage or minimize. With practical tips and implementation details, the book helps the reader see that the workspace is, in fact, a crucial driver of productivity and morale.\n\nChange Your Space, Change Your Culture was born out of recent studies that expose truly outrageous \"Oh, my God\" realities:\n\nMore than 70 percent of the workforce either hates their job or they are just going through the motions.\n\nHalf of all office space is wasted.\n\nThose shattering facts exist because office space is generally regarded as \"overhead\" or \"sunk cost.\" Most buildings today clearly communicate the low priority placed on people-friendly design. Poor workforce engagement is baked into the culture. This book provides guidance on turning this around, by rethinking and reshaping space to align with the way people work.

The book discusses techniques for senior executives based on history and neuroscience to enhance their \"managerial leadership\" in different environments. The ethical dilemmas of directors and executives are explored, with lessons from both leadership failures and successes.\n\nThe Principles and Practice of Effective Leadership redefines \"leadership\" as a morally neutral activity, reflecting the impact of strategic, cultural and operational contexts on a leader’s effectiveness. The authors suggest there are universal but morally neutral techniques for effective leadership that depend on the context in which they are practiced. In Part 1, the careers and personalities of historical figures including Elizabeth Tudor, Napoleon, and Atatürk are examined. Part 2 deliberates on why leadership cannot be separated from effective management and concludes that leadership is managerial, and best encapsulated in the concept of \"wayfinding.\" In Part 3, the authors discuss the techniques \"wayfinders\" can learn to be both effective and ethical, using a simple and practical framework.\n\nThis insightful book is essential reading for professionals, coaches, consultants, and academics interested in techniques and ethics of leadership and executive education.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781562865412","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"10 Steps to Successful Training","authors":["Elaine Biech"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"March 2009","description":"Designed for the trainer in all of us, 10 Steps to Successful Training takes a unique approach to becoming a winning instructor.

The men and women who work there sustain performance at seemingly otherworldly levels of precision, accuracy, and consistency. In the fifth and final book of Mark Miller's High Performance series, he uses his trademark business fable format to show how any organization can cultivate the kind of everyday habits that yield extraordinary results. Miller tells the story of Blake Brown, a CEO who learns how to help his team to consistently excel at execution from a perhaps unlikely source: his son's high school football coach. The story is fictional, but the principles and practices are very real, derived from years of research led by a team from Stanford University. Miller and his team interviewed leaders and employees from numerous world-class organizations, including the Navy SEALS, Starbucks, Apple, Southwest Airlines, the Seattle Seahawks, Mayo Clinic, Cirque du Soleil, and more. The lessons learned were then field-tested with over seventy businesses employing over 7,000 people. Miller gives you proven tools to release the untapped potential in your people, create a strong competitive advantage, and win not just on game day but every day.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management"]},{"id":"9781292095677","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Business Express: Communicate Like a Leader","authors":["Gill Hasson"],"pages":"1","publication_date":"July 2015","description":"If you need to be in the know in no time at all, Business Express will get you from beginner to brilliant in the blink of an eye. This fast, focused and carefully crafted eBook will help you pick up all the essential knowledge you need about the skills that matter most at work, all in the shortest possible time. Learn just when you need to or well in advance; read it at your desk or on the move; dip in and out or start from scratch - it’s all up to you.

Like it or not, the realities uncovered in this book are just that...real! And if you plan to be a significant player in the workplace of the future, I suggest you take them seriously, because your success depends on it. As John says, ‘As goes the world, so goes the workplace.’” —Richard Irwin, President and CEO, IntegraCare Corporation\n\n“John captures a refreshing, winning formula in a practical, simple context to leverage weirdness into creativity and innovation, the core of sustainable competitive advantage and success. Rejoice in and celebrate our weirdos!” —James E. Hoffman, Jr., President, Catalyst Consultants, LLC, and the CEO Forum of Pittsburgh\n\n“To hear John Putzier tell it, there are so many ‘weirdos in the workplace’ that you’re almost weird if you’re...not. But if you’re a manager, don’t let how weird someone is distract you from what really matters—how well they’re performing. Here’s help for jumping to the right conclusions about people.” —Maureen Anderson, Host, “The Career Clinic®” radio program\n\n“This book gives a dose of medicine to cure the ‘paradigm bug’ that plagues most of us in the business world. The author takes complex situations and concepts and boils them down to their bare essence. I just wish I could have him by my side when they happen to me! I guess having this book is the next best thing.” —Mark A. Treat, Client Services Organization Development, Acxiom Corporation, CMTII Group\n\n“Putzier has nailed the American paradox: the tension between individuality and the need for organized group effort. His decision-making and problem-solving tools help to resolve this classic cultural conflict: the value of ‘weird’ thinking, diversity, and individuality pushing the bounds of what is normal, versus the utility of social norms in groups. His book is a primer for designing organizations, departments, or teams to maximize off-center behavior. This balance, already a rare one, will increase in importance as work becomes delocalized, cross-disciplinary, and global. This book provides basic knowledge for any company committed to innovation or excellence—or just competitive advantage.” —Margaret J. King, Ph.D., Director, The Center for Cultural Studies & Analysis, American Creativity Association\n\nSurviving and Thriving in the Age of the Individual\n\nOne employee always wears the same outfit to work, another talks to herself all day, another moonlights as a stripper, another has fierce body odor, and still another adorns his cubicle with hateful messages about his boss. As a manager, what should you do about such behavior? The best answers aren’t obvious! Your most innovative and productive people are often your strangest, and while weirdness can be rooted in brilliance, it can also be a real annoyance that serves no purpose.\n\nLike it or not, as modern culture embraces the individual, weirdos—anyone different from you!—become more commonplace. In Weirdos in the Workplace, top human resources consultant John Putzier explains how managers can harness the natural weirdness often found in high performers at every level, while curbing behavior that’s disruptive. Putzier presents 32 fascinating, real-world case studies to illustrate the legal, human resources, and business ramifications of unusual behavior in the workplace, and which solutions are most effective.\n\nThis book explains how to\n\nManage unconventional people by understanding why they behave as they do, and what to do about it\n\nMigrate toward a high-performing organization built around the individual, and foster an environment that attracts, motivates, and retains the best and brightest\n\nTap your own natural weirdness and find your niche by integrating your abilities, interests, and the market\n\nWeirdos in the Workplace is for every manager, human resources professional, or coworker who deals with unorthodox employees and their behaviors.

They're writing about how to manage workers, but none of these experts really understands the viewpoint of the average worker, the regular grunt in the trenches-the peon. Peons are the ones affected when a manager decides to manage-in-one-minute, to move somebody's cheese, to try that fifth discipline. Rather than consult some expert, why not go to the source, and ask the peons? Who better to teach you how to train a dog than the dog himself? And who better to tell you how to manage than one of those who are being managed? The Peon Book gives managers the perspective they've been lacking. Author and self-proclaimed Chief Executive Peon Dave Haynes' sole, powerful source of expertise is that he has been managed in different companies and in different industries, and he knows what worked-and what failed catastrophically. In irreverent, straight-talking terms, Haynes tells managers what they really need to do to make their employees motivated, committed, and productive-and it's not memorizing yet another \"technique\" or \"strategy\" or \"discipline.\" Haynes writes in a common sense, easy-to-read style that is both witty and wise. Every boss can benefit, and every employee can empathize with the words in The Peon Book. \"The inability to empathize can be a real speed bump on the road to a trusting, personal relationship with your employees. So how are you supposed to show more empathy? I take issue with management books that give you a phrase to say to show empathy like 'I understand,' or 'I know what you mean,' or that say that by rephrasing a statement you can show empathy. Don't use some coined phrase to show empathy, just mentally put yourself in our shoes. Sometimes it's just a matter of remembering what it's like to have to get all those reports turned in on a Friday. Or remembering what it's like to have to ask for time off. Or remembering what it's like to be the new guy on the job, and have a hard time remembering everything. Do you see the key concept I'm getting at? Empathy = remembering.

Agile transformations are supposed to make organizations modern, competitive, and relevant. But in the well-intentioned effort to move into the future, change leaders find themselves frustrated by pushback, limited impact, poor practices, and unfair criticism. What's going on? Jesse Fewell's book cuts through the “quick-fix” hype of agile theory and explains a recurring transformational pattern that unpacks what holds organizations back. The boost is the initial gains from logical first steps; the barrier is the unavoidable roadblock that must come next; and the rebound is the way forward to further gains by leaning against the concept of the original boost. With these counterintuitive rebounds, Fewell identifies seven leadership moves that can be used to unblock stalled agile transformations. No, your transformation is not a failure. It turns out the buy-in, the talent, the alignment, and the growth you need to break through are already in front of you; it's all simply hidden under the surface—undiscovered, unutilized, and untapped.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781609940089","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"True North Groups","authors":["Bill George","Douglas M.

We need a small group of people with whom we can have in-depth discussions and share intimately about the most important things in our lives—our happiness and sadness, our hopes and fears, our beliefs and convictions. For the past thirty-five years, Bill George and Doug Baker have found the answer in what they call True North Groups.“At various times,” George and Baker write, “a True North Group will function as a nurturer, a grounding rod, a truth teller, and a mirror. At other times the group functions as a challenger or an inspirer. When people are wracked with self-doubts, it helps build their courage and ability to cope.”Drawing on recent research in psychology and sociology, George and Baker explain why True North Groups are so critical to helping us develop the self-awareness, compassion, emotional intelligence, and authenticity required to be inspired human beings and inspiring leaders. They cover every detail from choosing members, establishing norms, and dealing with conflicts to evaluating progress and deciding when it's time to restructure. True North Groups provides a wealth of practical resources, including suggested topics for the first twelve meetings, advice on facilitating groups, techniques to evaluate group satisfaction, and much more.

The author details his journey from industry Lean practitioner to a consultant in a top-tier consultancy firm to developing his own consulting practice.\n\nThis book will serve as a crucial resource for experienced Lean practitioners who are seeking: insight on how to gain more from their Lean efforts, how to overcome resistance to change (that is, to effectively convey 'What’s in it for me?' to their business associates), and to understand how other companies have overcome the barriers to implementing Lean and incorporated it as the commonsense approach to continuous improvement.","tags":["Business","Project & Product Management","Product Management","Lean"]},{"id":"9781633691407","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"How to Choose a Leadership Pattern","authors":["Robert Tannenbaum","Warren H.

It goes beyond merely acknowledging cultural differences. In reality, it means you are able to adapt your behavior to conform to new cultural contexts without losing your authentic self in the process. Not only is this difficult, it’s a frightening prospect for most people and something completely outside their comfort zone.But managing and communicating with people from other cultures is an essential skill today. Most of us collaborate with teams across borders and cultures on a regular basis, whether we spend our time in the office or out on the road. What’s needed now is a critical new skill, something author Andy Molinsky calls global dexterity.In this book Molinsky offers the tools needed to simultaneously adapt behavior to new cultural contexts while staying authentic and grounded in your own natural style. Based on more than a decade of research, teaching, and consulting with managers and executives around the world, this book reveals an approach to adapting while feeling comfortablean essential skill that enables you to switch behaviors and overcome the emotional and psychological challenges of doing so.From identifying and overcoming challenges to integrating what you learn into your everyday environment, Molinsky provides a guidebookand mentoringto raise your confidence and your profile.

This book reviews the literature and results of an empirical study that investigated the relationship between mechanistic and organic cultures and the level of trust in technology-based organizations.\n\nThe book outlines the literature on organizational trust and culture and the role theorists believe they play in the success of a changing domestic and global business environment. It identifies ways of defining culture and trust as well as the survey instruments used to measure them. The book then examines the results of two studies that demonstrate the connection between organizational culture and trust. The two studies were conducted at separate times using data collected from several companies within a three-hour radius of each other. These companies are highly dependent upon the ability to identify, hire, and retain highly skilled knowledge workers. These workers are critical for the companies to successfully compete within the scope of their business and expand into their current and other markets.\n\nThe book provides a practitioner’s guide—based on the literature review and the results of the studies examined—that can be used to assess, diagnose, and improve employees’ perception of their work culture and improve trust found in organizations.

Journal articles, blogs and books try to home in on the essence of an effective leader. While there is common agreement that a executive's performance can make or break company, defining that essence of effective leadership remains the Holy Grail for those who find themselves at the top, for those who are responsible for carrying out the strategies and dictates of their managers, and for the shareholders who want to see commitment, action and positive financial return.\n\nBreaking the Leadership Mold is designed to help senior executives and managers respond to the challenges of today and shed the vestiges of days gone by. In so doing they will better lead and enable their staff, and create a work environment that is healthy, engaging, productive and sustainable. Based on the author's extensive research and 35 years' experience in working with local, national and international companies, Breaking the Leadership Mold offers 20 principles-such as Principle #10: Recognize How Executive Team Dynamics Promote Mediocrity and Principle #14: Get Other Executives On Board (or Out of the Way)—that when implemented will ensure that not only is there effective communication throughout the organization, from top to bottom and bottom to top, but also that employees and executives alike contribute to their full potential. The net result — the organization wins on every measure. The 20 principles are built on the pillars of case studies, experience and research.\n\nEffective leadership is an absolute in any business environment, but becomes even more critical in times when businesses face unprecedented challenges and need to be nimble and responsive to change. Breaking the Mold has proven strategies to empower, unite and galvanize managers and employees — and their organization - to enable them to prosper and adapt in a swift-changing environment.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781604913231","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Leadership in Action: In Focus - Leadership Styles - If It's Lagom, This Must be Sweden","authors":["Kristina Williams","Kay Devine"],"pages":"2","publication_date":"August 2005","description":"Paradoxically, despite their unemotional countenance, Swedish executives are likely to exhibit a people-oriented leadership style.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"53863MIT62306","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"How Leaders Can Optimize Teams’ Emotional Landscapes","authors":["Jeffrey Sanchez-Burks","Christina Bradley","Lindred Greer"],"pages":"7","publication_date":"January 2021","description":"Within a workplace, emotional landscapes — the collective composition of employee sentiments — directly influence how people make sense of situations.

Management education, which prepares human capital for industry, is expected to address these challenges along with others such as intensifying competition, advancing technology, increasing workforce diversity and accelerating complexity. Yet, current management education is largely based on traditional capitalism where the focus tends toward profits and competitiveness rather than toward a balance among profitability, responsibility, social accountability and sustainability. Consequently, management education in general, and MBA education in particular, need to adopt a paradigm shift in order to be more responsible and sustainable. The book contains contributions on the core management topics covered in general management, organizational behavior, ethics and social responsibility, with a focus on responsible management. Its chapters come from many authors in PRME schools from eight countries. Hence, it is expected to be useful to all the B-schools, across geographies that are interested in embedding responsibility in their management curriculum and teaching methodology.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781422155158","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Managing in a Time of Great Change","authors":["Peter Ferdinand Drucker"],"pages":"352","publication_date":"November 2009","description":"For more than half a century, Peter F.

The authors provide a disciplined approach to framing your legacy, as well as shaping it over time.

They then demonstrate how to assess your current impact on those around you, strengthen that impact, and pass along the best of yourself in the process.

The U.S. market comprises about 600 publicly and privately held companies, valued at about $22 billion per year at wholesale for traditional toys, which has remained relatively constant since the 1990s. It is also the only industry where success depends on the whims of a child.

How to create new sources of competitive advantage to sustain long-term growth, and 2. How to engage leaders at every level of the organization so that they are more proactive and forward-looking in their area of responsibility. The Art of Strategic Leadership uses a unique approach to examine what it means to be a strategic leader. Instead of focusing on the skills, behaviors, and tools found in typical books on strategic leadership, the authors shed light on the attributes and qualities necessary to lead strategic change and help transform a business. Strategic leadership is what modern leadership is all about. Organizations expect leaders to anticipate and be proactive more than ever before. In this book, the authors draw on their vast experience working directly with leaders at all levels and use an intriguing narrative to explain this inside-out approach to understanding strategic leadership. The narrative follows the journey of how one manager discovered these critically important qualities. You will experience first-hand how these values and attributes manifest in the lives of realistic leaders; how they orchestrate long-term strategic change needed for the organization to compete and survive and actively shape the future while delivering short-term results.\n\nThe Art of Strategic Leadership provides the content that will help you informally assess and reflect on your own strategic leadership qualities—those that are strengths and those that indicate areas you need to develop. It will guide you as you incorporate these values and qualities into your own leadership style and become a more effective catalyst for change. This book will help you in the following ways:\n\nDevelop a more proactive, forward-thinking approach to leadership\nApproach strategy from both short- and long-term perspectives\nAdopt the core values and principles of a strategic leader\nModel the qualities exhibited by powerful leaders\n\nStrategic leaders serve as powerful examples to others in the organization. Their qualities and traits spread rapidly to those around them, empowering people at every level to take a more active role in meeting the demands of the future. The Art of Strategic Leadership will help you deepen and broaden your understanding of the core qualities of strategic leadership, leaving you better equipped to lead yourself and your team to a better place and create greater value for customers, owners, and employees.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781626568679","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Cultural Intelligence, 3rd Edition","authors":["David C.

By measuring success in multiple dimensions using multivariate methods you will be able to determine what works and what doesn't. The key is to measure and promote progress in terms of organizational vision, mission, and overarching goals.\n\nBusiness leaders too often succumb to the working assumption that they only have to show shareholders and boards of trustees that they are turning a profit—the higher the profit, the more successful their stewardship of the company. Wrong! To truly thrive and endure, all organizations—corporate, government, small, large, nonprofit, or startup—need to define and pursue the underlying purpose for their existence.\n\nTo measure success, leaders today are missing a key meta-analytic in their toolbox. In this book, metrics consultant Martin Klubeck provides it to them. Success Metrics steps you through the process of identifying and combining the right measures to gauge, narrate, and guide your organization's progress toward true success. All organizations have a common goal to be successful. All leaders want to make data-informed decisions and use measures to improve processes, communicate progress, and gain support. The problem is that proxy or partial measures don't measure overall success and can be misleading. They measure performance parameters, progress on a specific task, customer feedback, and other piecemeal indices—which taken separately fail to describe an organization's progress toward overall success.\n\nThe author's integrated measures of success can be used to communicate organizational progress to stakeholders, shareholders, boards of trustees, corporate leaders, the workforce, and the customer base and thereby galvanize broad commitment to organizational success. Klubeck shows how his principles and methods of measuring overall success can be applied at all levels: individual, team, group, department, division, and organization.\n\nWhat You Will Learn:\n\nUnderstand why you should measure success instead of performance\n\nUnderstand what to measure and what not to measure\n\nIntegrate the measures of success to tell a complete story\n\nShare measures of success with different audiences\n\nWho This Book Is For\n\nOrganizational leaders at all levels from the executive suite to middle management, analysts and consultants who are tasked with designing metrics programs for organizations, individuals interested in adapting the author's framework to measure overall personal success in multiple dimensions","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"53863MIT59448","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Getting Dispersed Teams Right","authors":["MIT Sloan Management Review"],"pages":"107","publication_date":"July 2018","description":"What are the best ways for companies to manage and take advantage of virtual teams?

Yet groups are not a panacea for organizational problems; conflicts between individuals or factions within a group often create seemingly contradictory situations paradoxes that can prevent the group from reaching its goals.\n\nIn this groundbreaking classic, Kenwyn Smith and David Berg offer a revolutionary approach to understanding groups and overcoming the problems that often paralyze group members, the group as a whole, and relations among groups. They explore the hidden dynamics that can prevent a group from functioning effectively. And they show how an apparently paradoxical suggestion for example, inviting a success oriented group to risk failure, or affirming the benefits of going nowhere to a group focused on moving ahead can break action barriers, overcome conflicts, and improve group performance.\n\nSmith and Berg offer a different way of thinking about groups that will open new avenues of inquiry for professors and students of group behavior, and they propose many innovative ideas that will prove valuable to consultants, trainers, therapists, and others who work with groups on a regular basis.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management"]},{"id":"9781118235102","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Leading Culture Change in Global Organizations: Aligning Culture and Strategy","authors":["Daniel Denison","Robert Hooijberg","Nancy Lane"],"pages":"240","publication_date":"June 2012","description":"Filled with case studies from firms such as GT Automotive, GE Healthcare China, Vale, Dominos, Swiss Re Americas Division, and Polar Bank, among others, this book (written by Dan Denison and his co-authors) combines twenty years of research and survey results to illustrate a critical set of cultural dynamics that firms need to manage in order to remain competitive.

Data collected from thousands of the world's best leaders—and their subordinates—reveals the keys to success: authenticity, coaching, insight, and innovation. By incorporating these methods into their everyday workflow, these leaders have propelled their teams to heights great enough to highlight the divide between successful and not-so-successful leadership. This book shows you how to put these key factors to work in your own practice, with clear examples and concrete steps for improving skills and competencies. New data from the author's own research into executive functioning describes the neurological aspects of leadership, and a deep look at the leaders of tomorrow delves into the fundamental differences that set them apart—and fuel their achievement.\n\nLeadership is changing, both in look and practice; strictly authoritative approaches are quickly losing ground as today's workers discover the power of collaboration and the importance of interpersonal awareness.

Rather than devote time to expensive, long, and often unsuccessful transformations, leaders should instead focus on holistically designing and honing the management systems that are the nervous systems of their businesses. They can take a cue from chefs and other artisans and hone their organizations. After all, honing doesn't sharpen knives; it realigns a knife's steel to its original position. Choosing and honing the set of management systems that promote an organization's desired outcomes (and uninstalling them when they are past their prime) is one of the most important things a business leader can do—and is just as much art as science.\n\nThe third in a trilogy of business strategy books written by renowned strategists and two-time Thinkers50–nominated authors Steven Goldbach and Geoff Tuff, this book explains why and how to optimally hone your organization's execution of its strategy, with highlights including:\n\nThe importance of recognizing and taking action to defy the drift that often afflicts organizations undergoing massive transformation\nGuidelines on how to design and continually reshape effective management systems to influence organizational and individual behaviors\nReframing the job of CEOs to be Chief System Designers for their organizations\nReflections on how honing principles within organizations can be used on broader societal challenges such as addressing climate change via the energy transition\n\nEngaging, pragmatic, and inspiring, Hone: How Purposeful Leaders Defy Drift earns a well-deserved spot on the bookshelves of all private, public, and nonprofit sector professionals seeking to bring new sources of advantage to their organizations in a time of accelerating uncertainty and exponential change.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"53863MIT61426","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Five Ways Leaders Can Support Remote Work","authors":["Donald Sull","Charles Sull","Josh Bersin"],"pages":"12","publication_date":"June 2020","description":"A shift to widespread remote work during the COVID-19 pandemic has created new challenges, but the good news is that organizations around the world are experimenting with creative solutions to meet workers’ needs.

This book champions Radical Product Thinking, a systematic methodology for building visionary, game-changing products.Methodologies such as Lean and Agile have democratized innovation by teaching us to harness the power of iteration to innovate faster, but our ability to set a clear destination hasn't kept up with the pace. When we iterate without a clear vision or strategy, our products become bloated, fragmented, and driven by irrelevant metrics. They catch “product diseases” that are often fatal to true innovation. In Radical Product Thinking (RPT), product development is led by the vision for the change it's intended to create. This methodology helps leaders reimagine the problems they face and align their team to find creative solutions using five elements: Vision, Strategy, Prioritization, Execution, and Culture. R. Dutt guides readers through these elements so they develop a clear process for achieving their desired change, incorporate it into daily activities, and turn RPT skills into muscle memory. This book gives organizations a repeatable model for building vision-driven products by helping us systematically translate vision and strategy into everyday actions so our product becomes a vehicle for creating the change we want to see in the world.

It is a place full of dysfunctional bright people who are in an incredible hurry to find the next big thing so they can strike it rich and then do it all over again. Among these people are managers, a strange breed of people who, through a mystical organizational ritual, have been given power over the future and bank accounts of many others. Whether you're an aspiring manager, a current manager, or just wondering what the heck a manager does all day, there is a story in this book that will speak to you—and help you survive and prosper amongst the general craziness.\n\nLopp's straight-from-the-hip style is unlike any other writer on management.

Never have there been so many opportunities to inspire and influence in everyday situations -- elevator chats, corridor conversations, networking gatherings, meetings, and ceremonial events. Indeed, today the most iconic leadership moments are spontaneous, spur-of-the-moment events that reveal the inner workings of the leader's mind. When these impromptu opportunities arise, leaders must be able to listen, think, and respond within seconds. They don't read a script from a page, they convey the narrative that is already in their mind. They can tailor a message—in a meeting, in the corridor, or in a tweet—to influence and inspire any audience. Those who shine in that moment are remembered for their leadership. Those who stumble are remembered for their gaffes, mixed messages, or insensitivity. Nobody remembers the leaders who retreat to their office, formulate a strategic plan, and distribute a memo the following week.\n\nGuided by her entrepreneurial success as founder of The Humphrey Group and her firm's work with tens of thousands of leaders over the past 30 years, Judith Humphrey makes clear the importance of preparing to be spontaneous -- as counterintuitive as that may sound! Drawing upon the best impromptu moments from the Greeks to the present, the book looks at every aspect of impromptu speaking. You will learn how to:\n\nThink like an impromptu leader\nQuickly read an audience of one or a thousand\nCollect your thoughts and craft a persuasive message\n'Script' yourself within seconds for any occasion\nAvoid 'um's' and 'ah's' and use the right words at the right time\nDiscover improv techniques that will enable you to shine\nDeliver your message with clarity, confidence, and conviction.\n\nThe ability to speak on the spot is often seen as an innate gift, a talent of 'natural-born' leaders. The truth is, it's a skill that can be learned—a skill that is quickly becoming a must-have for anyone in a leadership position. Impromptu provides clear, actionable guidance to help you reach your full leadership potential.

You can be—but first, you’ve got to understand what sets great leaders apart from all the rest.Certainly, leaders need people skills, execution skills, a deep knowledge of industry trends, the ability to articulate a vision, and more—they must be competent—but that’s just the tip of the iceberg. What’s below the waterline? What’s deep inside the best leaders that makes them different?Mark Miller contends it is their leadership character. In his latest enlightening and entertaining business fable, he describes the five unique character traits exhibited by exceptional leaders and how to cultivate them.The Heart of Leadership begins with young and ambitious Blake Brown being passed over for a desperately wanted promotion, despite an outstanding individual performance. Confused and frustrated, he turns to his former mentor, Debbie Brewster. Rather than attempting to solve Blake’s problem for him, she sends him on a quest to meet with five of his late father’s colleagues, each of whom holds a piece of the puzzle he’s trying to solve.As Blake puts the pieces together, he discovers that in the final analysis, a lack of skills isn’t what holds most leaders back; skills are too easy to learn. Without demonstrated leadership character, however, a skill set will never be enough. Most often, when leaders fail to reach their full potential, it is an issue of the heart. This is Blake’s ultimate revelation.This book shows us that leadership needn’t be the purview of the few—it is within reach for millions around the world.

Mentors and mentees may come from very different backgrounds and have limited understanding of each other's cultures and outlooks. But mentoring remains the most powerful tool for creating meaningful relationships, furthering professional development, and increasing engagement and retention. Younger workers and emerging leaders in particular are demanding it. Lisa Z. Fain and Lois J. Zachary offer a timely, evidence-based, practical guide for helping mentors develop the level of cultural competency needed to bridge differences. Firmly rooted in Zachary's well-known four-part mentoring model, the book uses three fictional scenarios featuring three pairs of diverse mentors and mentees to illustrate how key concepts can play out in real life. It offers an array of accessible tools and strategies designed to help you increase your self-awareness and prepare you to embrace and leverage differences in your mentoring relationships. But beyond tips and techniques, Fain and Zachary emphasize that authenticity is the key—the ultimate purpose of this book is to help the mentor and mentee make a genuine connection and learn from each other.

In principle, at least, business has heeded that call. Acknowledging the need for employee leadership and shared responsibility, companies worldwide have invested heavily in every variety of employee-empowerment program. Yet, such reform efforts seldom have any lasting effect, and managers and subordinates quickly slip back into old follow-the-leader patterns of thinking and behaving.\n\nDoes this mean that the skeptics were right all along? Are participative management, self-directed work teams, and other popular empowerment programs just part of a futile effort to change \"human nature\"? Not at all, say David L. Bradford and Allan R. Cohen in this practical follow-up to their international bestsellers Managing for Excellence and Influence Without Authority. They show conclusively that to believe this grossly underestimates human capabilities and sacrifices any chance for success in today's fiercely competitive global marketplace.\n\nDrawing upon close observation of successful leaders and followers, Bradford and Cohen reconceptualize shared leadership to show how it requires tough and decisive behavior from managers and those who report to them. The authors provide a blueprint for making it work personally and in your organization, whatever your position or formal power.\n\nExercising their critically acclaimed talent for translating complex concepts into actionable advice and guidance, they show how to create a dynamic, supercharged organizational culture of shared responsibility. Using many real-life examples and vignettes, the authors reveal the mind-traps that keep organizations locked into outmoded concepts of leadership. A pathbreaking contribution to the new leadership from two pioneers in the field, Power Up arms managers with the concepts and tools to release the potential of employees for greater heights of productivity and performance.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781119106203","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"The Consultant's Handbook: A Practical Guide to Delivering High-value and Differentiated Services in a Competitive Marketplace","authors":["Samir Parikh"],"pages":"232","publication_date":"July 2015","description":"Delivers the essential practical skills needed to consult and make sharp, well prepared interactions in a wide range of business situations\n\nThis comprehensive handbook covers the fundamental skills and attitudes required by successful consultants from novice to practitioner level, irrespective of their specialist area.

Teamwork Is an Individual Skill shows readers how to develop the skills to thrive on any team, under any circumstances. No longer will readers find themselves complaining, \"I got assigned to a bad team.\" Instead, they'll know what to do to make any team work for them.Drawing on over twenty years of experience successfully developing professional teams in product development, R&D, and high-tech environments, Christopher Avery and his coauthors use brief thought-provoking essays, personal and teambuilding exercises, case studies, and insights from business leaders to teach readers how to build responsible and productive relationships at work. The authors show how and why your ability to assume personal responsibility-for your own work on a team and for the team's collective work-is the most important factor in ensuring a productive team experience.Teambuilding, the authors point out, is essentially a series of conversations between people who share responsibility to get something done. Teamwork Is an Individual Skill describes the way these conversations typically progress, and shows the reader how to predict and direct these conversations so that they can maximize the benefits to both themselves and to their team.Designed for easy access and for use by both individuals and groups, Teamwork Is an Individual Skill will equip readers with the mental skills and behaviors that will help them achieve personal goals while contributing to their team's success.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Team Management"]},{"id":"9781633691070","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"The Wisdom of Teams","authors":["Jon R.

Drawing on the latest findings from neuroscience, Dr. Cloud shows why it's critical for leaders to set the conditions that make people's brains perform at their highest levels. How do great leaders do this? One way is through the creation of \"boundaries\"—structures that determine what will exist and what will not.\n\nHere you will learn seven leadership boundaries that set the stage, tone, and culture for a results-driven organization, including how to\n\nhelp people focus their attention on the things that matter most;\nbuild the emotional climate that drives brain functioning;\nfacilitate connections that boost energy and momentum;\ncreate organizational thought patterns that limit negativity and helplessness;\nidentify paths for people to take control of the activities that drive results;\ncreate high-performance teams organized around the behaviors that drive results; and\nlead yourself in a manner that protects the vision.\n\nThe strong call to action in this book is that leaders are ridiculously in charge of all these elements, and they must own what they either create or allow to exist.\n\nFilled with inspiring and practical examples from Dr. Cloud's coaching practice, Boundaries for Leaders is essential reading for everyone who aspires to lead companies, teams, and cultures defined by high performance and healthy relationships.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781633691896","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Sense and Respond","authors":["Jeff Gothelf","Josh Seiden"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"February 2017","description":"The End of Assembly Line ManagementWe’re in the midst of a revolution. Quantum leaps in technology are enabling organizations to observe and measure people’s behavior in real time, communicate internally at extraordinary speed, and innovate continuously. These new, software-driven technologies are transforming the way companies interact with their customers, employees, and other stakeholders.This is no mere tech issue. The transformation requires a complete rethinking of the way we organize and manage work. And, as software becomes ever more integrated into every product and service, making this big shift is quickly becoming the key operational challenge for businesses of all kinds. We need a management model that doesn’t merely account for, but actually embraces, continuous change. Yet the truth is, most organizations continue to rely on outmoded, industrial-era operational models. They structure their teams, manage their people, and evolve their organizational cultures the way they always have.Now, organizations are emerging, and thriving, based on their capacity to sense and respond instantly to customer and employee behaviors. In Sense and Respond, Jeff Gothelf and Josh Seiden, leading tech experts and founders of the global Lean UX movement, vividly show how these companies operate, highlighting the new mindset and skills needed to lead and manage themand to continuously innovate within them.In illuminating and instructive business examples, you’ll see organizations with distinctively new operating principles: shifting from managing outputs to what the authors call outcome-focused management”; forming self-guided teams that can read and react to a fast-changing environment; creating a learning-all-the-time culture that can understand and respond to new customer behaviors and the data they generate; and finally, developing in everyone at the company the new universal skills of customer listening, assessment, and response.This engaging and practical book provides the crucial new operational and management model to help you and your organization win in a world of continuous change.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management"]},{"id":"9781633694224","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"HBR Guides to Performance Management Collection (4 Books) (HBR Guide Series)","authors":["Harvard Business Review","Mary Shapiro"],"pages":"864","publication_date":"November 2017","description":"A set of guides to help you recognize good work and encourage progress at the workplace.\n\nIf you manage a team, you need to be able to measure and manage their performance.

Drawing on stories of leaders as diverse as AG Lafley of Procter & Gamble, Meg Whitman of eBay, Victoria Hale of the Institute for One World Health, and Nandan Nilekani of Infosys, Martin shows how integrative thinkers are relentlessly diagnosing and synthesizing by asking probing questions including: What are the causal relationships at work here? and What are the implied trade-offs?\n\nMartin also presents a model for strengthening your integrative thinking skills by drawing on different kinds of knowledge including conceptual and experiential knowledge.\n\nIntegrative thinking can be learned, and The Opposable Mind helps you master this vital skill.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Strategic Thinking"]},{"id":"9781394264469","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Unlock Your Leadership Story","authors":["Pat Wadors"],"pages":"224","publication_date":"October 2024","description":"Explore the ability of stories to enhance human connection, motivate action, and uncover hidden potential\n\nIn Unlock Your Leadership Story: How to Build Understanding and Motivate Teams Using Fables and Folktales, renowned international speaker and human resources thought leader Pat Wadors delivers a powerful discussion of the lessons we can draw from some of the most well-known stories in the world.

Paterson"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"January 2015","description":"\"How can you argue with the core principles of Lean, that you focus on what provides value to your customer and eliminate work that is not necessary (muda)? Internal auditors need to understand not only who their primary customers are, but what is valuable to them - which in most cases is assurance that the risks that matter to the achievement of objectives are properly managed. We need to communicate what they need to know and not what we want to say. This incessant focus on the customer and the efficient production of a valued product should extend to every internal audit team. How else can we ensure that we optimize the use of our limited resources to address the dynamic business and risk environment within which our organizations operate?\"\n\nNorman Marks, GRC Thought Leader\n\nUsing lean techniques to enhance value add and reduce waste in internal auditing\n\nLean Auditing is a practical guide to maximising value and efficiency in internal audit through the application of lean techniques. It is an ideal book for anyone interested in understanding what progressive, value adding audit can be like. It is also ideal for anyone wondering whether audit activities can be streamlined or better co-ordinated with other activities.\n\nThe book contains practical advise from the author's experience as CAE of AstraZeneca PLC; from his work as a consultant specializing in this field; as well as insights from leading CAEs in the UK, US and elsewhere. In addition, there are important insights from thought leaders such as Richard Chambers (IIA US) and Norman Marks (GRC thought leader) and Chris Baker (Technical Manager of the IIA UK).\n\nIncreasing pressure on resources is driving a need for greater efficiency in all areas of business, and Internal Audit is no exception. Lean techniques can help streamline the workflow, but having only recently been applied to IA, lack the guidance available for other techniques. Lean Auditing fills this need by combining expert instruction and actionable advice that helps Internal Auditors:\n\nBenchmark their efficiency against lean ways of working\n\nUnderstand warning signs of waste and lower added value\n\nUnderstanding practical ways of working that improve added value and reduce waste\n\nGain confidence about progressive ways of working in internal audit\n\nUnderstand how improved ways of working in audit can positively impact the culture of the wider organization\n\nOne of the keys to the lean audit is finding out exactly what the stakeholder wants, and eliminating everything else. Scaling back certain operations can delineate audit from advisory, and in the process, dramatically improve crucial outcomes. To this end, Lean Auditing is the key to IA efficiency.","tags":["Business","Project & Product Management","Product Management","Lean"]},{"id":"9780857087911","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"LEAD: 50 models for success in work and life","authors":["John D.

Or Kenneth Lay like Lou Gerstner? Answer: They are, or were, leaders. Many would argue that tyrants, corrupt CEOs, and other abusers of power and authority are not leaders at all--at least not as the word is currently used. But, according to Barbara Kellerman, this assumption is dangerously naive. A provocative departure from conventional thinking, Bad Leadership compels us to see leadership in its entirety. Kellerman argues that the dark side of leadership--from rigidity and callousness to corruption and cruelty--is not an aberration. Rather, bad leadership is as ubiquitous as it is insidious--and so must be more carefully examined and better understood. Drawing on high-profile, contemporary examples--from Mary Meeker to David Koresh, Bill Clinton to Radovan Karadzic, Al Dunlap to Leona Helmsley--Kellerman explores seven primary types of bad leadership and dissects why and how leaders cross the line from good to bad. The book also illuminates the critical role of followers, revealing how they collaborate with, and sometimes even cause, bad leadership. Daring and counterintuitive, Bad Leadership makes clear that we need to face the dark side to become better leaders and followers ourselves. Barbara Kellerman is research director of the Center for Public Leadership and a lecturer in public policy at the Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781040098639","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Leadership Humility","authors":["Andrew J.

Will you pass the test?\n\nDespite all the effort through the years to understand what it takes to be an effective leader, the challenges of leadership remain enormously difficult and elusive; even today, most CEOs don't last five years in the job. The demands to deliver at a consistently high level can be unforgiving.\n\nThe loneliness. The weight of responsibility. The relentless second-guessing and criticism. The pressure to build all-star teams. The 24/7 schedule that requires superhuman stamina. The tough decisions that often leave no one happy. The expectation to always have the right answer when it can be hard just to know the right question.\n\nThese challenges are brought into their highest and sharpest relief in the corner office, but they are hardly unique to chief executives. All leaders face their own version of these tests, and the authors draw on the distilled wisdom, stories, and lessons from hundreds of chief executives to show how every aspiring leader can master these challenges and lead like a CEO. These foundational leadership skills will make all aspiring executives more effective in their roles today and lift the trajectory of their careers.\n\nThe CEO Test is the authoritative, no-nonsense insider's guide to navigating leadership's toughest challenges, brought to you by authors uniquely qualified to tell the stories. Adam Bryant has conducted in-depth interviews with more than 600 CEOs. Kevin Sharer spent more than two decades as president and then CEO of Amgen, where he led its expansion from $1 billion in annual revenues to nearly $16 billion. He has served on many boards and is a sought-after mentor for CEOs of global companies.\n\nLeadership is getting harder as the speed of disruption across all industries accelerates. The CEO Test will better prepare you to succeed, whether you're a CEO or just setting out to become one.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9780730354499","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Fix Your Team","authors":["Rose Bryant-Smith","Grevis Beard"],"pages":"296","publication_date":"November 2018","description":"Transform team dynamics with practical, real-world tools for sustainable change\n\nFix Your Team is the manager’s essential and practical guide to diagnosis and intervention.

By tackling problems early and providing employees with the opportunity to improve their working relationships, managers, human resources and other internal advisors demonstrate their commitment to productivity, genuine care for employees and dedication to a healthy and ethical working environment. People working in dysfunctional teams will understand better what is going on, and understand what options exist for improvement.\n\nDiagnose team problems and learn what tools are available to help\nDetermine the best use of resources and choose an implementable fix\nDevelop a business case for intervention, and get support from the top\nBuild morale, productivity and collaboration within the team\nUpskill employees to ensure sustainable improvements\nBuild accountability in everyone for a positive workplace culture\n\nIn today’s competitive environment, managers need to bring out the best in everyone.

Often left off the list are softer, more personal qualities—but they are also essential. Although a certain degree of analytical and technical skill is a minimum requirement for success, studies indicate that emotional intelligence may be the key attribute that distinguishes outstanding performers from those who are merely adequate. Psychologist and author Daniel Goleman first brought the term \"emotional intelligence\" to a wide audience with his 1995 book of the same name, and Goleman first applied the concept to business with a 1998 classic Harvard Business Review article. In his research at nearly 200 large, global companies, Goleman found that truly effective leaders are distinguished by a high degree of emotional intelligence. Without it, a person can have first-class training, an incisive mind, and an endless supply of good ideas, but he or she still won't be a great leader. The chief components of emotional intelligence—self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skill—can sound unbusinesslike, but Goleman found direct ties between emotional intelligence and measurable business results.\n\nThe Harvard Business Review Classics series offers you the opportunity to make seminal Harvard Business Review articles a part of your permanent management library.

To be successful, leaders need to sort out what's important, devise strategies based on their own point of view, and get there ahead of the crowd. But most leaders today are just concerned about getting there in time. Many are even willing to settle for getting there fashionably late. They focus on quick-fix problems, avoiding the kinds long-term of dilemmas that will characterize the future. But as Institute for the Future's ten-year forecast—which is included in the book—makes clear, today's leaders face more and more dilemmas: recurring, complex, messy, and puzzling.Bob Johansen shares techniques refined over nearly forty years by the Institute of the Future to help you navigate your own organization's road to the future. He details real-world examples of how organizations like Procter & Gamble, Disney, Reuters, UPS, and the Centers for Disease Control have put these approaches into practice. Through fascinating and illustrative examples—including the Toyota Prius, the iPod, Crest Toothpaste, and many more—he shows that getting there early means finding new markets, new customers, and new products ahead of your competitors. It means anticipating the needs of your stakeholders. It means you'll be able to establish a position before your late-arriving competitors even have a chance to organize. It helps you think through what might happen and what should happen. It gives you time to consider alternative strategies. Ultimately, getting there early helps you see beyond the problems of the present and recognize possible futures before others do. Get There Early lays out the Institute's three-step Foresight to Insight to Action Cycle that allows you to sense, make sense of, and win when faced with dilemmas.

Not according to John Gabarro and John Kotter. In this handy guidebook, the authors contend that you manage your boss for a very good reason: to do your best on the job—and thereby benefit not only yourself but also your supervisor and your entire company. Your boss depends on you for cooperation, reliability, and honesty. And you depend on him or her for links to the rest of the organization, for setting priorities, and for obtaining critical resources. By managing your boss—clarifying your own and your supervisor's strengths, weaknesses, goals, work styles, and needs—you cultivate a relationship based on mutual respect and understanding. The result? A healthy, productive bond that enables you both to excel. Gabarro and Kotter provide valuable guidelines for building this essential relationship—including strategies for determining how your boss prefers to process information and make decisions, tips for communicating mutual expectations, and tactics for negotiating priorities. Thought provoking and practical, Managing Your Boss enables you to lay the groundwork for one of the most crucial working relationships you'll have in your career.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Team Management"]},{"id":"9780071813006","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Big Book of Team Coaching Games: Quick, Effective Activities to Energize, Motivate, and Guide Your Team to Success","authors":["Mary Scannell","Mike Mulvihill","Joanne Schlosser"],"pages":"224","publication_date":"July 2013","description":"The fun and effective way to BOOST ENGAGEMENT and PRODUCTIVITY\n\nTeams that enjoy working together operate on a whole different energy level than teams that don't.

That dude may not even be a business leader! They might be a marine, a mountain climber, or a politician. Their stories might inspire you to summit Everest, but they're not going to help you figure out the looming company merger or what to do with that struggling manager\n\nIn Leadership Wise, Chief Product Officer at Podium, John Foreman, delivers a different and refreshingly practical take on business leadership. The author moves beyond what a leader should look like, to discuss how you can make better decisions over time to help your organization accomplish its goals. Regardless of a reader's personality and background, John provides practical advice for how anyone can become a great leader just as they are by making more effective decisions over and over again. It's not about becoming a 5-star general or a mythical titan of industry, it's about making better decisions more often.

If so, you are not alone. According to The Boston Consulting Group’s fascinating Complexity Index, business complexity has increased sixfold during the past sixty years. And, all the while, organizational complicatedness—that is, the number of structures, processes, committees, decision-making forums, and systems—has increased by a whopping factor of thirty-five. In their attempt to respond to the increasingly complex performance requirements they face, company leaders have created an organizational labyrinth that makes it more and more difficult to improve productivity and to pursue innovation. It also disengages and demotivates the workforce.Clearly it’s time for leaders to stop trying to manage complexity with their traditional tools and instead better leverage employees' intelligence. This book shows you how and explains the implications for designing and leading organizations. The way to manage complexity, the authors argue, is neither with the hard solutions of another era nor with the soft solutions—such as team building and feel-good “people initiatives”—that often follow in their wake. Based on social sciences (notably economics, game theory, and organizational sociology) and The Boston Consulting Group’s work with more than five hundred companies in more than forty countries and in various industries, authors Yves Morieux and Peter Tollman recommend six simple rules to manage complexity without getting complicated.Showing why the rules work and how to put them into practice, Morieux and Tollman give managers a much-needed tool to reinvigorate people in the face of seemingly endless complexity. Included are detailed examples from companies that have achieved a multiplicative effect on performance by using them.It’s time to manage complexity better. Employ these six simple rules to foster autonomy and cooperation and to effectively handle business complexity. As a result, you will improve productivity, innovate more, reengage your workforce, and seize opportunities to create competitive advantage.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management"]},{"id":"9781843984559","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Developing Leadership and Management Skills","authors":["Jeffrey Gold","Lisa Anderson"],"pages":"96","publication_date":"July 2017","description":"Design and deliver effective leadership and management development programmes","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management"]},{"id":"53863MIT59449","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Getting Smarter About Strategy","authors":["MIT Sloan Management Review"],"pages":"122","publication_date":"July 2018","description":"How can executives make themselves smarter about strategy?

It turns out that it’s not. On August 20, 1991, Hollis Harris, the CEO of struggling Continental Airlines told his 42,000 employees to pray for the future of the company. The next day he was fired. What Hollis did was vulnerable, but it was not leadership.\n\nWhile vulnerability cripples some leaders, others tap into it and use it as a superpower. Vulnerability alone makes leaders seem incompetent. Competence on its own makes it hard for leaders to connect with their people. The key is to develop both competence and vulnerability, what Jacob calls “The Vulnerable Leader Equation.”\n\nBased on over 100 CEO interviews and a survey of nearly 14,000 employees, renowned leadership thought leader and futurist Jacob Morgan shares candid stories and original research that shows how leaders can tap into vulnerability to transform themselves, their teams, and their organizations.\n\nThis book will show you why it’s so crucial to lead with vulnerability and how to do it well. You will learn:\n\nThe difference between being vulnerable and leading with vulnerability\nThe 5 vulnerable leader superheroes\nWhat makes leaders feel most vulnerable at work and why\nThe ROI of leading with vulnerability\nThe 8 attributes of vulnerable leaders\nWhat happens when vulnerability is used against you\nHow to climb the “vulnerability mountain”\nWhat keeps leaders from being vulnerable at work and how to overcome it\n\nLeading With Vulnerability is not just a book to share with your leaders and your co-workers.

When leaders start encouraging questions from their teams, however, they begin to see amazing results. Knowing the right questions to ask—and the right way to listen—will give any leader the skills to perform well in any situation, effectively communicate a vision to the team, and achieve lasting success across the organization.\n\nThoroughly revised and updated, Leading with Questions will help you encourage participation and teamwork, foster outside-the-box thinking, empower others, build relationships with customers, solve problems, and more.

He outlines specific techniques of active listening and follow-up, and helps you understand how questions can improve the way you work with individuals, teams, and organizations.\n\nThis new edition of Leading with Questions draws on interviews with thirty leaders, including eight whose stories are new to this edition. These interviews tell stories from a range of countries, including Singapore, Guyana, Korea, and Switzerland, and feature case studies from prominent firms such as DuPont, Alcoa, Novartis, and Cargill. A new chapter on problem-solving will help you apply questions to your toughest situations as a leader, and a new \"Questions for Reflection\" section at the end of each chapter will help you bring Marquardt's message into all of your work as a leader.\n\nNow more than ever, Leading with Questions is the definitive guide for becoming a stronger leader by identifying—and asking—the right questions.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781626565685","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Doing the Right Things Right","authors":["Laura Stack","William A.

Yet some CEOs deliver their greatest successes when times get toughestwhen customers’ preferences are shifting away from a company’s products, when new regulations are shrinking profit margins, when political unrest is destroying supply lines.In Better Under Pressure, Justin Menkes reveals the common traits that make these leaders successful. Drawing on in-depth interviews with sixty CEOs from an array of industries and performance data from two hundred other leaders, Menkes shows that great executives strive relentlessly to maximize their own potentialas well as stoke their people’s innate thirst for their own triumphs. To do so, they draw on a set of three essential and rare attributes: Realistic optimism: They recognize the risks threatening their organization’s survivaland their own failingswhile remaining confident in their ability to have an impact. Subservience to purpose: They dedicate themselves to pursuing a noble cause and win their team’s commitment to that cause. Finding order in chaos: They find clarity amid the many variables affecting their business by culling data and forming the conclusions that matter most to the company.The good news: these three capabilities can be learned. Drawing on a broad range of examples from real companiesincluding Avon, Yum Brands, Southwest, Procter & Gamble, and Ryerson Steel, to name just a fewMenkes demonstrates how each psychological attribute manifests itself in real life and enables top performance under extreme duress. He also shows you how to develop and deploy those attributesso you can transform yourself into a leader who only shines brighter as the pressure intensifies.Deeply personal, brimming with compelling stories from real-life CEOs, and packed with powerful insights, tools, and practices, this book is a potent resource for aspiring, emerging, and seasoned business leaders alike.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781259588624","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Million Dollar Consulting, 5th Edition","authors":["Alan Weiss"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"April 2016","description":"Build a thriving consultancy with the updated edition of this classic bestseller\n\nHaving inspired generations of consultants and entrepreneurs around the world, the “Rock Star of Consulting” Alan Weiss returns with a revised and completely updated edition of his authoritative guide to consulting success. \n\nWeiss provides his time-tested model on creating a flourishing consulting business, while incorporating and focusing on the many dynamic changes in solo and boutique consulting, coaching, and entrepreneurship.

The rapid pace of change demands fast and flexible responses throughout the organization-there's no time to wait for directives from the top. And the highly-skilled workers so vital to organizational success also demand a high degree of independence. Old-fashioned command-and-control leadership is just too slow and stifling.Charles Manz and Henry Sims, Jr. pioneered the concept self-leadership in their bestselling book SuperLeadership. In The New SuperLeadership, the authors present new content and examples designed to help leaders develop the kind of autonomous, quick-reacting workforce necessary to thrive in these turbulent times. This enriched and expanded edition takes the concepts in the first edition to another level by emphasizing a pragmatic, how-to approach for developing leaders at every level of the organization.Drawing on contemporary examples and profiles, many from the high-tech and information sectors, Manz and Sims shatter the myth of the traditional, aggrandized versions of \"heroic\" leadership. They show that a leader truly becomes successful by turning followers into extraordinary self-leaders-pillars of strength that will support the organization at every level. They detail a series of action-oriented steps through which the SuperLeader provides an opportunity for followers to express and develop their own leadership skills-and in the process become highly motivated, dynamic contributors.The New SuperLeadership critically reviews traditional leadership styles, vividly illustrating the drawbacks of each: the \"Strong Man\" whose reliance on fear-based compliance smothers initiative; the \"Transactor\" who promotes a narrow \"what's in it for me?\" mentality; and the \"Visionary Hero\" whose powerful personality inspires commitment but inadvertently discourages independent thinking. By bringing out the leader in every employee, SuperLeadership enables leaders to avoid these pitfalls and develop an enthusiastic, innovative and energized workforce.The New SuperLeadership is a radically new way of looking at leadership, offering a leadership paradigm ideally suited to the realities of the modern workplace. It reveals that the only way to succeed today is to tap into the innate leadership potential that lies within every employee.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9780071626149","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Coach Wooden's Leadership Game Plan for Success: 12 Lessons for Extraordinary Performance and Personal Excellence","authors":["John Wooden","Steve Jamison"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"April 2009","description":"“Each member of your team has the potential for personal greatness; the leader’s job is to help them achieve it.” —JOHN WOODEN\n\nCoach Wooden’s Leadership Game Plan for Success presents a unique opportunity to study under the man ESPN hails as “the greatest coach of the 20th century.” Practicing character-based leadership before the term was invented, John Wooden consistently led his legendary teams to victory and has since taught countless business leaders his fundamentals for achieving and sustaining success.\n\nNow, using this hands-on book based on the acclaimed John Wooden Leadership Course©, you can “interact” with Coach to learn and apply his philosophy of world-class leadership.

First, you must produce a quality product on schedule and on budget. Second, you must foster and encourage a cohesive, motivated, and smoothly operating team. And third, you must maintain a clear and consistent focus on short- and long-term goals, while exemplifying quality standards and showing confidence and enthusiasm for your team and its efforts. Most importantly, as a leader, you need to feel and act responsible for your team and everything that it does.\n\nAccomplishing all these goals in a way that is rewarding for the leader and the team--while producing the results that management wants--is the motivation behind the Team Software Process (TSP). Developed by renowned quality expert Watts S. Humphrey, TSP is a set of new practices and team concepts that helps developers take the CMM and CMMI Capability Maturity Models to the next level. Not only does TSP help make software more secure, it results in an average production gain of 68 percent per project. Because of their quality, timeliness, and security, TSP-produced products can be ten to hundreds of times better than other hardware or software.\n\nIn this essential guide to TSP, Humphrey uses his vast industry experience to show leaders precisely how to lead teams of software engineers trained in the Personal Software Process (PSP). He explores all aspects of effective leadership and teamwork, including building the right team for the job, the TSP launch process, following the process to produce a quality product, project reviews, and capitalizing on both the leader's and team's capabilities. Humphrey also illuminates the differences between an ineffective leader and a superb one with the objective of helping you understand, anticipate, and correct the most common leadership failings before they undermine the team.\n\nAn extensive set of appendices provides additional detail on TSP team roles and shows you how to use an organization's communication and command networks to achieve team objectives.\n\nWhether you are a new or an experienced team leader, TSPSM: Leading a Development Team provides invaluable examples, guidelines, and suggestions on how to handle the many issues you and your team face together.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781118841303","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Courage to Execute: What elite U.S. military units can teach business about leadership and team performance","authors":["James D.

In response, the authors note, executives are showing a new interest in scenario planning. Rather than tying their company’s future to a strategy geared to one set of events, executives are coming to the view that smart management benefits from a richer understanding of the present possibilities afforded from multiple views about possible futures. Scenario planning came to prominence following World War II and gained recognition in the corporate world in the late 1960s and early 1970s. While several different approaches to scenario planning have emerged since then, this article focuses specifically on the Oxford scenario planning approach. Rather than taking a probabilistic stance (that is, making predictions in percentage terms or as best-case/worst-case scenarios) or a normative stance (that is, envisioning what a future should look like), the Oxford scenario methodology is based on plausibility. By recognizing the part of uncertainty that is unpredictable and by actively exploring the sources of the turbulence and uncertainty, the goal is to iteratively and interactively generate new knowledge and insights to help organizations reperceive their circumstances. During periods of turbulence, unpredictable uncertainty, novelty, and ambiguity (what the authors refer to as TUNA conditions), organizations frequently experience serious challenges that threaten existing value chains, communities, and even whole fields of endeavor. Such conditions can be unsettling and destabilizing on many different levels. A core feature in the Oxford scenario planning approach is making a distinction between the immediate business environment an organization inhabits (where business transactions take place) and the broader environment, or context, in which it operates. Different organizations go about scenario planning in different ways — there is no cookie-cutter methodology, the authors write. This article examines two cases. The first case involves Rolls-Royce plc, a leading supplier of power systems for aircraft and the marine and energy markets; the second case looks at the Royal Society of Chemistry, a London, U.K.-based international organization involved in advancing the field of chemical sciences. In addition to showing how these organizations used scenario planning, the authors discuss the challenges and opportunities of scenario planning more broadly.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Strategic Thinking"]},{"id":"9781259835414","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"People First Leadership: How the Best Leaders Use Culture and Emotion to Drive Unprecedented Results","authors":["Eduardo P.

Still others fail to have the courage and the belief system that support the high value delivered to clients, thereby reducing fees to a level commensurate with the consultant's own low self-esteem.

James Wilson"],"pages":"288","publication_date":"September 2011","description":"In years past, the keywords for leaders were confidence, single-minded purpose, and strategic planning. But today's vastly complex, globalized, and fast-evolving world requires a different kind of leadership. This game-changing book details a new approach—entrepreneurial leadership—developed at Babson College, the number-one school for entrepreneurship in the world. Entrepreneurial leadership is inspired by, but is separate from, entrepreneurship. It can be applied in any organizational situation, not just start-ups. Based on two years of extensive research, it embraces three principles that add up to a fundamentally new worldview of business and a new logic of decision making. First, rapid change and increasing uncertainty require leaders to be “cognitively ambidextrous,” able to shift between traditional “prediction logic” (choosing actions based on analysis) and “creation logic” (taking action despite considerable unknowns). Guiding this different way of thinking and acting is a new view of business, where simultaneous creation of social, environmental, and economic value is the order of the day. Finally, entrepreneurial leaders leverage their understanding of themselves and their social context to guide effective action. Each chapter offers concrete examples of how educators across all disciplines are integrating these ideas into their courses—and even their entire curricula. The New Entrepreneurial Leader lays out a comprehensive new paradigm for reinventing management education in order to mold leaders who will shape social and economic opportunity.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9780470623893","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Designing Effective Work Groups","authors":["Paul S.

It is timeless virtue that creates sustainable value.\n\nThoughtful leaders are keenly aware of the enormous challenge they face to drive high performance in a world that continues to ratchet up pressure and uncertainty. Some leaders respond by getting tough and establishing strict rules. They get people in line, but they don’t inspire excellence. Wise leaders, on the other hand, help their people practice character to navigate their way through the turbulence—without lowering performance expectations. As a result, their people are more reliable under pressure.\n\nException to the Rule links ancient wisdom with contemporary science on high performance, teamwork, and engagement. Building an organizational culture based on classical virtues– of trust, compassion, courage, justice, wisdom, temperance and hope - is both strategically smart and a better way to live.\n\nException to the Rule walks you through the steps of helping everyone in your organization focus on character defined by virtue. The word virtue means excellence, which is why each one is essential to help people perform at a high level despite uncertainty and pressure. Under character--based leadership, teams work better together, creativity flourishes and engagement increases.\n\nThe most powerful idea of Exception to the Rule is this: character defined by virtue is not based on birthright; it can be learned and practiced. Everyone can develop habits to become better than they were. While character cannot be legislated, character can be cultivated.\n\nAs virtue proves its value, the culture you have can evolve into the culture you need.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9789332510456","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"21 Success Sutras for Leaders","authors":["M.

NOW IT'S TIME TO EXECUTE.\n\nBusinesses spend a combined total of $47 billion annually on strategy consulting. Approximately 90 percent of strategic change initiatives fail to deliver the intended results.\n\nSomething isn't adding up.\n\nAs companies all over the world concentrate on revisiting, revising, and remaking their strategies, they forget the next step: making sure the strategy happens. So it turns out that billions of dollars are spent on brilliant ideas--but not brilliant results.\n\nIn this groundbreaking book, business strategy experts Liz Mellon and Simon Carter provide a solution: THE STRATEGY OF EXECUTION. The authors break down the process of ensuring that your new strategy translates into measurable profits and growth into five fundamental and profoundly important steps:\n\nMOBILIZE THE VILLAGE: Get your senior executives to embrace the new strategy and actively engage with it.\nGATHER THE ELDERS: Build a small team of the very highest figures in the corporation to lead strategic change.\nPOWER UP FEELING: Don't overthink it; trust your instincts as much as your intellect.\nENERGIZE PEOPLE: Create a culture of communication, ownership, and followthrough of strategic objectives.\nBUILD ENDURANCE: Drive individual and organizational resilience to play the long game and hardwire change throughout systems and organizational structures to maintain momentum.\n\nIn the final chapter, the authors illustrate their process in action through a detailed case study of BPB PLC--a century-old building material company that applied these five steps to make extraordinary strategic change happen.\n\nYou can lead positive change in your company. A strategy is just words on paper until it's executed with care and smarts. Use The Strategy of Execution as a blueprint for long-term business success.\n\nThere are a lot of smart people coming up with innovative business strategies today.

The Strategy of Execution provides a practical approach to the work that must be done after a business strategy is agreed upon.\n\n\"This is a highly readable guide to one of the most under-researched areas of strategy; execution.

Your ability to be resilient—to pick yourself up after setbacks and keep on going no matter the challenges—is critical not only to successful leadership but also to fostering teams, generating collaboration, and igniting your organization. In this breakthrough book, veteran consultants Joan McArthur-Blair and Jeanie Cockell show that Appreciative Inquiry can be an invaluable tool to build that resilience.Appreciative Inquiry is a time-tested, highly effective, and widely used change method that emphasizes identifying what's working well in a system and building on those strengths. Originating in the 1980s, it's been responsible for dramatic results in every conceivable type of organization. Using the authors' Appreciative Resilience model, leaders can use AI to increase their ability to weather the storms they'll inevitably face and come out stronger. A profoundly practical guide, this book features first-person accounts from leaders in all kinds of settings and situations describing how they've used AI concepts to increase their resilience, as well as a detailed description of the exercises and practices the authors use in their Appreciative Resilience Workshop. McArthur-Blair and Cockell believe that the core of resilience is the interplay among despair, hope, and forgiveness. Every leader experiences despair in those moments when there is no clear path forward. Maintaining hope that a better future is possible enables leaders to keep going. And forgiveness, of one's own shortcomings and those of others, helps leaders move from despair to hope. AI's focus on the best of what is and using that to generate the future makes it a particularly powerful aid and ally on this journey.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781484263006","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Leadership in a Time of Continuous Technological Change: Align, Strengthen, and Mobilize Your Team","authors":["Bar Schwartz"],"pages":"122","publication_date":"September 2020","description":"Digital technology is rapidly challenging the way we do business, interact with our communities, and learn about the world.

Human beingsalso have a tendency to think and act hierarchically. In fact, hierarchies — distinct differences in groupmembers' power and status — can be found in virtually every human group, from children on the playground to executives in the boardroom. Although many people have argued that flat organizationspromote innovative thinking, the authors maintain that a properly deployed hierarchy can help teamsengage in and get the most out of their efforts to learn and innovate.Specifically, the authors observe that hierarchies help teams generate, identify, and select new ideasby performing three critical functions: bounding solutions, converging ideas, and structuring processes.\"A paradox of creativity,\" the authors write, \"is that people are more innovative when they have clearconstraints (such as time, budget, customer requirements, etc.) within which their solutions must fit.\"Early on, teams tend to come up with an array of ideas and possibilities. Hierarchies, the authorsexplain, can help sort through which ideas should be pursued and which ones are less promising.The authors provide three recommendations for leaders seeking to leverage the power of hierarchyon teams and avoid its pitfalls. First, organizations should have a clear chain of command. In one study,teams with a clear chain of command were less likely to get bogged down in conflicts and stalematesthan other teams.Second, organizations need to create performance-based cultures in which performance gets measured,publicized, and celebrated. Hierarchies in performance-based cultures are more likely to be basedon expertise, and that can counteract unconscious biases against women and minorities.Third, people at the top of the organization should act in ways that support group goals as opposedto promoting their own interests. Citing a study one of the authors participated in, they write:\"Hierarchies promoted learning and performance when goals and feedback were group-oriented, butthey stifled learning and performance when goals and feedback were individually oriented.\"","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Strategic Thinking"]},{"id":"9780749481032","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Leader's Guide to Lateral Thinking Skills, 3rd Edition","authors":["Paul Sloane"],"pages":"208","publication_date":"September 2017","description":"Improve your lateral thinking skills, boost the creativity of your team and kick start innovation in your organisation.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Team Management"]},{"id":"9780135094020","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Helping People Win at Work","authors":["Garry Ridge","Ken Blanchard"],"pages":"192","publication_date":"April 2009","description":"Ken Blanchard’s Leading at a Higher Level techniques are inspiring thousands of leaders to build high-performing organizations that make life better for everyone.

For years I’ve been concerned about how people’s performance is evaluated. People are often forced into a normal distribution curve, or even worse, rank ordered. Not only does this not build trust, it also does not hold managers responsible for coaching people and helping them win. The manager’s responsibility is focused on sorting people out.\n\nWhen I was a college professor, I always gave my students the final exam at the beginning of the course and spent the rest of the semester helping them answer the questions so that they could get an A. Life is all about getting As, not some stupid normal distribution curve. Garry Ridge got this, and wow! What a difference it has made in WD-40 Company’s performance.”\n\n--Ken Blanchard\n\n“When I first heard Ken talk about giving his final exam at the beginning of the course and then teaching students the answers so they could get an A, it blew me away.

Leadership is a living process—and life means growth. As Ken Blanchard and Mark Miller write in the introduction, “the path to increased influence, impact, and leadership effectiveness is paved with personal growth.… Our capacity to grow determines our capacity to lead. It's really that simple.” Great Leaders Grow shows leaders and aspiring leaders precisely which areas to focus on so they can remain effective throughout their lives.Debbie Brewster—the protagonist from Blanchard and Miller's international bestseller The Secret—returns in this book to mentor her mentor's son, Blake, as he begins his career. Now an accomplished leader herself, Debbie shows Blake how growing as a leader and as a human being are inextricably linked. “How well you and I serve will be determined by the decision to grow or not,” she says. “Will you be a leader who is always ready to face the next challenge? Or will you be a leader who tries to apply yesterday's solutions to today's problems?” As Blake confronts the challenges of business in the real world, he turns to Debbie for guidance. Step by step, Debbie and Blake explore the GROW model—four ways that leaders must challenge and stretch themselves, both on the job and off, to fulfill their highest potential. Whether you're a CEO or an entry-level employee, this book will inspire you to reflect on your life and design your own long-term growth plan—a plan that can lead not only to continuing professional success but to personal fulfillment as well.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781605093413","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Go Team!","authors":["Ken Blanchard","Alan Randolph","Peter Grazier"],"pages":"143","publication_date":"June 2007","description":"All of us in the today's workforce are called upon more and more to work effectively in teams.

In this book, self-management expert Samantha Slade presents seven concrete practices to help your organization flatten its existing hierarchy and develop a horizontal organization. The result will be enhanced creativity, greater growth, and a increased employee retention and productivity—and a better bottom line.These days, more than ever, successful organizations must respond quickly and nimbly to change—they need every employee's best thinking. A horizontal organization creates an environment of true collaboration, respect, and openness. It allows everyone more freedom to express unconventional ideas or to work through issues that are getting in the way of organizational goals. And it's a more human way to organize—after all, we function perfectly well in our day-to day lives without someone telling us what to do. But when an organization decides to go horizontal, it can be overwhelming for both managers and employees. Slade offers a practical, proven, incremental method to help organizations of all kinds and sizes ease in to a non-hierarchical model. She includes techniques for using your organization's purpose to stay focused and aligned, developing shared decision-making, creating a mutual feedback culture, nurturing autonomy, holding co-managed meetings, and maintaining an environment of collective learning.

MacArthur's extraordinary life of leadership spanned three wars and more than six decades inside and outside the military. He defined principles of leadership that were decades ahead of their time: principles reflecting extraordinary wisdom about strategy, motivation, organization, execution, and personal growth.

Those extraordinary achievements arose directly from MacArthur's singular approach to leadership.  This book reveals what MacArthur knew about defining victory and setting the right priorities for achieving it; building sleek, fast-response organizations; inspiring subordinates to unprecedented performance; focusing relentlessly on results; transforming organizational culture to value speed, knowledge, and honor; pursuing personal excellence; and winning.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781119464426","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Extraordinary Influence","authors":["Tim Irwin","Tim Tassopoulos"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"March 2018","description":"The age-old question for every leader—how do we bring out the best in those we lead? Anyone who has run a company, raised a family, lead an army, or coached a team struggles to find the key to help others excel and realize their potential. It is surprising how often we resort to criticism vs. an approach that actually results in a better worker and a better person. \n\nWhat if we could speak Words of Life that transform those under our influence and ignite fires of intrinsic motivation? What if those we lead found great purpose in what they do and worked at their jobs with all their heart? Isn’t that what leaders, parents and teachers really want? Ultimately, don’t we hope to foster intrinsic motivation so that the individuals we lead become better employees, better students or better athletes? Recent discoveries of brain science and the wisdom of top CEO’s that Dr. Tim Irwin interviewed for this book give us the answers we’ve long sought.\n\nIn most organizations, the methods used to provide feedback to employees such as performance appraisal or multi-rater feedback systems, in fact, accomplish the exact opposite of what we intend. We inadvertently speak Words of Death. Brain science tells us that these methods tend to engage a natural “negativity bias” that is hardwired in us all.\n\nScience in recent years discovered that affirmation sets in motion huge positive changes in the brain. It releases certain neuro chemicals associated with well-being and higher performance. Amazingly, criticism creates just the opposite neural reaction. The most primitive part of the brain goes into hyper defense mode, compromising our performance, torpedoing our motivation and limiting access to our higher-order strengths.\n\nHow do we redirect employees who are out-of-line without engaging our natural “negativity bias?” Leaders must forever ban the term, “Constructive Criticism.” Brain science tells us that we can establish a connection between the employee’s work and his or her aspirations. This book calls for a new approach to align workers with an organization’s mission, strategy and goals, called Alliance Feedback.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9780071754934","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Manager's Guide to Virtual Teams","authors":["Kimball Fisher","Mareen Fisher"],"pages":"256","publication_date":"June 2011","description":"Get solid collaboration from team members in remote locations\n\nGlobalization and new technologies have made team collaboration from distant geographical locations—on the road, from home or client sites, even on the other side of the globe—a routine part of business.

Regardless of the manner in which their company's fractures manifest themselves, however, corporate leaders must find a way to rid their workplaces of the divisions that threaten to undermine their company's productivity, profits, and survival. That's why, in Unite the Tribes, bestselling author Christopher Duncan provides corporate leaders with a ten-step plan for joining their company's divided ranks together in a way that helps employees achieve their goals while also accomplishing those of the company.\n\nUsing the metaphors of the company as empire and the disparate groups that form within companies as tribes, Duncan explains that the formation of tribes within an empire is unavoidable, and to some extent, it may even be natural. After all, regardless of the situation in which they find themselves, human beings are social creatures that have aligned themselves with those whose goals and motivations match their own for centuries. The job of corporate leaders, however, is to build a cohesive, powerful, and enduring empire—which is why, in Unite the Tribes: Leadership Skills for Technology Managers, Duncan reveals:\n\nHow to build alliances and a spirit of unity across all levels of a company in order to achieve higher employee morale, greater profits, and increased productivity;\n\nHow to effectively communicate to employees the reality that their long-term prosperity as individuals operating within a company depends upon the long-term prosperity of the company itself;\n\nThe many forms of conflict that can form both within and without a organization;\n\nHow to discover what truly fulfills employees of a company and help them acquire it;\n\nAnd much more.\n\nWith Unite the Tribes as their guide, corporate leaders will learn that the way that great empires of the past have been established has been through the efforts of visionary leaders who understood that they could prevail only when they were able to convince their tribes of a simple but crucial truth: Alone, you are weak and vulnerable. United, you are invincible.\n\nWhat you'll learn\n\nReaders of Unite the Tribes will learn:\n\nPractical, down-to-earth approaches to problem solving and productivity that make sense to corporate leaders who have to do real work in the real world.\n\nHow to arrive at a plan for uniting the disparate groups that operate within their company when faced with the daily reality of office politics, maneuvering, ambition, incompetence, and short-term thinking.\n\nHow to convey the company's purpose to employees in a way that is realistic and meaningful so that all workers can contribute to the company's greater good.\n\nHow the Ten Pillars of the Empire (Vision; Leadership; Organization; Mobility; Competitiveness; Persuasion; Strategy; Brilliance; Morale; Unification) can help their employees and their company achieve their individual and joint goals.\n\nWho this book is for\n\nRegardless of the industry in which their company operates, those serving in leadership or managerial capacities (i.e., those overseeing one or more employees) at workplaces plagued with division and dysfunction will find the solutions they need to rally their employees to join forces in Unite the Tribes.

Goldsmith and his co-authors first identify five new \"factors of leadership\" and their implications: global thinking, appreciation of diversity, technological savvy, a willingness to partner and an openness to sharing leadership. They explain what it will mean to lead in an era where intellectual capital is the dominant source of value; how to lead people whose backgrounds and values may be radically dissimilar from yours; and why achieving personal self-mastery is now a fundamental prerequisite for leading others.\n\nFrom the evolution of \"federated,\" semi-autonomous organizational structures to the personal leadership challenges now arising from globalism, this book offers unprecedented insights into the new challenges of leadership--and what it will take to meet them.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781780172873","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Women in IT","authors":["BCS, The Chartered Institute for IT"],"pages":"96","publication_date":"October 2014","description":"Gender diversity still poses a major challenge in the IT and telecoms industry, with women making up less than 20 per cent of the IT workforce.

While acknowledging that generational stereotypes exist, author Jessica Kriegel argues that they are wrong—and that it's unreasonable to assume that the millions of people born in the same 20-year time span are motivated by the same things, attracted to the same things, and should be dealt with in the same way. Kriegel's experience as Organizational Developer at Oracle puts her squarely in the talent strategy realm, where she works to optimize leadership development, team effectiveness, and organizational design. Drawing upon her experiences with workers of all ages and types, she shows how behaviors know no generational boundaries and how to work with people based on their talents, strengths, and weaknesses rather than simply slapping on a generational label and fitting them into an arbitrary slot.\n\nThere are 80 million Millenials in America, yet there are myriad books on \"managing Millenials\" and \"working with Millenials\" and \"the problem with Millenials.\" This book shows that whether you're working with Millenials, Generation X, or Baby Boomers, age is not the issue—it's the interpersonal dynamics that matter most.\n\nExamine the concept of \"generational issues\"\nExplore the disparate reality of each 20-year generational span\nLearn to understand and work effectively with other generations\nFacilitate intergenerational understanding sessions\n\nThe human mind craves categorization, so the tendency to lump people together is natural.

Alan Briskin shows how the modern organization has gradually increased its demands on us-beginning with our bodies, then our minds, and now our souls. But through the moving personal stories of people fighting to reclaim their souls, he also sends a message that encourages individuals to keep their spiritual integrity and values alive.In The Stirring of Soul In the Workplace, Briskin weaves together lessons from history, psychology, and management theory, with numerous real-life examples, to tell the story of how the modern workplace has evolved to value technology and productivity over soulfulness and relationship. From the Industrial Revolution's marriage of mechanization and efficiency to the management theories of the early 20th century, Briskin traces the emergence of the quest for efficiency and control in the workplace. He questions the corporate concept of \"individual personality\" that asks us to check our emotions, fantasies, imaginations, and souls at the door. He describes the history of the soul as a dynamic force that continues to influence our behavior, and shows how excluding it from our work life actually flattens our potential and dampens our creativity.Rather than solve the conventional question organizations have been asking for years-how can we change people?-Alan Briskin examines how organizations can better reflect personal and human values in the workplace. For organizations that too often have sacrificed the well-being of the individual for the goals of the organization, the author suggests a more active way of taking up our work roles that can bring more of our experience and imagination into play. He points out that meaning cannot come from corporate mission statements or reengineering programs. Instead, it needs to be nurtured through dialogue and reflection, the courage to ask troubling questions, and a willingness to face the consequences of our collective and individual actions. When we learn to honor the contradictions, uncertainties, and interconnections inherent in the workplace, the energies of the soul will begin to stir with revitalizing results.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Culture in Business"]},{"id":"9781605093949","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"The Answer to How Is Yes","authors":["Peter Block"],"pages":"216","publication_date":"November 2003","description":"Modern culture’s worship of “how-to” pragmatism has turned us into instruments of efficiency and commerce—but we’re doing more and more about things that mean less and less.

The reason is simple: no matter what you think you're saying, your words, gestures, and tone of voice can actually communicate something entirely different.\n\nToo often, negative micromessages undermine morale, business opportunities, and ultimately your organization. Micromessaging examines the nuanced behaviors that we all blindly use and react to in our dealings with others.

Learning how to constructively address these behaviors can bring about positive change.\n\nYoung offers a common language for encouraging open discussion in the workplace, along with skills to identify and address familiar micromessages; tools for deploying microadvantages; and real-life workplace scenarios, self-assessments, and solutions that help readers interpret and alter ingrained behaviors and their effects.

Something was standing in their way—usually the unwillingness or inability to make a critical decision. They thought they needed more—more education, more experience, more time, or more data. They had enough of these, but they lacked the confidence, courage, and optimism to make the tough calls. Through our work together, we learned that when leaders make good decisions, little else matters. When they refuse to make decisions, or show a pattern of making bad ones, nothing else matters. The most successful leaders realized they could no longer push growth. Instead, they had to remove barriers to success—obstacles they had erected themselves. The compelling stories and surprising research findings in this book focus on real people who actively sought professional improvement and personal development. Working together, we mapped out their journeys, identified roadblocks, recognized the wrong turns they had taken, and unlocked their decision-making potential—in some cases, more than doubling the size of their companies. Most of these stories illustrate how and why these leaders succeed, but others serve as warnings about what can happen when leaders refuse to decide.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management"]},{"id":"9781422172612","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Executing Strategy","authors":["Harvard Business Review"],"pages":"128","publication_date":"August 2009","description":"Every day on the job, you face common challenges.

Succeeding Generations explores leadership transitions in family businesses, offering a clear-eyed assessment of the different options, from direct succession to building partnerships between siblings and cousins.Family-owned companies may dominate the worldwide business landscape, yet surprisingly few are successfully passed down from one generation to the next, and fewer still reach the third generation intact. Author Ivan Lansberg, an organizational psychologist who grew up in a family business, examines the reasons behind this high failure rate and reveals the factors that contribute to long-term success. He offers practical advice on how to mentor successors, how to set up a systematic selection process, and how to make the best use of the board of directors during times of transition.With a wealth of examples from companies in the United States, Europe, and Latin America, Succeeding Generations provides a thoughtful and comprehensive look at the sensitive dynamics of leadership succession in family businesses.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Culture in Business"]},{"id":"9780749482510","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Coach's Coach","authors":["Alison Hardingham"],"pages":"216","publication_date":"September 2004","description":"Professional coaches and trainers, specialist consultants and coaching managers, and HR professionals.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Executive Coaching"]},{"id":"9781947441194","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Creating Leadership","authors":["Philip Goodwin","Tony Page"],"pages":"154","publication_date":"February 2018","description":"This informative and inspirational handbook describes how to successfully lead mergers and change in complex organizations.

No matter what their focus may be—professional services, accounting, technology, operations, human resources, manufacturing, or marketing—consultants drive change. That change, from its initial definition through its development and deployment, must be precisely communicated to a variety of audiences and through a variety of mediums. Most business communication books do a good job leading professional writers and presenters through the basics of audience, organization, formatting, and mechanics. But, only few focus on a specific business role, such as that of a consultant, and give guidance for communicating during all stages of a project. From the pre-engagement process, to the actual engagement, to the post-engagement follow-up, consultants are challenged by the variety of audiences whose roles continually shift throughout a project. This book guides a current or would-be consultant through the various phases of a typical engagement and gives practical advice and direction on written and oral communication throughout a project. Current and future consultants in all fields will gain specific knowledge about writing and presenting to a variety of audiences including clients, team members, managers, and executives.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Consulting"]},{"id":"9781948580557","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Insightful Quality, Second Edition","authors":["Victor E.

Regardless of their titles and nominal responsibilities, they will confront situations in which they have insufficient influence and authority to get their job done effectively. Fortunately, two strategies can almost always help the sidelined executive capture more clout and build an enduring power base.A variety of situations can lead a manager into a power deficit. Demographics (race, ethnicity, gender or age) can contribute to the power-deficient executive’s predicament, as can inexperience, poor reputation, personality, background, training or outlook. It can happen to people with high potential. It can even happen to executives who are already high performers.Typically, an executive winds up with a power deficit because he or she lacks one or more of the following power sources: legitimacy, critical resources or networks. The high level of interaction between these three sources of power means that a shortage in one can easily produce shortages in the other two.The authors argue that, generally, executives who have a power deficit can solve the problem in one of two ways: they must either play the game more effectively or change the game by, for instance, reshaping their role in the organization. The authors offer examples and recommendations and provide a short questionnaire to help managers identify potential power deficits.The good news is that the odds of success are good. The authors report that in their coaching work with 179 executives who wrestled with power deficits, only four failed to improve the situation.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781422144060","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Sleeping with Your Smartphone","authors":["Leslie A.

In fact, she shows that you can devote more time to your personal life and accomplish more at work.The good news is that this doesn’t require a grand organizational makeover or buy-in from the CEO. All it takes is collaboration between you and your teamworking together and making small, doable changes.What started as an experiment with a six-person team at The Boston Consulting Groupone of the world’s elite management consulting firmstriggered a global initiative that eventually spanned more than nine hundred BCG teams in thirty countries across five continents.

Employees were more satisfied with their work-life balance and with their work in general. And the firm was better able to recruit and retain employees.

It's time for men—and for all of us—to stand up and say, ‘Give us back our full humanity, give us back our dignity.'”—Paul Gilbert, PhD, author of The Compassionate Mind In a recent FiveThirtyEight poll, 60 percent of men surveyed said society puts pressure on men to behave in a way that is unhealthy or bad. Men account for 80 percent of suicides in the United States, and three in ten American men have suffered from depression. Ed Adams and Ed Frauenheim say a big part of the problem is a model of masculinity that's become outmoded and even dangerous, to both men and women. The conventional notion of what it means to be a man—what Adams and Frauenheim call “Confined Masculinity”—traps men in an emotional straitjacket; steers them toward selfishness, misogyny, and violence; and severely limits their possibilities. As an antidote, they propose a new paradigm: Liberating Masculinity. It builds on traditional masculine roles like the protector and provider, expanding men's options to include caring, collaboration, emotional expressivity, an inclusive spirit, and environmental stewardship. Through hopeful stories of men who have freed themselves from the strictures of Confined Masculinity, interviews with both leaders and everyday men, and practical exercises, this book shows the power of a masculinity defined by what the authors call the five Cs: curiosity, courage, compassion, connection, and commitment. Men will discover a way of being that fosters healthy, harmonious relationships at home, at work, and in the world.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Culture in Business"]},{"id":"9781626561038","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"The Multicultural Mind","authors":["David Thomas"],"pages":"176","publication_date":"February 2016","description":"Globalization has created a superheated competitive business environment that demands innovation to stay ahead.

According to science-based marketing and business expert Roger Dooley, they illustrate the real and growing threat of “friction,” which he defines as the unnecessary expenditure of time, effort, or money in performing a task.\nIn today's high-speed, customer-empowered world, the levels of swiftness and efficiency of business transactions will determine ultimate success or failure. In this groundbreaking guide, Dooley helps you spot the inevitable points of friction in your organization, and he provides the tools and insight you need to eliminate them. By truly understanding the impact friction can have, you’ll be able to establish positive habits and eliminate negative ones—all with the end result of building a company that’s the envy of your industry. Friction takes you step-by-step through the process of:\n•Empowering frank conversations\n•Guiding individual and team behaviors\n•Getting ahead of friction\n•Optimizing the customer experience\n•Building a frictionless corporate culture\nCombining scientific research with real-life examples of leaders who have conquered business friction, Dooley teaches you how to identify roadblocks, alter them for the benefit of both business and customer, and create positive, lasting change.\nIf you’re in a leadership position, now is the time to declare war on friction—before your competitors do. Stamp out ridiculous rules, pointless procedures, and meaningless meetings. Become a relentless advocate for the customer and for minimizing customer effort. Lubricate every point of friction and make your company run like a well-oiled machine.\nFriction provides the know-how you need to lead your company to industry dominance.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9780131388444","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"A Century of Mistakes in Baseball","authors":["Martin B.

It’s infecting the very roots of business performance, and it’s spreading fast. It isn’t the recession, market volatility, scandal, or greed.\n\nIt’s entitlement. And it may be killing your business.\n\nIn myriad ways, entitlement has been cultivated for decades. As a result, too many employees today believe that they are entitled to a paycheck simply because they show up. Brad Hams has proven that we are not doomed to a path of entitlement and dependence. After more than 15 years working with hundreds of companies, he knows that the vast majority of employees addicted to entitlement actually want to engage, want to contribute, and feel much better about themselves when they are in an environment that requires them to do so.\n\nNow, with Ownership Thinking, Hams shares his strategy that will increase your company’s productivity, employee retention, and profitability:\n\nThe Right Education: Teach employees the fundamentals of business and finance, how their company makes money, and how they add—or take away—value.\nThe Right Measures: Identify the organization’s Key Performance Indicators and teach employees to forecast results in an environment of high visibility and accountability.\nThe Right Incentives: Create incentive plans that are self-funding and clearly align employees’ behavior to the organization’s business and financial objectives.\n\nYour employees will learn to think and act like owners and will become active participants in the financial performance of the business. They will gain the self-esteem that is only possible through achievement and will reap rewards that are in alignment with the success of their organization. Meanwhile, you will enjoy your role more, sleep better at night, and leave a legacy that is far more inspiring and significant than you dreamed possible.\n\nPraise for Ownership Thinking\n\n“You would have to read a dozen other books to even come close to Ownership Thinking—a systematic and practical process for getting your employees to give that extra effort and brain power we know they possess.”—Verne Harnish, CEO, Gazelles; author, Mastering the Rockefeller Habits\n\n“Brad Hams tells it like it truly is: transparency creates trust; trust creates engagement; engagement creates a healthy enterprise. This thoughtful and practical book shows you how to achieve all of these things and more.”—Chip Conley, founder and executive chair, Joie de Vivre; author, Peak\n\n“Comprehensive and marvelously clear, Ownership Thinking’s techniques for creating change are focused, direct, and motivating. This is a wise book, unusually useful, and I recommend it most highly.”—Judith M.

Too many companies are managed not by leaders but by mere role players and faceless bureaucrats. What would it take to replace these empty suits with real leaders--men and women who are confident in who they are and what they stand for and who truly inspire people to achieve extraordinary results? Rob Goffee and Gareth Jones argue that leaders don't become great by aspiring to a list of universal character traits. Rather, effective leaders are authentic: they deploy individual strengths to engage followers' hearts, minds, and souls. Authentic leaders are skillful at consistently being themselves, even as they alter their behavior to respond effectively to changing contexts. In short, the authors present a powerful case: that it takes \"being yourself, in context, with skill\" to be a successful, authentic leader--and they show you how to do exactly that. In this lively and practical book, Goffee and Jones draw from extensive research to reveal how to hone and deploy your unique leadership assets while managing the inherent tensions at the heart of successful leadership: when to show emotion and when to withhold it, how to get close to followers while maintaining an appropriate role distance, and maintaining your individuality while \"conforming enough\" to gain traction and lead change. Underscoring the inherently social nature of leadership, the book also explores how leaders can stay attuned to the needs and expectations of followers. Why Should Anyone Be Led by You? will forever change how we view, develop, and practice the art of leadership, wherever we live and work.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9780132905343","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"When Core Values Are Strategic: How the Basic Values of Procter & Gamble Transformed Leadership at Fortune 500 Companies","authors":["Rick Tocquigny","Andy Butcher"],"pages":"272","publication_date":"January 2012","description":"What do legendary leaders from Disney, GE, GM, Johnson & Johnson, Boeing, eBay, Microsoft, Time Warner, LensCrafters, Chiquita, Walmart, Pepsi, and Saatchi+Saatchi have in common?

From shaping problems in new ways and learning from failure through experimentation, to stimulating productive conflict and structuring coordinated conversations, you can escape these traps and discover the value hidden in your organizationwithout spending a dime.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management"]},{"id":"9780749482534","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Leadership Coaching","authors":["Graham Lee"],"pages":"184","publication_date":"October 2003","description":"Use psychological and practical coaching techniques to develop effective leaders","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Executive Coaching"]},{"id":"9781604913583","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Leadership in Action: Reader Forum - Leaders Can Learn Much from Gandhi","authors":["Ashok Nalamalapu"],"pages":"1","publication_date":"October 2004","description":"Leading by example—an example from which today's leaders in both the public and private sectors can learn much—Gandhi inspired millions of Indians to win independence through a nonviolent movement.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"53863MIT66310","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"How to Amplify the Advantages of Working at a Founder-Led Company","authors":["Jason Shen"],"pages":"7","publication_date":"December 2024","description":"Founders tend to have three unique advantages as leaders of their organizations: domain expertise, earned legitimacy, and, when things go wrong, more-forgiving stakeholders.

When Bachelder was named CEO of Popeyes in the fall of 2007, guest visits had been declining for years, restaurant sales and profit trends were negative, and the company stock price had dropped from $34 in 2002 to $13. The brand was stagnant, and relations between the company and its franchise owners were strained. By 2014, average restaurant sales were up 25 percent, and profits were up 40 percent. Popeyes' market share had grown from 14 percent to 21 percent, and the stock price was over $40. The franchisees were so pleased with the turnaround that they began reinvesting in the brand, rapidly remodeling restaurants, and building new units around the world. The difference maker, Bachelder says, was a conscious decision to lead in a new way. She and her team created a workplace where people were treated with respect and dignity yet challenged to perform at the highest level. Silos and self were set aside in favor of collaboration and team play. And the results were measured with rigor and discipline. Servant leadership is sometimes derided as soft or ineffective, but this book shows that it's actually challenging and tough minded—a daring path. Bachelder takes you firsthand through the transformation of Popeyes and shows how a leader at any level can become a Dare-to-Serve leader.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Culture in Business"]},{"id":"9781633691230","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"In Their Time","authors":["Anthony J.

At home, they often face an unequal division of household chores and childcare, and in the workplace, they deal with lower pay, lack of credit for their contributions, roadblocks to promotion, sexual harassment, and more. And while organizations are looking to address these issues, too many gender-inclusion initiatives focus on how women themselves should respond, reinforcing the perception that these are \"women's issues\" and that men—often the most influential stakeholders in an organization—don't need to be involved.\n\nGender-in-the-workplace experts David G. Smith and W. Brad Johnson counter this perception. In this important book, they show that men have a crucial role to play in promoting gender equality at work. Research shows that when men are deliberately engaged in gender-inclusion programs, 96 percent of women in those organizations perceive real progress in gender equality, compared with only 30 percent of women in organizations without strong male engagement.\n\nGood Guys is the first practical, research-based guide for how to be a male ally to women in the workplace. Filled with firsthand accounts from both men and women, and tips for getting started, the book shows how men can partner with their female colleagues to advance women's leadership and equality by breaking ingrained gender stereotypes, overcoming unconscious biases, developing and supporting the talented women around them, and creating productive and respectful working relationships with women.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Culture in Business"]},{"id":"9780132480703","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Dynamics of Indecision: A Failure of Leadership","authors":["Michael A.

Yet history proves that a new generation of success stories will likely emerge from this era of financial chaos. And this new book prepares you to be one of those success stories by analyzing the inner qualities that have propelled the forward-thinking leaders of our time: drive, determination, and self-awareness.\n\nAs strategists for the internationally renowned consumer and political research firm Penn, Schoen & Berland Associates, Michael Berland and Douglas Schoen are experts in how successful people think . . . and how they win. Now they share what they've learned with firsthand accounts from some of the world's most successful people in nearly every field—including the founder of Starwood Resorts; a world-famous chef-restaurateur; the CEO of NBC Universal; a supermodel turned entrepreneur; the head of Estée Lauder; the commissioner of the National Hockey League; the president of Hearst Magazines; and the creator of CBS's 60 Minutes.

In this unprecedented collection of stories from some of the most successful people in fashion, sports, entertainment, and business, Schoen and Berland demonstrate that success isn't about changing who you are; rather, it's about figuring out what makes you tick—and leveraging that knowledge to your advantage.

Take heed. Author and serial CEO Dick Cross pulls back the curtain on this top leadership role, explaining in his new book that being a successful leader, running a business, and doing it extraordinarily well isn’t a full-time job. How do you successfully lead and run a business? The answer may surprise you. Cross suggests that the most important, and often overlooked, duty for a CEO is thinking about how to improve his or her business and how to be a leader. In 60-Minute CEO, Cross explains that the essential elements of the CEO role can be accomplished in several 60-minute sessions every week. Executives may fill their time with other tasks, but leading and running a company requires explicit skills different from those needed for any other corporate position. The good news is that those skills are easy to learn, fun to do, and not time-consuming. In an entertaining style, Cross offers executives the fast track to the top leadership position, focusing on two aspects: thinking and character. And while 60 minutes may seem like a quick fix, as Cross sees it, three 60-minute sessions a week devoted solely to considering your business and your role as leader are crucial to business and leadership success—and the payoff is proven. In 60-Minute CEO, Dick Cross brings over 25 years of experience of transforming companies in various stages of underperformance into industry powerhouses. Cross combines his knowledge and experience with the stories and lessons of preeminent leaders and thinkers including General George Patton and Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781119147497","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Accelerating Performance","authors":["Colin Price","Sharon Toye"],"pages":"352","publication_date":"January 2017","description":"Transform your organization into a dynamic catalyst for success\n\nAccelerating Performance is not just another “warm and fuzzy” change management book—it's a practical, comprehensive, data-driven action plan for picking up the pace and achieving more.

Washington asks company leaders, and often she hears about an ideal vision of an organization that values diversity and inclusion and wants employees to bring their whole selves to work.\n\nBut how can you get there? Organizations have largely missed the mark when it comes to creating environments where all employees thrive in an equal and equitable way, because they treat diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) as a program that gets done rather than the necessary and difficult journey it is. A truly inclusive workplace requires invention and reinvention, mistakes and humility, adaptation to a changing world, constant reflection, and sometimes significant sacrifice.\n\nThe road to an inclusive workplace is a difficult one, but you can traverse it, and there's help along the way. Start here with stories of companies making the necessary journey, including Slack, PwC, Best Buy, Denny's, and many others. Hear from company leaders about their successes and failures, the times they were on the vanguard, and the moments they realized they had much more work to do. These are profiles in perseverance from people who are keen enough to recognize the need for inclusive workplaces and humble enough to know they're not there yet. Along the way, Washington provides a framework for thinking about where these companies are on their journeys and where you and your company may be too.\n\nProgress is hard won on the necessary journey to becoming an inclusive organization, but it must be won.

Katzenbach","James Thomas","Gretchen Anderson"],"pages":"208","publication_date":"January 2019","description":"In a global survey by the Katzenbach Center, 80 percent of respondents believed that their organization must evolve to succeed. But a full quarter of them reported that a change effort at their organization had resulted in no visible results. Why? The fate of any change effort depends on whether and how leaders engage their culture: the self-sustaining patterns of behaving, feeling, thinking, and believing that determine how things are done in an organization. Culture is implicit rather than explicit, emotional rather than rational--that's what makes it so hard to work with, but that's also what makes it so powerful. For the first time, this book lays out the Katzenbach Center's proven methodology for identifying your culture's four most critical elements: traits, characteristics that are at the heart of people's emotional connection to what they do; keystone behaviors, actions that would lead your company to succeed if they were replicated at a greater scale; authentic informal leaders, people who have a high degree of \"emotional intuition\" or social connectedness; and metrics, integrated, thoughtful measures to track progress, encourage the self-reinforcing cycle of lasting change and link to business performance. By leveraging these critical few elements, you can tap into a source of catalytic change within your organization. People will make an emotional, not just a rational, commitment to new initiatives. You will elicit enthusiasm and creativity and build the kind of powerful company that people recognize for its innate value and effectiveness.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Culture in Business"]},{"id":"9780273724605","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"The Coaching Secret","authors":["Dr. Andrew Machon"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"September 2013","description":"Coaching as a field has mushroomed in recent years.

These perplexing, recurring issues are familiar to anyone in a leadership role today, including:\n\nHow do I balance my functional or business unit goals with the needs of my peers and the whole company?\n\nHow do I support and promote others while still advancing my own career?\n\nHow do I emphasize teamwork and still reward the \"stars\"?\n\nCan I really devote enough time and energy to both family and work?\n\nThese are not \"problems\" but paradoxes—situations in which there will never be a single correct solution—and while they make many leaders feel overwhelmed and challenged, this remarkable book provides help. The Unfinished Leader is a modern handbook for recognizing, facing, and inspiring others to expose the real issues that underlie paradoxes in modern organizations. Leaders must first recognize situations they will never be able to \"solve\" and understand how to confront the barriers—in their own heads and their organizations—that push them towards seeking ultimate solutions that don't exist. Leading through complexity requires giving up the illusion of control, consistency, and closure, while embracing the reality of being permanently \"unfinished.\"\n\nDrawing from interviews with 100 CEOs and top leaders from a wide range of companies—such as Avon, Nike, Colgate, DeutschePost DHL, Johnson &amp; Johnson, PepsiCo, and many more—The Unfinished Leader provides the mindsets and tools to recognize contradictory requirements, understand competing demands, and still be able to take action. No one can find or even should look for perfect solutions to impossible situations. The Unfinished Leader will help leaders at all levels understand and excel at their true task: guiding themselves and their teams through ongoing paradoxes, reconciling competing outcomes, continually changing and adapting, and thereby building lasting success.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781118004357","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"TouchPoints: Creating Powerful Leadership Connections in the Smallest of Moments","authors":["Mette Norgaard","Douglas R.

The alternative is to become good at developing your talented managers into great leaders and aggressively seeking out potential and developing it anywhere and everywhere you can find it across the organization.

Used by over eight hundred organizations across the globe, the strategic fitness process has helped leaders in a diverse range of industries--including medical technology, information technology, banking, restaurant chains, and pharmaceuticals--hear the raw but necessary truth about the sources of misalignment between their strategies and their organizations.\n\nIn addition to step-by-step instructions, Beer offers detailed and illustrative case studies of companies that have conducted honest conversations to great effect.

They make things too complex. They clutter it with jargon and confusion. They pancake new initiatives on top of old ones. They dither on the launch pad. They chase too many fads. And they fail to make it “safe” for leaders to lead the transformation at their own level. In short, they don’t have a reliable corporate transformation game plan.\n\nWhatever your corporate transformation challenge, whatever your role, Robert H. Miles and Michael T. Kanazawa introduce a simple, proven, results-driven approach that has underpinned some of the most successful corporate transformations of our time. Drawing on their experience as principal process architects working with dozens of CEOs and executive teams, and hundreds of senior executives and staff professionals, they show you how to develop a compelling and potent corporate transformation game plan that enables you to align your organization behind just a few core initiatives; bias your people toward speed; create leaders at every level; integrate in new “disruptive” tools to accelerate progress; and achieve traction and accountability in all phases of execution.\n\nWhether you’re a new CEO taking charge to transform your company, an executive redirecting a major business or function, or one of the hundreds of managers and thousands of employees trying to make sense of a transformation and contribute to it, this book will help you decipher the complexity, find your place on the transformation roadmap, and ensure that the effort rapidly reaches its intended breakthrough results.\n\nA PROVEN, STEP-BY-STEP ROADMAP FOR TRANSFORMATION LEADERS – FAST, SIMPLE, AND COMPRESSED\n\nCorporate transformation and breakthrough performance without the confusion and complexity\n\nGEARED TO RAPIDLY ENGAGE THE FULL ORGANIZATION\n\nTo equip leaders at all levels to lead your transformation in an aligned and engaging manner\n\nFOCUSES EVERYONE ON “DOING MORE ONLESS”\n\nGenerates focused execution and avoid layering initiative upon initiative to conquer organizational gridlock\n\nDESIGNED TO “DISRUPT” HOW TRADITIONAL TRANSFORMATION PROGRAMS ARE DONE\n\nIntroduces disruptive transformation competencies that drive innovation, growth, and a new way of activating change\n\nCorporate transformation is tough work, but extraordinarily rewarding for all involved when led successfully. Somebody’s got to do it, and do it well. What if that someone happens to be you? Where will you start? How will you frame your transformation game plan and lay out its roadmap? What will you do first, and who will you engage when in the enterprise? How will you keep it alive after the early excitement? And how will you make it part of your management process so that it can become a reliable core competency for rising to the increasing rate of disruptive transformation challenges facing your company?\n\nNow there’s a breakthrough methodology to enable CEOs and executive leaders to rise to these corporate transformation challenges.\n\nIn this new edition of BIG Ideas to BIG Results, Robert H.

The troubles simmered below the CEO’s radar, and by the time the problems were revealed, most of the damage had been done. As organizations and business environments become more complex, how are executives supposed to keep tabs on what competitors and employees are doing? Although many management experts have assumed that better information systems and more data are the most promising way forward, authors Davide Nicolini, Maja Korica and Keith Ruddle are skeptical. Rather, they say, the way for senior executives to “stay in the know” is by assembling and maintaining what they call a “personal knowledge infrastructure.” And while information technologies may be part of this personal knowledge infrastructure, the authors say technology is just one of the components. The article is based on a two-year study of the day-to-day work of seven CEOs of some of the largest and most challenging hospital- and mental health-based organizations in England. As settings for studying the challenges of using information and knowledge to stay on top, the authors note, health-care organizations sit at the crossroads between the private and public sectors and are expected to meet multiple, often competing, demands. The authors sought to answer a simple question: How did the CEOs know what they needed to know in order to be effective at their jobs? While the importance of informational roles to executives is well established, the authors take the idea a step further, arguing that managers — and especially senior executives — are only as good at acquiring and interpreting critical information as their personal knowledge infrastructures. At times, the authors argue, simple things such as talking to customers or networking with board members are more important than using sophisticated new tools, provided they are done methodically and with some purpose. Selecting when particular elements of a personal knowledge infrastructure are appropriate depends on the circumstances. Understanding and, when needed, overhauling one’s personal knowledge infrastructure should be routine for executives. The article examines how this can be done.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management"]},{"id":"9781119232575","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Leaders and Innovators","authors":["Tho H.

Accountability tells the story of Pete Williams, a hard-charging CEO, who meets Stan \"Kip\" Kiplinger, a retired businessman, during a cross-country train trip. Pete's manufacturing business is in critical condition; productivity is falling. He's tried all the popular management approaches, but he can't get his people to be accountable for meeting their goals.Kip points out that every management system Pete has used is ultimately based on controlling people. Rather than encouraging people to be accountable, control-based systems discourage accountability by destroying people's sense of ownership of their job. Kip introduces Pete to a new way of leading people based on freedom-giving people the freedom to make their own choices and to do it their way. This doesn't mean anarchy; it means leadership expects everyone to act like an adult and take responsibility for his or her actions and their outcomes. Accountability details how this new approach yields a consistent flow of creative innovations and organizational improvements impossible under the old, coercive systems.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management"]},{"id":"9781562867195","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Coaching Up and Down the Generations","authors":["Lisa Haneberg"],"pages":"224","publication_date":"December 2010","description":"Presents the fundamentals of coaching, including topics such as push versus pull coaching, acting as a catalyst, learning how to listen, and providing accountability and structure in a fun and breezy style.

But why do people follow? Books abound on leaders, but much less is known about followers. In The Leaders We Need, Maccoby steps into this yawning gap in the literature.This insightful book shows that followers have their own powerful motivations to follow. Many relate to their leader as to some important person from the pasta parent, a sibling, a close friend. With major shifts in family structure and other social changes (especially transformations in technology and work life), these transferences” have grown complexmaking leaders’ work more challenging.The key for modern-day leaders? Being sensitive to how a group’s collective psychology and social context shape its leadership needs. For example, factory workers in a large city during a period of relative calm would need very different leaders than people working in a star management consultancy during a time of stiffening competition. The author outlines the profound shift from a more bureaucratic society and leadership model to an interactive, collaborative oneand provides crucial advice on how to become a leader we need.”Offering provocative psychological insight and thoughtful analysis of social and cultural changes, this book examines leadership through an entirely new lens.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781604911718","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Influence for Nonprofit Leaders","authors":["Deborah Friedman"],"pages":"30","publication_date":"August 2013","description":"Influence is an essential component of leadership, especially in a nonprofit environment.

Harrison led an ambitious transformation that has unleashed Intermountain’s workforce not only to improve the organization but to look beyond it and tackle a range of problems that have plagued both the industry and our broader society. Bucking the prevailing culture of conflict and polarization, leaders at all levels are empowered to convene diverse stakeholders in unorthodox ways to solve problems that affect everyone.\n\nIn Possibility Unleashed, you’ll learn what happens when you:\n\nWalk in others’ shoes\nEmbrace an outsider’s perspective\nLook in the mirror\nFix what isn’t broken . . . yet\nUnlock the genius at the bedside (or at the front line)\nAsk “What if?”\nMake “frenemies”\nGo upstream\nStand up for what’s right\nColor outside the (red and blue) lines\n\nYou’ll find real-life examples of how this works in action—from a liberal, Harvard-trained program manager partnering with a leading gun rights advocate to address the issue of firearm-assisted suicides to a healthcare organization fighting high prices and drug shortages by working with its competitors to establish a not-for-profit generic drug company that benefits all. And while other health systems stand by as their communities struggle with poverty, crime, and other seemingly nonmedical issues, Intermountain is investing millions to address them, recognizing that they in turn profoundly affect people’s health. It’s a radical approach to leadership that shuns the status quo to create lasting transformative change. In Possibility Unleashed, you’ll discover the blueprint to making a far greater impact on society than you’d imagined while also building strong, financially healthy organizations where people love to work.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"01520110054SI","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Leading Roles: What Coaches of Women Need to Know","authors":["Marian N.

The process as it unfolds is complex, paradoxical and counterintuitive -but well worth the effort.The new introduction dispels the notion that empowerment is a bygone fad. No matter what its name, the essential concept-that organizations can achieve extraordinary results by recognizing and taking advantage of the skills, experience, and knowledge already existing in the organization-will always be relevant.The new epilogue describes obstacles companies have encountered and overcome and outlines empowerment strategies that have proved successful during the fifteen years the authors have been consulting, researching, and refining these concepts.Although sometimes arduous, the journey to empowerment is well worth making.

We need look no further than events on the world stage to see the heat signature of this – from the arrival of Wikileaks, the Arab Spring of 2011 and the Occupy movements, to the social media revolution and flashpoints such as the British Members of Parliament expenses scandal. All are examples of deep change occurring.\n\nThis book is about what this means for the workplace and for management. The proposition offered here is that our organisations need to catch up, and that the \"death of deference\" that we are seeing elsewhere in society needs to be accelerated in the workplace.\n\nSystems of deference slow down organisational performance. Deference prevents organisations from learning. It stops them from being agile, innovative and ethical. Deference is the enemy of organisational success and it needs to be dismantled so that in its place we can build modern organisations with a new breed of managers and leaders. This book offers a solution to a problem that belongs in the last century, and a game plan for nothing short of a workplace revolution.\n\n\"If deference is dead, this book is about the resurrection of the effective manager in a world where nothing is quite the way it used to be. Powerful and thought-provoking from start to finish.\"\n\n- Jeremy Vine, BBC Presenter and Author\n\n\"Never Mind the Bosses is a refreshing type of management book, it advocates that deference to authority figures needs to go if we are to have engaged workforces.\"\n\n- Cary L.

In a word: heroes. Although such figures are inspiring, their larger-than-life accomplishments are not what makes the world work. Instead, it is the sum of millions of small yet consequential decisions that individuals working far from the limelight make every day. \nBadaracco calls these individuals \"quiet leaders\"-  people who choose responsible, behind-the-scenes action over public heroism to resolve tough leadership challenges. Quiet leaders don't fit the stereotype of the bold and gutsy leader, and they don't want to. What they want is to do the \"right thing\"- for their organizations, their coworkers, and themselves- inconspicuously and without casualties. \nDrawing from extensive research, Harvard Business School professor and author Joseph Badaracco presents eight practical yet counter-intuitive guidelines for situations in which right and wrong seem like moving targets. Compelling stories illustrate how these \"nonheroes\" succeed by managing their political capital, buying themselves time, bending the rules, and more.

NEW PREFACE","authors":["Rob Goffee","Gareth Jones"],"pages":"256","publication_date":"November 2015","description":"Are you an authentic leader? Too many companies are managed not by leaders but by mere role players and faceless bureaucrats. What would it take to replace these empty suits with real leaders--men and women who are confident in who they are and what they stand for and who truly inspire people to achieve extraordinary results? Rob Goffee and Gareth Jones argue that leaders don’t become great by aspiring to a list of universal character traits. Rather, effective leaders are authentic: they deploy individual strengths to engage followers’ hearts, minds, and souls. Authentic leaders are skillful at consistently being themselves, even as they alter their behavior to respond effectively to changing contexts. In short, the authors present a powerful case: that it takes “being yourself, in context, with skill” to be a successful, authentic leader--and they show you how to do exactly that. In this lively and practical book, Goffee and Jones draw from extensive research to reveal how to hone and deploy your unique leadership assets while managing the inherent tensions at the heart of successful leadership: when to show emotion and when to withhold it, how to get close to followers while maintaining an appropriate role distance, and maintaining your individuality while “conforming enough” to gain traction and lead change. Underscoring the inherently social nature of leadership, the book also explores how leaders can stay attuned to the needs and expectations of followers. \"Why Should Anyone Be Led by You?\" will forever change how we view, develop, and practice the art of leadership, wherever we live and work.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9780132312516","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Making Work Fun Really Works","authors":["James F.

Yet, over the past several years, a growing number of CEOs have failed early in their terms, often with devastating consequences to their companies and stockholders. By far the most common problem is a lack of ownership of the CEO succession process. Inside CEO Succession provides businesses, leaders, and boards with the strategies they need to execute their responsibilities with a heightened level of professionalism and ensure the sustained success of the companies they serve.\n\nWritten by Dr. Thomas J. Saporito, CEO of RHR International, and Dr. Paul Winum, Senior Partner of RHR International, the lessons of Inside CEO Succession are rooted in RHR's long-standing history of bringing expert knowledge, experience, advice, and counsel to the issues related to CEO succession. The culmination of RHR's 65 years of experience providing expert counsel to the boards of directors of hundreds of companies, it explains how ego, role-relationships, power, and human dynamics associated with relinquishing leadership, preparing successors, and ceding power and authority to other people create undetected problems in the succession process and ultimately cause many CEOs to fail early in their tenures.\n\nDistills RHR's 65 years of experience helping businesses deal with CEO succession into one practical resource\n\nPresents strategies to enable boards to understand their role in succession planning and how to source leadership that best fits their organization's culture and requirements\n\nBrings together business acumen and psychological insight to help readers better prepare for more effective CEO succession\n\nTo be successful, CEO succession requires a well-defined course of action that ensures that a number of highly capable candidates are ready to assume the chief executive position whether through an unexpected event or a planned transition.

Ironically, companies often expend significant resources on external advice while employees with the best strategy ideas are ignored and thus may walk out the door.\n\nExamples illustrate that the mobility of employees -- whether they are fired or leave of their own volition -- can be seen as a leading indicator of the future prospects of a company.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Strategic Thinking"]},{"id":"9781604914931","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Leadership in Action: Change and leadership Development: The Experience of Executive Women","authors":["Patricia J.

The CEO and executive team are almost always highly compensated and the relative total compensation has mushroomed over time. Most of the compensation now is designed to be performance-based, but leading to charges that executives have incentives to manipulate corporate earnings and stock price in the short-term for their own self interests. The compensation at some companies became so egregious that compensation again became a major public policy issue subject to federal regulation. Executive Compensation focuses on the major topics related to executive compensation—present, past, and future. First, is understanding what executive compensation is, including composition and objectives of pay contracts. Second, how do specific compensation agreements affect corporate behavior and performance? Third, what are the major components, including how and what are accounted for and disclosed? How is compensation, especially executive compensation, accounted for—that is, what are the calculations and journal entries required? Fourth, what does historical analysis tell us about the topic, especially how contractual decisions have been made and what has worked.

In fact, recognizing difference as a positive force can bring astonishing value to even the most diverse organizations.In Us Plus Them, leadership scholar Todd Pittinsky introduces a groundbreaking new science of diversity that: Debunks the assumption that wherever there is difference there will be inherent tension and animosity Challenges the effectiveness of our standard attempts to fight prejudice and combat hate in our schools and workplaces, our civic and religious lives Reveals how we benefit from the mixing of different ethnic, racial, national, social, and religious groups in a globalized worldThrough a wide range of examplesfrom Maine and Michigan to Rwanda and Bhutan, and from small-town classrooms to corporate boardroomsPittinsky opens our eyes to misunderstood yet useful aspects of us-and-them relations, including many of the neglected positive dimensions of difference. He provides a bold new assessment of the popular and scientific approaches to the issue, proving that it’s time to move beyond mere tolerance to build communities in which the two sides of the us-and-them equation engage each other because they both want to.Much as Martin Seligman and positive psychology have shifted the focus from mental illness to mental healthiness, this book shifts our mind-set to diversity as a positive force. Understanding the science and practical use of that energy will help us build the schools, neighborhoods, companies, and nations we want, and not simply avoid the ugliest problems of the past.

Brace yourself: You may be at faultby unknowingly triggering the set-up-to-fail syndrome. Perhaps things started off swimmingly. But then something--a missed deadline, a lost clientmade you question the person's performance. You began micromanaging him. Suspecting your reduced confidence, he started doubting himselfand stopped giving his best. You viewed his new behavior as additional proof of mediocrity, and tightened the screws further. In The Set-Up-to-Fail Syndrome, Jean-Francois Manzoni and Jean-Louis Barsoux show how this insidious cycle hurts everyone: employees stop volunteering ideas, preventing your organization from getting the most from them; you lose energy to attend to other activities; and your reputation suffers as other employees deem you unfair. Team spirit wilts as targeted performers are alienated. But the set-up-to-fail syndrome doesn't have to happen. The authors provide preventive measures, such as loosening the reins as new employees master their jobs. If the syndrome has already erupted, Manzoni and Barsoux explain how to discuss the dynamic with your employee and reverse the cycle.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management"]},{"id":"9783110799194","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Leadership in a Post-COVID Pandemic World","authors":["David McGuire","Marie-Line Germain"],"pages":"170","publication_date":"October 2023","description":"The COVID-19 pandemic has placed extraordinary demands on leaders compelled to navigate a complex, far-reaching event that threatened human life, business continuity and survival.

Ready","Alan Mulally"],"pages":"9","publication_date":"October 2017","description":"The authors argue that it is increasingly important for business leaders to learn how to build companies that are simultaneously purpose-driven, performance-focused, and principles-led. At a time when the pace of change in business is faster than ever, they believe that building organizations with these three characteristics is no longer a choice. Being performance-driven is clearly essential to success; continuous disruption, rapid technological innovation, and turbulence require that today’s leaders build agile organizations with resilient employees in order to achieve superior performance. But focusing on results alone is not enough. Demographic, cultural, and technological changes have led to a workforce that demands a set of operating principles characterized by core values such as transparency, trust, inclusion, and real-time collaboration to help guide behaviors and decision-making in companies. Finally, studies have shown that millennials are deeply motivated by corporate social responsibility and a compelling sense of purpose. Together, these forces make the case that companies that fail to aspire to align purpose, performance, and principles will also fail to attract the best talent. Furthermore, to achieve the kind of transformations that today’s fast-moving economy often requires of businesses, executives need engaged, committed employees who have opportunities to contribute their knowledge. Purpose and principles can help engage employees in support of high performance. The authors acknowledge that while it is easy for executives to say they aspire to build companies that are simultaneously purpose-driven, performance-focused, and principles-led, it is a difficult accomplishment to achieve. There are often inherent tensions and conflicting goals associated with trying to achieve all three aims. How can executives align purpose, performance, and principles so that they can lead their organizations through major changes? The authors’ research and experience suggest the task requires not only a set of leadership skills that they describe but also five mindsets that encompass the embedded tensions that face leaders of large, complex organizations. Executives must learn to reconcile these tensions by mastering a series of five conflicting yet complementary dualities: urgency and patience; collective and individual accountability; coaching and driving performance; student and teacher; and humility and boldness. One of the authors, Alan Mulally, the former CEO of Ford Motor Co., describes the role these dualities played when he led a successful turnaround of that company.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9780787960759","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Five Dysfunctions of a Team: A Leadership Fable","authors":["Patrick M.

Will she succeed? Will she be fired? Will the company fail? Lencioni's utterly gripping tale serves as a timeless reminder that leadership requires as much courage as it does insight.\n\nThroughout the story, Lencioni reveals the five dysfunctions which go to the very heart of why teams even the best ones-often struggle.

Then I was passed over for a promotion and my manager couldn’t give me feedback on what areas to improve, so I could get to the senior engineer level. I was frustrated; even bitter: not as much about missing the promotion, but because of the lack of guidance.\n\nBy the time I became a manager, I was determined to support engineers reporting to me with the kind of feedback and support I wish I would have gotten years earlier. And I did. While my team tripled over the next two years, people became visibly better engineers, and this progression was clear from performance reviews and promotions.\n\nThis book is a summary of the advice I’ve given to software engineers over the years – and then some more.\n\nThis book follows the structure of a “typical” career path for a software engineer, from starting out as a fresh-faced software developer, through being a role model senior/lead, all the way to the staff/principle/distinguished level. It summarizes what I’ve learned as a developer and how I’ve approached coaching engineers at different stages of their careers.\n\nWe cover “soft” skills which become increasingly important as your seniority increases, and the “hard” parts of the job, like software engineering concepts and approaches which help you grow professionally.\n\nThe names of levels and their expectations can – and do! – vary across companies. The higher “tier” a business is, the more tends to be expected of engineers, compared to lower tier places. For example, the “senior engineer” level has notoriously high expectations at Google (L5 level) and Meta (E5 level,) compared to lower-tier companies. If you work at a higher-tier business, it may be useful to read the chapters about higher levels, and not only the level you’re currently interested in.\n\nThe book is composed of six standalone parts, each made up of several chapters:\n\nPart 1: Developer Career FundamentalsPart 2: The Competent Software DeveloperPart 3: The Well-Rounded Senior EngineerPart 4: The Pragmatic Tech LeadPart 5: Role Model Staff and Principal EngineersPart 6: Conclusion\n\nParts 1 and 6 apply to all engineering levels, from entry-level software developer, to principal-and-above engineer. Parts 2, 3, 4, and 5 cover increasingly senior engineering levels and group together topics in chapters, such as “Software Engineering,” “Collaboration,” “Getting Things Done,” etc.\n\nNaming and levels vary, but the principles of what makes a great engineer who is impactful at the individual, team, and organizational levels, are remarkably constant.

Using a multidisciplinary approach to management, this deceptively simple model offers a powerful set of tools for navigating complexity and turbulence; as the political and economic climate continues to evolve, this model has never been more relevant than today. \n\nThe Structural Frame explores the convergence of organizational structure and function, and shows why social architecture must take environment into account. Case studies illustrate successful alignment in diverse organizations, and guidelines provide strategic insight for avoiding common pathologies and achieving the right fit.\n\nThe Human Resource Frame dissects the complex dynamics at the intersection of people and organizations and charts the leadership and human resource practices that build motivation and high performance. \n\nThe Political Frame shows how competition, conflict, and the struggle for power and resources can be either a tool for growth or a toxic landmine for an individual or organization. Case studies show how both constructive and destructive practices influence social, political, and economic trends both within and beyond organizational boundaries.\n\nThe Symbolic Frame defines organizational culture, and delves into the emotional and existential underbelly of social life. It underscores the power of symbolic forms such as heroes, myths, and rituals in providing the glue that bonds social collectives together. \n\nThe Seventh Edition has been updated with new information on cross-sector collaboration, generational differences, virtual environments, globalization, cross-cultural communication, and more, with an expanded Instructor’s Guide that includes summaries, mini-assessments, videos, and extra resources.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781457191435","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Accelerate","authors":["Nicole Forsgren","Jez Humble","Gene Kim"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"March 2018","description":"\"Does technology actually matter?

The book continues to speak to people in a support function inside organizations as well as to external consultants.\n\nThis thoroughly revised and updated third edition of Peter Block's groundbreaking book explores the latest thinking on consultation. It includes new insights about how we can organize our consulting around discovering the strengths, positive examples, and gifts of the client organization or community. The book remains a practical and specific guide for anyone who needs to develop a capacity for deeper relatedness and partnership — which means it is for all who wish to make a real difference in the world.\n\nThis new edition covers the consulting challenges that have arisen from the way we routinely communicate electronically and live in the virtual world. Block suggests ways to overcome the distancing and isolating effects inherent in electronic connects. The book also includes practical guidance on how to ask better questions, gives suggestions for dealing with difficult clients, and contains expanded guidelines on more engaging forms of implementation.\n\nFlawless Consulting includes two new examples, taken from health care and educational reform efforts, to show how consulting skills can be useful (and often transformative) in a broader context. These illustrative examples point the way for achieving changes for leadership in business, government, religion, human services, and more.\n\nLike the first two editions, Flawless Consulting affirms the notion that authentic behavior and personal relationships are the key to technical and business success. By demonstrating their ability to be truly authentic at each step in the process, consultants can aim toward creating workplaces that are more collaborative and ultimately more successful.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Consulting"]},{"id":"9781118968178","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Leading with Strategic Thinking: Four Ways Effective Leaders Gain Insight, Drive Change, and Get Results","authors":["B.

When this doesn't happen and it becomes emotionally expensive to say what you truly think and feel, that lack of psychological safety triggers the self-censoring instinct, shuts down learning, and blocks collaboration and creativity. Timothy R. Clark, a former CEO, Oxford-trained social scientist, and organizational consultant, provides a research-based framework to help leaders transform their organizations into sanctuaries of inclusion and incubators of innovation.When leaders cultivate psychological safety, teams and organizations progress through four successive stages. First, people feel included and accepted; then they feel safe to learn, contribute, and finally, challenge the status quo. Clark draws deeply on psychology, philosophy, social science, literature, and his own experiences to show how leaders can, and must, set the tone and model the ideal behaviors—as he says, “you either show the way or get in the way.” This thoughtful and pragmatic guide demonstrates that if you banish fear, install true performance-based accountability, and create a nurturing environment that allows people to be vulnerable as they learn and grow, they will perform beyond your expectations.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management"]},{"id":"9781394364688","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Strategic Creativity","authors":["Simon Grand","Christoph Weckerle"],"pages":"224","publication_date":"October 2025","description":"A visionary guide for organizations to harmonize the deep interplay between strategy and creativity\n\nStrategic Creativity is the first book to address creativity from a strategic perspective.

Conventional approaches to strategy development and problem solving no longer work—there is no stable industry or market equilibrium structure that we will return to “when change abates.” Most company planning processes are fantasy; market conditions are changing too quickly for arm-chair strategizing to be useful. As a consequence, many management teams are stuck in a wait-and-see posture in response to extreme uncertainty in the post-Covid environment, while others are making panicky bets, including ‘leap before you look’ acquisitions.\n\nIn this sequel to their Amazon-bestseller, Bulletproof Problem Solving, Conn and McLean introduce a novel approach to strategic problem solving. Based on a decade of research and 30 new case studies, The Imperfectionists posits a dynamic approach to developing organizational direction under uncertainty based on harnessing six reinforcing strategic mindsets, which they call curiosity, dragonfly eye, occurrent behaviour, collective wisdom, imperfectionism, and show and tell.\n\nImperfectionists are curious, they look at problems from several perspectives, and gather new data and approaches, including from outside their current industry. They deliberately step into risk, proceeding through trial and error, utilizing nimble low consequence and reversible moves to deepen their understanding of the unfolding game being played, and to build capabilities. They accept ambiguity and some apparent failures in exchange for improved learning and market position. Imperfectionists succeed with dynamic, real time strategic problem solving, confidently moving forward while others wait for certainty, or make impetuous and foolish bets.\n\nThese strategic mindsets for solving tough problems in uncertain times help you fight decision biases and give you the data to develop informed strategies to win.

Toyota makes enormous investments in carefully selecting and intensively developing leaders who fit its unique philosophy and culture. Thanks to the company’s lean leadership approach, explains Toyota Way author Jeffrey Liker and former Toyota executive Gary Convis, the celebrated carmaker has set into motion a drive for continuous improvement at all levels of its business. This has allowed for:\n\nConstant growth: Toyota increased profitability for 58 consecutive years—slowing down only in the face of 2008’s worldwide financial difficulties, the recall crisis, and the worst Japanese earthquake of the century.\nUnstoppable inventiveness: Toyota’s approach to innovative thinking and problem solving has resulted in top industry ratings and incredible customer satisfaction, while allowing the company to weather these three crises in rapid succession and to come out stronger.\nStrong branding and respect: Toyota’s reputation was instrumental in the company’s ability to withstand the recalls-driven media storm of 2010.\n\nBut what looked to some to be a sinking ship is once again running under a full head of steam. Perhaps the Toyota culture had weakened, but lean leadership was the beacon that showed the way back.\n\nIn fact, writes Liker, the company is “as good and perhaps a better model for lean leadership than it ever has been.” of innovation and growth. Yet, Industry Week reports that just 2 percent of companies using lean processes can likewise claim to have had long-term success. What the other 98 percent lack is unified leadership with a common method and philosophy.\n\nIf you want to get lean, you have to take it to the leadership level.

Drawing on the same pioneering research that formed the foundation of their classic bestseller The Leadership Challenge (over 2.7 million copies sold), James Kouzes and Barry Posner offer a set of leadership skills and practices that will make a significant difference in every area of higher education—faculty, administration, library services, career counseling, auxiliary services, campus safety, and more. It's about the behaviors that leaders, regardless of their position, use to transform values into actions, visions into realities, obstacles into innovations, segments into solidarity, and risks into rewards. Kouzes and Posner tell the leadership story from the inside and move outward, describing it first as a personal journey and then as mobilizing others to want to do things they have never done before. The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership is the operating system for this adventure. Leadership in Higher Education explains the fundamental principles that support these practices and provides case examples of people in higher education who demonstrate each one. A core theme that weaves its way through all the chapters is that, whether it's one to one or one to many, leadership is a relationship between those who aspire to lead and those who choose to follow. We need leaders who can unite us and ignite us.

Foss"],"pages":"8","publication_date":"October 2014","description":"The Industrial Revolution brought the decline of small-scale, cottage production and the rise of large, integrated businesses; Adam Smith’s invisible hand was replaced with what business historian Alfred D. Chandler Jr., called the “visible hand” of management. But now that pendulum appears to be swinging the other way — to a system of loose networks, virtual businesses and peer-to-peer interactions. A supposed hallmark of the new economy has been the decline of managerial authority. Management gurus, consultants and pundits have proclaimed that hierarchy is out. Modern organizations such as online retailer Zappos have come to favor flat hierarchies with widely distributed authority. And yet, given the demands of the current environment, authors Nicholai J. Foss and Peter G. Klein argue that managerial authority is still essential in situations where (1) decisions are time-sensitive; (2) key knowledge is concentrated within the management team; and (3) there is need for internal coordination. Such conditions, they observe, are also hallmarks of our networked, knowledge-intensive andhypercompetitive economy.While it is true that many knowledge workers no longer need a boss to direct them to tasks or monitor their day-to-day progress, the authors contend that the role of managers and the definition of “authority” needs to change. Managers need to move away from specifying methods and processes in favor of defining the principles they want people to apply or the goals they want people to meet. In other words, the main task for top management is to define and implement the organizational rules of the game.To be sure, procedures for defining rules and frameworks can themselves be delegated and nested. Indeed, when a company’s key assets are knowledge workers whose skills and behaviors are difficult to assess objectively, companies will need to increasingly rely on more subjective assessments of performance, which must be carried out by managers.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management"]},{"id":"9781626562943","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Your Leadership Story","authors":["Tim Tobin"],"pages":"168","publication_date":"March 2015","description":"Stories have power. They move people in a way that facts and figures can't. Many leaders use stories as a tool, but leadership development expert Tim Tobin says most have no idea what tale their own leadership is telling. He shows how, by thinking of your career as a narrative—with a plot, characters, and an arc—you can increase your awareness of yourself as a leader and become more effective, insightful, and inspiring. Using story as both a metaphor and a process for self-development, Tobin offers activities and questions that help you better understand your own leadership and how others perceive it. What is the plot of your leadership story—your overall goals and purpose? Who are the main characters and what roles do they play? How have the settings of your story influenced it? What are the conflicts that you need to resolve to move toward the ending you intend? But you have to share your story to make it an effective leadership tool. Tobin gives detailed advice on framing your message, finding ways to communicate it, and understanding the role others play in furthering that message. If you don't tell your leadership story, other people will—and it may not be the story you want told. Taking control of your leadership story enables you to more consciously shape the impact you have in the world. You'll be better equipped to make decisions, choose actions that tell the story you want to tell, make stronger connections to those you lead, and ensure that you become the kind of leader you want to be.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"53863MIT63227","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Embrace Delegation as a Skill to Strengthen Remote Teams","authors":["Lebene Soga","Ben Laker","Yemisi Bolade-Ogunfodun"],"pages":"5","publication_date":"October 2021","description":"Managers of remote teams who improve their delegation skills can help solve the biggest impediment to their success — virtual distance — by closing physical, operational, and affinity gaps.

More and more companies are recognizing the value of identifying and building relationships with all of their organization's stakeholders-employees, customers, suppliers, and even communities. In fact, recent research has shown that companies that treat their employees well, create jobs in the local economy, develop innovative products and services, take care of the environment, and contribute to the community, are often more profitable.In The Stakeholder Strategy, sociologist Ann Svendsen presents an effective and practical step-by-step guide that companies can use to forge a network of powerful and profitable collaborative stakeholder relationships.While some forward-thinking corporations have tried limited collaborative approaches-focusing on one stakeholder group at a time-few have taken a comprehensive and strategic approach to building relationships with all of their stakeholders, notes Svendsen. And, while considerable commitment to the idea of stakeholder collaboration exists, there is a lack of knowledge and understanding about how to develop these relationships. The Stakeholder Strategy is the first book to show business leaders and managers how to establish and maintain positive, mutually beneficial stakeholder relationships. Based on a synthesis of ideas from community relations, corporate philanthropy, stakeholder management, organizational change, sustainability, and the corporate social responsibility literature, it offers an integrated framework, as well as the practical tools for developing new kinds of collaborative relationships.Svendsen uses easy-to-grasp concepts from everyday life, such as the process we go through in finding a mate or developing a long-term friendship, to illustrate these relationship-building strategies. She lays out the steps a company should take to create a collaboration-friendly organization: establishing a social mission, values, and ethical guidelines; assessing corporate readiness for collaboration; and making changes in communication, information and reward systems to support internal and external collaboration. Featuring case study examples from companies in North America and Europe who are working to build collaborative relationships with their stakeholders, The Stakeholder Strategy is the first book to provide a detailed explanation of how to conduct stakeholder audits and social audits so that companines can evaluate their relationship-building success and keep on track.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Strategic Thinking"]},{"id":"9781292282282","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Resilience","authors":["Jo Owen"],"pages":"304","publication_date":"November 2019","description":"Jo Owen has worked with over 100 organisations around the world in most major industries and has written 15 books on leadership and management including the best-selling How to Lead, How to Manage and Tribal Business School.

Great coaching for anyone who is even thinking of becoming an executive!”Marshall Goldsmith, New York Times bestselling author of What Got You Here Won’t Get You There\n\n“On the corporate battlefield a true leader’s success is based upon his or her ability to communicate effectively, persuade others to follow a goal, and execute it. This leads to success for all. When the stakes are high, you’re well advised to read this book first.”Scott A. Gaines, vice president, Hertz Corporation\n\n“If you are seriously looking to be perceived in the light you choose, Executive Presence is the book that not only answers the question, but shows you how to apply the answers.”Kevin Hogan, author of The Psychology of Persuasion\n\n“Harrison Monarth is a first-rate thinker who writes as clearly as he thinks. No matter where you are on the career ladder, Executive Presence will put you a step ahead of your competition.”T. Scott Gross, author of Positively Outrageous Service\n\n“Most people know that to move up in your career, you need to have self-awareness and the ability to manage the perceptions of those whose opinions count. . . . Executive Presence is your comprehensive guide to help you become more profi cient at self-marketing and the art of ethical persuasion to achieve your personal and professional goals.”Larina Kase, PsyD, MBA, author of The Confident Leader and coauthor of the New York Times bestseller The Confident Speaker\n\nAbout the Book\n\nAn expert in coaching high-level players in the art of perception management, Harrison Monarth reveals the critical difference between CEOs and those of us who wish to be CEOs. It’s not a matter of intelligence, connections, or luck. It can be summed up in two words: executive presence.\n\nWhile most of us toil in obscurity and expect great things to follow, those on the path to corporate leadership spend their time perfecting the types of leadership communication skills that generate respect and get others to share their vision. They use these skills to establish how they are perceived by others and to manage their reputation throughout the organization. In other words, these soon-tobe top players have developed the presence of an executive through careful image management—and they make sure they have the goods to back it up.\n\nIn Executive Presence, Monarth shows how you can seize control of your own career using the same skills. Inside, he explains how to:\n\nAccurately “read” people and predict their behavior\nInfluence the perceptions of others\nPersuade those of opposing views to your side\nCreate and maintain a personal “brand”\nManage and control your online reputation\nPerform damage control when things go wrong\n\nMonarth’s conclusions aren’t based solely on his keen insight and extensive experience; they’re the result of the latest scientifi c research in interpersonal communication and human behavior.\n\nTalent and skills are important, but they alone won’t take you to the top of your organization. People reach highly infl uential positions because they deeply understand the power of perception and know how to leverage it in their favor. The good news is, anyone with the will to succeed can do it. Executive Presence provides all the techniques you need to take your career to the highest level of any organization.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9780135175156","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Fundamentals of Management, 11/e","authors":["Stephen P.

Capitalism as we know it today—an amoral culture of short-term self-interest, profit maximization, emphasis on shareholder value, isolationist thinking, and profligate disregard of long-term consequences—is an unsustainable system, a monster set to consume itself.Danah Zohar and Ian Marshall argue that a critical mass of individuals acting from higher motivations can make a difference. They offer a radically new philosophy for corporate governance that alters the meaning and purpose of business and wealth creation. They describe a values-based business culture that focuses on the accumulation of “spiritual capital” rather than material capital. Rather than strictly benefiting shareholders, spiritual capital benefits all stakeholders—including the whole human race, present and future, and the planet itself. Spiritual capital nourishes and sustains the human spirit. Danah Zohar and Ian Marshall introduce the concept of spiritual intelligence (SQ), and describe how it can be used to shift individuals and our culture from a state of acting from lower motivations (fear, greed, anger, and self-assertion) to one of acting from higher motivations (exploration, cooperation, power-within, mastery, and higher service). They show how this shift actually happens in a given organizational culture. They look in depth at the issues that dominate corporate culture and examine the role of the leadership elite who must be the ones to bring about and embody this cultural shift. Finally, Zohar and Marshall argue that spiritual capital is a valid and workable form of capitalism and detail what we, as individuals, can do to make it happen.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Culture in Business"]},{"id":"9780062071002","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"The Strategist","authors":["Cynthia Montgomery"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"May 2012","description":"Based on an acclaimed professor's legendary strategy course at Harvard Business School, The Strategist offers a radically new perspective on a leader's most vital role.\n\n\"Are you a strategist?\" That's the first question Cynthia Montgomery asks the business owners and senior executives from all over the world who participate in her highly regarded executive education course. It's not a question they anticipate or care much about on opening day. But by the time the program ends, they cannot imagine leading their companies to success without being—and living the role of—a strategist.\n\nOver a series of weeks and months, Montgomery puts these accomplished executives through their paces. Using case discussions, after-hours talks, and participants' own strategy dilemmas, she illuminates what strategy is, why it's important, and what it takes to lead the effort. En route, she equips them to confront the most essential question facing every business leader: Does this company truly matter? In doing so, she shows that strategy is not just a tool for outwitting the competition; it is the most powerful means a leader has for shaping a company itself.\n\nThe Strategist exposes all business leaders—whether they run a global enterprise or a small business—to the invaluable insights Montgomery shares with these privileged executives. By distilling the experiences and insights gleaned in the classroom, Montgomery helps leaders develop the skills and sensibilities they need to become strategists themselves.

This book will help you understand the power dynamics at work between competing stakeholders with conflicting goals in projects and organizations. \n\nPolitics in Software Development consists of three main parts. Author Peter Wendorff begins by defining key concepts in organizational politics. He then moves on to software development processes and investigates how their design reflects stakeholder interests. In the final part, he highlights the role of political skill in software development and provides an overview of tactics that stakeholders frequently use.\n\nThere is widespread competition within organizations for rewards, recognition, status, and power. It gives rise to political behavior of stakeholders, which is generally seen as a problem. This negative view of organizational politics tends to overlook its positive functions. For example, it can alsobe thought of as an arena where stakeholders with conflicting goals can argue, persuade, negotiate, bargain, and cooperate to address conflicts. \n\nPolitical conflict resolution regularly happens in organizations in an entirely civilized manner. It helps find agreements that reconcile differences in a constructive way, and it is needed because stakeholder conflicts are simply a natural aspect of organizations. While there is much literature about organizational politics, very few authors consider the specifics of software development. This book addresses both subjects and is written for an audience interested in a political perspective on software development.\n\nWhat You'll Learn\n\nRecognize and understand political activities in organizations\nUnderstand what software processes have to do with stakeholder power and interests\nAcquire fundamental political skills for dealing with politics in software development\n\nWho This Book Is For\n\nProject managers, lead developers, team leaders, team coaches, product owners, business analysts, developers, and other software professionals.

Advanced consultants work with high-level executive teams on complex issues such as strategy, organizational design, merger integration, digital disruption, culture change, and system-wide transformation. While neophyte consultants are often given a playbook to follow, advanced consultants need to invent methods that take full advantage of the opportunities that their work with clients presents.

The explosive growth of the \"leadership industry\" is based on the belief that leading is a path to power and money, a medium for achievement, and a mechanism for creating change. But there are other, parallel truths: that leaders of every stripe are in disrepute; that the tireless and often superficial teaching of leadership has brought us no closer to nirvana; and that followers nearly everywhere have become, on the one hand, disappointed and disillusioned, and, on the other, entitled and emboldened.\n\nThe End of Leadership tells two tales. The first is about change—about how and why leadership and followership have changed over time, especially in the last forty years. As a result of cultural evolution and technological revolution, the balance of power between leaders and followers has shifted—with leaders becoming weaker and followers stronger.\n\nThe second narrative is about the leadership industry itself. In this provocative and critical volume, Barbara Kellerman raises questions about leadership as both a scholarly pursuit and a set of practical skills: Does the industry do what it claims to do—grow leaders? Does the research justify the undertaking? Do we adequately measure the results of our efforts? Are leaders as all-important as we think they are? What about followers? Isn't teaching good followership as important now as teaching good leadership? Finally, Kellerman asks: Given the precipitous decline of leaders in the estimation of their followers, are there alternatives to the existing models—ways of teaching leadership that take into account the vicissitudes of the twenty-first century?\n\nThe End of Leadership takes on all these questions and then some—making it necessary reading for business, political, and community leaders alike.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781119147190","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Mastering Leadership","authors":["Robert J.

However, most organizations still attack integration on a project-by-project basis, causing unnecessary expense, waste, risk, and delay. They struggle with integration “hairballs”: complex point-to-point information exchanges that are expensive to maintain, difficult to change, and unpredictable in operation.\n\nThe solution is Lean Integration. This book demonstrates how to use proven “lean” techniques to take control over the entire integration process. John Schmidt and David Lyle show how to establish “integration factories” that leverage the powerful benefits of repeatability and continuous improvement across every integration project you undertake.\n\nDrawing on their immense experience, Schmidt and Lyle bring together best practices; solid management principles; and specific, measurable actions for streamlining integration development and maintenance.\n\nWhether you’re an IT manager, project leader, architect, analyst, or developer, this book will help you systematically improve the way you integrate–adding value that is both substantial and sustainable.\n\nCoverage includes\n\nTreating integration as a business strategy and implementing management disciplines that systematically address its people, process, policy, and technology dimensions\n\nProviding maximum business flexibility and supporting rapid change without compromising stability, quality, control, or efficiency\n\nApplying improvements incrementally without “Boiling the Ocean”\n\nAutomating processes so you can deliver IT solutions faster–while avoiding the pitfalls of automation\n\nBuilding in both data and integration quality up front, rather than inspecting quality in later\n\nMore than a dozen in-depth case studies that show how real organizations are applying Lean Integration practices and the lessons they’ve learned\n\nVisit integrationfactory.com for additional resources, including more case studies, best practices, templates, software demos, and reference links, plus a direct connection to lean integration practitioners worldwide.","tags":["Business","Project & Product Management","Product Management","Lean"]},{"id":"9781633694200","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"The HBR Essential 20-Minute Manager Collection (5 Books) (HBR 20-Minute Manager Series)","authors":["Harvard Business Review"],"pages":"592","publication_date":"November 2017","description":"Whether you're starting out in your career or just want a refresher on the fundamentals, the HBR Essential 20-Minute Manager Collection gives you a hand-picked selection of concise, practical primers on the professional skills you need to master most.\n\nThis specially priced five-volume set includes:\n\nGetting Work Done\nManaging Time\nPresentations\nRunning Meetings\nDifficult Conversations\n\nYou'll learn how to:\n\nPrioritize your work\nDetermine the right time to work on each task and avoid distractions\nDeliver presentations that persuade\nPlan ahead to set your meetings up for success\nNavigate conflict while making sure all voices are heard\nAddress difficult situations without the drama\n\nDon't have much time?

Kaplan","David P. Norton"],"pages":"480","publication_date":"December 2003","description":"More than a decade ago, Robert S. Kaplan and David P. Norton introduced the Balanced Scorecard, a revolutionary performance measurement system that allowed organizations to quantify intangible assets such as people, information, and customer relationships. Then, in The Strategy-Focused Organization, Kaplan and Norton showed how organizations achieved breakthrough performance with a management system that put the Balanced Scorecard into action.Now, using their ongoing research with hundreds of Balanced Scorecard adopters across the globe, the authors have created a powerful new tool--the \"strategy map\"--that enables companies to describe the links between intangible assets and value creation with a clarity and precision never before possible. Kaplan and Norton argue that the most critical aspect of strategy--implementing it in a way that ensures sustained value creation--depends on managing four key internal processes: operations, customer relationships, innovation, and regulatory and social processes. The authors show how companies can use strategy maps to link those processes to desired outcomes; evaluate, measure, and improve the processes most critical to success; and target investments in human, informational, and organizational capital. Providing a visual \"aha!\" for executives everywhere who can't figure out why their strategy isn't working, Strategy Maps is a blueprint any organization can follow to align processes, people, and information technology for superior performance.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Strategic Thinking"]},{"id":"9781626569683","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Purpose Revolution","authors":["John B. Izzo","Jeff Vanderwielen"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"March 2018","description":"The Purpose RevolutionHow Good Leaders Create Engagement and Competitive Advantage in an Age of Social GoodWe're in the midst of a purpose revolution. Customers, employees, and investors are making it clear that they want companies to do more than provide good products, good prospects, and good profits—they want companies to do some social good too. Ironically, as this extremely timely book demonstrates, purpose-driven companies do better on nearly every traditional metric: greater customer loyalty, higher retention, more innovation, and a healthier bottom line. But how do you become a purpose-driven company? Just crafting an inspiring new mission statement and starting a CSR program won't cut it, says John Izzo, who predicted the purpose revolution in his 1994 book Awakening Corporate Soul. Purpose must pervade every part of your organization. In this thoroughly researched hands-on guide, Izzo and Jeff Vanderwielen provide a tool kit for deeply embedding purpose into your leadership and organizational culture.Using scores of real-world examples and practical exercises, Izzo and Vanderwielen help leaders find a truly authentic purpose, one that is a natural fit for them and their organization. They describe concrete actions leaders can take to ensure that employees own it, customers and recruits connect with it, and every corporate action and activity reflects it. They show leaders how to avoid common pitfalls on the path to purpose and how to use purpose to guide all their decision making. In an increasingly crowded economic landscape, purpose gives you a powerful competitive advantage. But it does more than that. Finding and communicating an inspiring purpose will revitalize the entire organization, top to bottom. Purpose makes business more rewarding in every sense.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781586445461","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Best Boss Ever","authors":["Kris Dunn"],"pages":"296","publication_date":"June 2023","description":"Learn how to manage teams and lead with confidence using practical tools, real talk and a dash of humor.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Team Management"]},{"id":"9781394201983","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"How NOT to Lead","authors":["Chase Cunningham"],"pages":"224","publication_date":"January 2024","description":"Step Aside, Mediocre Leaders: Learn What NOT To Do!\n\nDitch the fluff and sugarcoating and learn how to lead the way your people deserve.

Other times the mentor is a senior engineer who can act as a technical mentor in addition to helping the new hire get up to speed on the process. In a healthy organization, this onboarding mentorship role is used as an opportunity for both parties.

At a workshop in Tennessee taught by a Vietnam veteran, he learned about the \"prey drive\" of war dogs—an instinctive inclination to find, pursue, and capture their prey.\n\nIn Flip the Switch, Coach Burt shows how humans, too, have this instinctive drive—not for hunting prey, but for pursuing goals with a persistence and intensity that goes far beyond the usual efforts applied to everyday tasks.

Supported by over 30 years of research, from over seventy countries, and with examples from real-world leaders, Learning Leadership is a clarion call to unleash the leadership potential that is already present in society today.\n\nLearning Leadership provides readers with evidence-based strategies to ignite the habit of continuous improvement and the mindset of becoming the best leaders they can be. Emerging leaders, as well as leadership developers, internal and external coaches and trainers, and other human resource professionals will learn from first-hand stories and practical examples so that they can deeply understand and apply the fundamentals for becoming the best leaders they can be.\n\nLearning Leadership: The Five Fundamentals of Becoming an Exemplary Leader is divided into digestible bite-sized chapters that encourage daily actions to becoming a better leader. Key takeaways from the book include:\n\nBelieve in Yourself.  Believing in oneself is the essential first step in developing leadership competencies. The best leaders are learners, and they can’t achieve mastery until and unless they truly decide that inside them there is a person who can make and difference and learn to be a better leader than they are right now.\nAspire to Excel. To become an exemplary leader, people must determine what they care most about and why they want to lead. Leaders with values-based motivations are the most likely to excel. They also must have a clear image of the kind of leader they want to be in the future—and the legacy they want to leave for others. \nChallenge Yourself. Challenging oneself is critical to learning leadership. Leaders must seek new experiences and test themselves. There will be inevitable setbacks and failures along the way that require curiosity, grit, courage, and resilience to persist in learning and becoming the best.\nEngage Support. One can’t lead alone, and one can’t learn alone. It is essential to get support and coaching on the path to achieving excellence. Whether it’s family, managers at work, or professional coaches, leaders need the advice, feedback, care, and support of others.\nPractice Deliberately. No one gets better at anything without continuous practice. Exemplary leaders spend more time practicing than ordinary leaders. Simply being in the role of a leader is insufficient. To achieve mastery, leaders must set improvement goals, participate in designed learning experiences, ask for feedback, and get coaching. They also put in the time every day and make learning leadership a daily habit.\n\nKouzes and Posner offer unrivaled insights into what it means to become an exemplary leader in today’s world with their original research and over 30 years of experience studying the practices of extraordinary leadership. They show that anyone can become a better leader if they believe in themselves, aspire to excel, challenge themselves to grow, engage the support of others, and practice deliberately.  Learning Leadership challenges readers to do the meaningful and disciplined work necessary to becoming the best they can, using a new mindset and toolkit that can make extraordinary things happen.  It’s not the once-in-a-while transformational acts that demonstrate leadership. It’s the little things that one does day in and day out that pave the path to greatness.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781647825164","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"HBR Guide to Executing Your Strategy","authors":["Harvard Business Review"],"pages":"272","publication_date":"August 2023","description":"Put your strategy into action.\n\nEven the best competitive strategies mean nothing if they aren't executed well.

Turn on the TV. Incompetent leadership is everywhere, and there's no denying that most of these leaders are men.\n\nIn this timely and provocative book, Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic asks two powerful questions: Why is it so easy for incompetent men to become leaders? And why is it so hard for competent people--especially competent women--to advance?\n\nMarshaling decades of rigorous research, Chamorro-Premuzic points out that although men make up a majority of leaders, they underperform when compared with female leaders. In fact, most organizations equate leadership potential with a handful of destructive personality traits, like overconfidence and narcissism. In other words, these traits may help someone get selected for a leadership role, but they backfire once the person has the job.\n\nWhen competent women--and men who don't fit the stereotype--are unfairly overlooked, we all suffer the consequences. The result is a deeply flawed system that rewards arrogance rather than humility, and loudness rather than wisdom.\n\nThere is a better way. With clarity and verve, Chamorro-Premuzic shows us what it really takes to lead and how new systems and processes can help us put the right people in charge.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781119717911","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Leading from the Middle","authors":["Scott Mautz"],"pages":"224","publication_date":"May 2021","description":"The definitive playbook for driving impact as a middle manager\n\nLeading from the Middle: A Playbook for Managers to Influence Up, Down, and Across the Organization delivers an insightful and practical guide for the backbone of an organization: those who have a boss and are a boss and must lead from the messy middle.

You have to make good decisions while balancing inevitable tensions and knowing when to take risks.

At its core, leadership is a daily, ongoing practice, a journey toward becoming your best self and inviting others to do the same. And at the heart of this daily practice is courage. And that's where The Courage Way comes in. It's a guide to leadership that names and explores this important resource and shows leaders how to access and draw upon courage in all that they do. It has its roots in the work of Parker J. Palmer, who in fifty years of teaching, speaking, and writing has explored the human spirit—what he has called “the inner landscape”—and its role in life and leadership.Shelly Francis identifies key ingredients needed to cultivate courage, the most fundamental being trust—in ourselves and in each other. She describes the Center for Courage & Renewal's Circle of Trust approach, centered around eleven “touchstones,” poetic and practical operating guidelines for holding the meaningful conversations of inner work and trust building. Each chapter features true stories of how leaders in all kinds of settings have overcome challenges and strengthened their organizations through touchstones like “Extend invitation, not demand,” “No fixing, saving, advising, or correcting,” and “When the going gets rough, turn to wonder.”This graceful and inspiring book is a guide to courageous leadership and a journey of self-discovery—the two are inextricable.

It takes grit, courage, and vision, among other things, that can be hard to come by on your toughest days. When leaders and aspiring leaders seek out advice, they're often told to try harder. Dig deeper. Look in the mirror and own your natural-born strengths and fix any real or perceived career-limiting deficiencies.\n\nFrances Frei and Anne Morriss offer a different worldview. They argue that this popular leadership advice glosses over the most important thing you do as a leader: build others up. Leadership isn't about you. It's about how effective you are at empowering other people—and making sure this impact endures even in your absence. As Frei and Morriss show through inspiring stories from ancient Rome to present-day Silicon Valley, the origins of great leadership are found, paradoxically, not in worrying about your own status and advancement, but in the unrelenting focus on other people's potential.\n\nUnleashed provides radical advice for the practice of leadership today. Showing how the boldest, most effective leaders use a special combination of trust, love, and belonging to create an environment in which other people can excel, Frei and Morriss offer practical, battle-tested tools—based on their work with companies such as Uber, Riot Games, WeWork, and others—along with interviews and stories from their own personal experience, to make these ideas come alive.

You’ll learn how an obsession with volume leads inexorably to rising costs and falling margins...how companies fall victim to denial, myth, ritual, and orthodoxy... how they start wasting vital energy on culture confl ict and turf wars...how they blind themselves to emerging competition...how they become arrogant, complacent, and far too dependent on their traditional competences. Most important, you’ll find specific, detailed techniques for “curing”–or, better yet, preventing–every one of these self-destructive habits.\n\nThe “cocoon” of denialFind it, admit it, assess it, and escape it\n\nThe stigma of arroganceEscape this fault that “breeds in a dark, closed room”\n\nThe virus of complacencySix warning signs and five solutions\n\nThe curse of incumbencyStop your core competencies from blinding you to new opportunities\n\nThe threat of myopiaWiden your view of your competitors–and the dangers they pose\n\nThe obsession of volumeGet beyond “rising volumes and shrinking margins”\n\nThe territorial impulseBreak down the silos, factions, fiefdoms, and ivory towers\n\nPreface xxi\n\nForeword    xxiii                                                                            \n\n1          Why Do Good Companies Go Bad?   1                           \n\n2          Denial: The Cocoon of Myth, Ritual, and Orthodoxy      19  \n\n3          Arrogance: Pride before the Fall    45\n\n4          Complacency: Success Breeds Failure    75                        \n\n5          Competency Dependence: The Curse of Incumbency    105      \n\n6          Competitive Myopia: A Nearsighted View of Competition    133\n\n7          Volume Obsession: Rising Costs and Falling Margins    165    \n\n8          The Territorial Impulse: Culture Conflicts and Turf Wars    199   \n\n9          The Best Cure is No Cure at All    231                          /p>\n\n10        Endnotes    249                                                                    \n\nIndex    263","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781394165261","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Beekeeper","authors":["Katie P.

In truth, though, they just fall back on exclusionary behaviors, like revering the typically male \"lone genius\" who is essential to their innovative future. Why the disconnect?\n\nAccording to Telle Whitney, cofounder of the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing, while tech leaders may want to talk about inclusivity, few actually change their cultures to dismantle the unwelcoming environment, fearful that doing so will compromise innovation. Women and people of color pay the price, facing exclusive and even hostile workplaces. They're held back from professional growth and, in many cases, choose to leave the industry altogether.\n\nBut there is a solution. In Rebooting Tech Culture, Whitney argues that the same values at the heart of innovation—creativity, courage, confidence, curiosity, communication, and community—can also foster a culture that’s welcoming to all employees. Drawing on more than fifty interviews with tech executives and a survey of a thousand people in tech, she shows how these \"six Cs\" can power real change in technology organizations, creating workplaces where anyone can be successful and where innovation thrives.\n\nToday, every company is a tech company. By understanding how to apply these values and reinvigorate their cultures, leaders will learn how to eliminate the behaviors holding their teams back from true belonging, growth, and innovation.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Culture in Business"]},{"id":"9781398621015","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Mindset of Success, 3rd Edition","authors":["Jo Owen"],"pages":"320","publication_date":"June 2025","description":"Unlock your leadership potential by acquiring the seven key mindsets that lead to leadership success.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781398605183","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Mindset Matters","authors":["Gemma Leigh Roberts"],"pages":"288","publication_date":"May 2022","description":"Develop mental agility and resilience to take on disruption and navigate change at work and with your teams.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Team Management","Remote Work Management"]},{"id":"53863MIT62424","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"What Makes Successful Frameworks Rise Above the Rest","authors":["David Gray"],"pages":"8","publication_date":"April 2021","description":"Conceptual frameworks like the BCG growth share matrix and SWOT analysis have had an enduring impact on business strategy and practice.

As new technology and digital strategies are integrated, workers at all levels will be required to build capability much faster than before, navigating more complex systems and processes. Yet, learning and development (L&D) has lagged in this area, as too many L&D functions still focus on transactional interactions across a broad and complex portfolio while starved for resources.\n\nIn L&D’s Playbook for the Digital Age, Brandon Carson makes the case that it’s time to reorient L&D, take a more proactive role in enabling the workforce, and create a new framework for developing skills and capabilities. L&D leaders must realize theirs is one of the most critical business functions and must be appropriately funded and resourced to realize the performance gains that are crucial to the business.\n\nL&D cannot be caught standing still and, in fact, needs a new playbook to navigate the radical and complex transformation the digital age is demanding. Stemming from the sports world, a playbook ensures the players know their roles, connect as a team, and understand the winning strategy and how to execute the game plan. For L&D, a playbook can help build alignment across the team and with stakeholders by being flexible as business needs change.\n\nCarson walks you through the steps to formulate how a new playbook could help the alignment of your L&D function—whether it’s restructuring, new skilling, or rescoping. He asks readers to speak the language of business instead of the language of learning. For example, does your workforce repair aircraft or do they enable safe flight? In other words, can you be the visionary your organization requires?","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management"]},{"id":"9780071774352","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Big Book of Virtual Teambuilding Games: Quick, Effective Activities to Build Communication, Trust and Collaboration from Anywhere!","authors":["Mary Scannell","Michael Abrams","Mike Mulvihill"],"pages":"256","publication_date":"December 2011","description":"Get remote team members to interact as if they’re in the same room!\n\nWhether you’re videoconferencing with team members across the world or e-mailing a colleague sitting ten feet away, the truth is evident: technology has permanently altered the way we communicate.

But this type of leadership—what Dean Williams calls \"counterfeit leadership\"—generates an unhealthy dependence on an authority figure and relies on dominance, control, and group seduction to get things done. By hampering people's ability to anticipate and react to changing circumstances, it creates a self-limiting cycle. And if the leader's vision is flawed, the entire organization suffers.The true task of a leader, Williams argues, is to get people to face the reality of any situation themselves and develop strategies to deal with problems or take advantage of opportunities. Real leaders don't dictate; they help people face their challenges and make adjustments in their values, habits, practices, and priorities to ensure the enterprise is given its best chance to succeed. Williams details how to apply this new approach to the challenges every organization or community faces. Throughout, he demonstrates the practical application of real leadership in the real world through examples from his own experiences working with organizations as diverse as the government of Singapore, Aetna Life and Casualty, and the nomadic Penan tribe in Borneo, as well as historical examples and the insights gleaned from his many interviews with presidents, prime ministers, and business leaders.

In a word: RESPECT\n\nThe best leaders are the ones who motivate employees to want to perform at the highest level possible--which is never accomplished with an iron-fist style of management. The best results are achieved through one of the most basic human behaviors: the showing of respect.\n\nOrganizational change expert Paul Meshanko has studied how the human brain responds in various workplace situations--and his conclusion is astonishing: People perform at their highest level when treated with respect. Conversely, when an employee is emotionally attacked by disrespectful behavior, he or she shuts down. In The Respect Effect, Meshanko reveals the transformational power of respect in the workplace.\n\nGiven the pressures of the workplace, this is sometimes easier said than done. So Meshanko provides a practical action plan you can use to train yourself or others to get on track--and stay on track. His proven strategy helps you understand the initial, biological reactions to what people (This means you!) say and do.\n\nThrough his cited research in neuroscience, Meshanko teaches you how to create positive situations, avoid negative ones, and ultimately build a better work environment for everyone. The Respect Effect explains:\n\nThe hard science proving why respect is the most powerful employee motivator\nHow to build a corporate culture based on respect, starting with senior leadership\nThe 12 Rules of Respect--simple but powerful ways to communicate respectfully in any situation\nThe strategy, resource requirements, and tools for sustaining a respectful workplace culture\n\nHow do you use the concept of neuroscience to achieve a great work environment? The answer is obvious. Feed others a diet of respect--real, deserved, genuine respect--and you will see amazing things happen in your organization.\n\nUse Meshanko's proven approach to organizational change to create a culture of contagious respect in your organization.\n\nPRAISE FOR THE RESPECT EFFECT:\n\n\"The Respect Effect reminds us of the critical role relationships play in the workforce. . . . A great read for new and experienced leaders!\" -- ANNEMARIE M. GRASSI, PH.D., CEO, Open Doors Academy\n\n\"The Respect Effect offers concise, engaging learning, not only for business leaders, but for anyone working in an organization where developing an inclusive and productive work environment is a priority.

Employee engagement and loyalty expert Heather Younger outlines nine ways to manifest the radical power of caring support in the workplace.Heather Younger argues that if you are looking for increased productivity, customer satisfaction, or employee engagement, you need to care for your employees first. People will go the extra mile for leaders who show they are genuinely concerned not just with what employees can do but with who they are and can become. But while most leaders think of themselves as caring leaders, not all demonstrate that care in consistent ways. Your employees will judge you by your actions, not your intentions. Based on Younger's interviews with over eighty leaders for her podcast Leadership with Heart—including Howard Behar, former president of the Starbucks Coffee Company; Judith Scimone, senior vice president and chief talent officer at MetLife; Garry Ridge, CEO and chairman of the board of the WD-40 Company; and Shawnté Cox Holland, head of culture and engagement at Vanguard—this book outlines nine ways that leaders can make all employees feel included and cared for. She even provides access to a self-assessment so you can measure your progress as a caring leader. But this is not a cookie-cutter approach: just as Monet and Picasso expressed themselves very differently, each leader should express caring in his or her own unique, personal style. Younger takes an often nebulous, subjective concept and makes it concrete and actionable. Leaders have the power to change the lives of those they lead. They shouldn't just want to care, they should see caring as imperative for the success of their employees and their organization.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781118616376","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"The Profitable Consultant: Starting, Growing, and Selling Your Expertise","authors":["Jay Niblick","Marshall Goldsmith"],"pages":"274","publication_date":"April 2013","description":"Selling can be uncomfortable for professional business consultants and executive coaches.

Now remind yourself that other leaders share some or all of these qualities with you.\n\nThe leaders you are called upon to lead may be other executives, highly educated experts, investors, board members, government officials, doctors, lawyers, or other professionals.

The seven tasks and the special challenges they entail in leading leaders are:\n\n1. Direction How do you negotiate a vision for the organization that other leaders will buy into?\n\n2.

They can remember the unity of purpose they experienced, the powerful passion that inspired them, and the incredible results they achieved. People who have been on a great team can attest that the difference between being on a team with a shared vision and being on a team without one is the difference between joy and misery.\n\nIn 1996, Jim and Michele McCarthy, after successful careers leading software development teams at Microsoft and elsewhere, set out to discover a set of repeatable group behaviors that would always lead to the formation of a state of shared vision for any team. They hoped for a practical, communicable, and reliable process that could be used to create the best possible teams every time it was applied. They established a hands-on laboratory for the study and teaching of high-performance teamwork. In a controlled simulation environment, their principle research and teaching effort--the McCarthy Software Development BootCamp--challenged dozens of real-world, high-tech teams to produce and deliver a product. Teams were given a product development assignment, and instructed to form a team, envision the product, agree on how to make it, then design, build, and ship it on time. By repeating these simulations time after time, with the new teams building on the learning from previous teams, core practices emerged that were repeatedly successful. These were encoded as patterns and protocols.\n\nSoftware for Your Head is the first publication of the most significant results of the authors' unprecedented five-year investigation into the dynamics of contemporary teams. The information in this book will provide a means for any team to create for itself a compelling state of shared vision.\n\n0201604566B09042001","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management"]},{"id":"9781633692848","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Leadership on the Line, With a New Preface","authors":["Ronald Heifetz","Marty Linsky"],"pages":"288","publication_date":"June 2017","description":"The dangerous work of leading change--somebody has to do it.

It requires putting yourself on the line, disrupting the status quo, and surfacing hidden conflict. And when people resist and push back, there's a strong temptation to play it safe. Those who choose to lead plunge in, take the risks, and sometimes get burned. But it doesn't have to be that way say renowned leadership experts Ronald Heifetz and Marty Linsky.

Most on-the-job training programs leave learners to sink or swim with whomever is overseeing their work. One worker may excel with a mentor who allows her to take charge of what she learns—while a second may get someone who uses the opportunity to offload paperwork and other administrative tasks.\n\nLearning While Working: Structuring Your On-the-Job Training shows you how to provide the focus and direction needed to track on-the-job progress and build a pipeline of better-skilled workers. Author Paul Smith combines real insight into building a structured program for project managers at the Waldinger Corporation with in-depth interviews of experienced learning and development professionals. Discover how a well-designed structured on-the-job training program can be your company’s talent development answer to a Swiss Army knife.\n\nThis book doesn’t prescribe a one-size-fits-all solution.

In Ruthless Consistency, he identifies the three surprising reasons most strategic change initiatives fail:\n\nLeaders unwittingly send mixed messages that demotivate their people and undermine those initiatives.\nLeaders focus on what they do instead of what their people experience.\nLeaders are not as committed as they think they are or need to be.\n\nThe book then introduces an intuitive yet comprehensive model for success. Simply put, leaders who develop the right focus, create the right environment, and build the right team—consistently—are leaders whose organizations win.

These seminars, done for such organizations as Banner Health, General Dynamics, Scripps Hospital, Wells Fargo Banks, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and M&I Banks, appeal to managers, teachers, parents, CEOs, and coaches everywhere.\n\nThe first step in motivating others is for you, if you’re the leader wanting the motivation, to realize that “if there’s a problem, I’m the problem.” Once you truly get that, then you can use these 100 ways. After you’ve learned to motivate yourself, Steve and Scott will help you learn:\n\n• How to slow down and enjoy a new level of focus\n\n• Why multitasking is a myth, not a strength, and keeping life simple and straightforward is the goal\n\n• The power of building on your peoples’ strengths\n\n• How to avoid the damaging inclination to obsess about people’s weaknesses\n\n• A simple and creative way to hold people accountable\n\n• How to enjoy cultivating the art of supportive confrontation.\n\nThis book inspires extremely tough-minded leadership that gives the gift of clarity and vision to every person following the leader.\n\n100 Ways to Motivate Others rides on the crest of the international success of Steve Chandler’s 100 Ways to Motivate Yourself. Chandler has written eight books and has been translated into seven languages, including best-sellers in China and Japan. He graduated from the University of Arizona with a degree in Creative Writing and Political Science, and spent four years in the US Army in Psychological Warfare. He and Scott Richardson live in Phoenix, Ariz., and provide leadership coaching and training throughout the world","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Team Management"]},{"id":"9781647824778","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"X-Teams, Revised and Updated","authors":["Deborah Ancona","Henrik Bresman"],"pages":"224","publication_date":"August 2023","description":"An essential work on teams—now updated with new research and tools and a new preface—X-Teams shows how an externally focused team model is the key to fueling innovation and your organization's success.\n\nYou build a team around top-notch talent. The team members work well together; they're committed to the mission and are highly motivated to perform. Yet the results are disappointing. You're not seeing creativity and flexibility. You're not getting breakthrough ideas.\n\n\"Good\" teams build camaraderie, confidence in their abilities, and a solid process for working together. But these internal dynamics—while positive in themselves—can create a wall between the team and the outside world. And that wall can prevent the team from adapting to change and delivering value to the organization.\n\nIn this updated, streamlined edition, with a new preface and practical tools, Deborah Ancona and Henrik Bresman describe an externally focused team model—the x-team—that is even more relevant today than when it was first introduced. With their distinctively flexible membership and leadership structure, x-teams continuously reach outward to fuel the innovation process.\n\nWith new examples and research from organizations such as Microsoft, Takeda, and the Museum of Modern Art, Ancona and Bresman show you how to build x-teams that:\n\nKeep pace with shifts in markets, technologies, cultures, and your competition\nInnovate by moving quickly from generating ideas to executing and diffusing them throughout your organization\nEmploy \"distributed leadership\" to unlock crucial information, expertise, and new ways of working together—wherever these qualities reside, whether within or outside your company\n\nIn an increasingly complex and ever-changing world, where adaptability and creativity are paramount to an enterprise's success—and even its survival—X-Teams is your handbook for winning.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Team Management"]},{"id":"9781523093236","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Leading with Love and Laughter","authors":["Zina Sutch","Patrick Malone"],"pages":"192","publication_date":"May 2021","description":"Leadership has for too long been treated as a model and not as a relationship. Zina Sutch and Patrick Malone argue that successful leadership must be based on love (altruism and empathy) and laughter (positive emotions and joy).Recent bestselling books have completely altered the way we understand how humans work and play together. The Altruistic Brain and Born to Be Good show that humans are deeply wired for empathy and compassion. The Social Animal and Emotional Intelligence prove that our emotional selves help us make better decisions and motivate others. However, the tactics we use to train leaders bear little reflection of these advancements; we're still creating competent but emotionally distant leaders who “manage human assets” and lead by setting goals, deadlines, and deliverables.Zina Sutch and Patrick Malone hope to flip a light switch and illuminate, above all else, that leadership begins with heart and soul. In five succinct chapters, they show that we lead best when we tap into our genetically driven human nature to love and nurture, connect and trust.

Clark breaks it all down into six key behaviors:\n\nConnecting: Form solid relationships with coworkers and align your behavior to the organization’s culture and goalsShaping: Seize opportunities for tailoring experiences based on your personal preferencesLearning: Take proactive measures to learn at or above the speed of changeStretching: Move out of your comfort zone and take calculated risksAchieving: Accomplish your goalsContributing: Make personal contributions that drive lasting positive change to others and to the company\n\nThe Employee Engagement Mindset provides practical advice on how any employee can put him or herself on the fast track to true engagement using this six-part model.

With eye-opening case studies and recommended behaviors in every chapter, it's an indispensable user guide for servant leaders.”—Ken Blanchard, coauthor of The New One Minute Manager and coeditor of Servant Leadership in ActionOn the most fundamental level, leaders must bring divergent groups together and forge a consensus on a path forward. But what makes that possible? Humility—a deep regard for the dignity of others—is the key, says distinguished leadership educator Marilyn Gist.Leadership is a relationship, and humility is the foundation for all healthy relationships. Leader humility can increase engagement and retention. It inspires and motivates. Gist offers a model of leader humility derived from three questions people ask of their leaders: Who are you? Where are we going? Do you see me? She explores each of these questions in depth, as well as the six key qualities of leader humility: a balanced ego, integrity, a compelling vision, ethical strategies, generous inclusion, and a developmental focus. Much of this book is based on Gist's interviews with a dozen distinguished leaders of organizations such as the Mayo Clinic, Costco, REI, Alaska Airlines, Starbucks, and others. And the foreword and a guest chapter are written by Alan Mulally, the legendary leader who brought Ford back from the brink of bankruptcy after the 2008 financial collapse and whose work is an exemplar of leader humility.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781633694019","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"You at Work: Dealing with Setbacks","authors":["Harvard Business Review"],"pages":"52","publication_date":"December 2016","description":"Even the most successful professionals encounter hurdles at some point in their careers.

In the management context leadership has been consistently identified as playing a critical role in the success or failure of organizations and some surveys have pegged almost half of an organization’s performance on the quality and effectiveness of its leadership team. Apart from organizational performance, researchers have consistently found a strong correlation between leadership styles and behaviors and the job satisfaction and performance of subordinates.\n\nWhen formal interest in the study of leadership first began in the 19th and early 20th centuries, the so-called “great man” theory, which assumed that certain individual characteristics or traits could be found in leaders but not in non-leaders and that those characteristics could not be developed but must be inherited, was quite popular and many assumed that leaders were simply “born and not made”. As time passed, however, the consensus within the community of leadership scholars and consultants shifted significantly to the current working proposition that while some people do indeed appear to be natural leaders from birth it is nonetheless possible for many others with sufficient desire and willpower to develop into a “leader” by following a continuous process of work, self-study, education, training and experience.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781259584459","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Real Leadership: 9 Simple Practices for Leading and Living with Purpose","authors":["John Addison","John David Mann"],"pages":"240","publication_date":"March 2016","description":"Leadership lessons for enduring business and personal success from renowned motivational speaker, current leadership editor of Success magazine and former co-CEO of Primerica, John Addison\n\nIn Real Leadership, author John Addison shares his straightforward practices for successful leadership through his personal and professional journey, helping leaders at any level understand and emulate the nine principles that fostered enduring results on his path to success.\n\nAs co-CEO of Primerica--the largest independent financial services marketing organization in North America--from 1999 to 2015, Addison  spearheaded the company through a period of rapid growth in the early 2000's, then helped navigate the company through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, and the separation from their parent company, Citibank, which created one of the most successful IPOs of the decade.\n\nGuiding the organization through these monumental changes while also working to keep morale high, Addison developed a passion and talent for motivating others that allowed him to inspire and empower over a million people during his career.\n\nThe perspectives and personal laws of success that he’s developed over decades of hard work and diligence boil down to the principles of living your best life.

And with the relationship between worker and organization constantly changing, no one person will likely be able to lead alone. Creating Leaderful Organizations presents a paradigm of leadership tailored to our times, one that is based on mutual-rather than heroic-leadership.It is not merely consultative, with leaders graciously allowing followers to participate in leadership, nor is it a stewardship approach in which the leader occasionally steps aside to allow others to take over temporarily. It is a revolutionary new approach that transforms leadership from an individual property to a collective responsibility. Raelin details how \"leaderful\" practice can accomplish the critical processes of leadership more effectively than any existing approach. And using actual examples from leading-edge organizations, he offers practical guidance for assessing your own and others' leaderful predisposition, preparing for leaderful practice, distributing leadership roles, and dealing with resistance to change.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9780730390879","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Work From Anywhere","authors":["Alison Hill","Darren Hill"],"pages":"256","publication_date":"April 2021","description":"Bring out the best in your hybrid team with this invaluable resource\n\nWork from Anywhere delivers practical strategies and actionable guidance on how to develop a high performing team and business in a remote and distributed environment.

But leaders know that today, pressures for change don't come at you one at a time; they come all at once. It's like riding a roller coaster: sudden drops, jarring turns, anxious climbs into the unknown. Drawing on his years of experience at the Center for Creative Leadership and Columbia University, Bill Pasmore offers a four-part model and four mindsets that allow leaders to deal with multiple changes simultaneously without drowning in the churn. The first step, Pasmore says, is to Discover which external pressures for change are the most necessary to address. The key here is to think fewer—step away from the buffet of possibilities and pinpoint the highest-impact options. Then you need to Decide how many change efforts your organization can handle. Here the mindset is to think scarcer—you have only so many people and so many resources, so how do you best use them? Once you've figured that out, it's time to Do—and here you want to think faster. Streamline processes and engage in rapid prototyping so you can learn quickly and cost-effectively.

That's because the majority of organizations don't know how to bridge the canyons that exist between executives, managers, and front-line employees. Most strategic initiatives fail when a company tries to execute strategy despite its people rather than through them.\n\nAs CEO of consultancy Root Learning, Jim Haudan has more than twenty years experience helping businesses bridge these canyons and achieve their strategic goals. Here, he shares his secrets for driving this strategic execution. Refreshingly accessible, this important book presents executives, managers, and team leaders with a proven, effective way to communicate, empower, and motivate employees at every level of an organization.\n\nThrough stories, illustrations, and insightful observations Haudan explores the concept of engagement in business--from the “roots of engagement” to the six reasons why so many workers rank themselves as disengaged to the keys to unlocking engagement in any organization. He also includes a framework for implementing the process of strategically engaging employees as well as a self-assessment for checking your own company's level of strategic engagement.\n\nThe Art of Engagement equips you with a range of tools--sketches, illustrations, and highly visual “learning maps”--to help employees speak the same language, see from the same point of view, and connect their individual actions to the success of the whole company. Included are:\n\nEngaging visual learning tools designed to help you communicate more effectively with your workforce\nProven methods for successfully engaging employees at every level of an organization\nReal-world case studies of such organizations as Harley-Davidson, Pepsi Cola, and Blockbuster\n\nA strategy may look perfect on paper, but it's worthless if leaders forget that human beings have to implement it.

And the assessment process they use to decide who is and isn't a future leader is an even greater mystery.\n\nThe High Potential's Advantage takes you behind the scenes and shows how you can get on, and stay on, your company's fast track. Leadership development experts Jay Conger and Allan Church draw upon decades of research and experience--designing high-potential programs for hundreds of large well-known global organizations and assessing and coaching thousands of talented leaders--to answer the critical questions asked by ambitious individuals like you: What will it take for me to advance in this organization? What does my boss look for when deciding whether I’m a high potential? Once I'm on the list, then what? Can I fall off it and, if so, what do I do?\n\nRevealing the key differentiators--five critical \"X factors\"--that set people apart across companies of all types, Conger and Church show what you need to do to achieve and maintain top-talent status. You’ll find detailed advice for cultivating and practicing each X factor, with numerous and rich examples from those on the verge of their first promotion to those only a step away from the C-suite. The High Potential's Advantage also shows you how to gain insight into and excel at the specific process your company uses to identify and develop high potentials--and how to determine which unique capabilities your company values the most.

Written by a 30-year veteran of the leadership consulting industry and author of Trust in the Balance, the book contains examples, worksheets and surveys that illustrate the practical application of the advice presented. An online questionnaire helps readers discover their own leadership vulnerabilities, and the book provides a roadmap for creating a targeted plan to increase their awareness in the areas that truly matter.\n\nThe blindspot risk is that leaders fail to respond to weaknesses or threats due to a variety of factors including the complexity of their organizations, over-confidence in their own capabilities, and being surrounded by deferential subordinates. Leadership Blindspots provides a useful model for understanding how blindspots operate and why they persist, but at the same time suggests real, actionable steps to improvement. The book details a range of techniques that make blindspots stand out in sharp relief, so action can be taken before severe damage occurs - to a leader or his or her company. Topics include:\n\nA framework to understand the threats posed by blindspots\n\nThe four most important types of blindspots - self, team, company and markets\n\nDetailed case studies of blindspots in leaders across a variety of industries\n\nA summary of the most common leadership blindspots\n\nCorrective practices that help mitigate the risks that blindspots pose\n\nThe one characteristic great leaders share is the constant desire for self-improvement. Good can always be better. These weaknesses and threats are called blindspots because they are invisible to the individual but have the potential to wreak havoc on one's reputation and long-term success. Identifying and fixing crucial problems is the leader's job, and sometimes the most debilitating problems are with the leaders themselves. Leadership Blindspots: How Successful Leaders Identify and Overcome the Weaknesses That Matter is the first step toward owning and addressing one's vulnerabilities and, as a result, becoming a more effective leader.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9780749483067","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Accelerated Leadership Development","authors":["Ines Wichert"],"pages":"248","publication_date":"July 2018","description":"Develop employees swiftly and effectively for leadership roles in your organization.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781523094370","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Leadership from the Inside Out, 3rd Edition","authors":["Kevin Cashman"],"pages":"272","publication_date":"October 2017","description":"Grow the Whole Person to Grow the Whole LeaderThis long-awaited third edition turns leadership development inside out for a new generation of authentic, purpose-inspired leaders.

And with good reasonreorgs are one of the best ways for companies to unlock latent value, especially in a changing business environment.But everyone hates them.No other management practice creates more anxiety and fear among employees or does more to distract them from their day-to-day jobs. As a result, reorgs can be incredibly expensive in terms of senior-management time and attention, and most of them fail on multiple dimensions. It’s no wonder companies treat a reorg as a mysterious process and outsource it to people who don’t understand the business. It doesn’t have to be this way.Stephen Heidari-Robinson and Suzanne Heywood, former leaders in McKinsey’s Organization Practice, present a practical guide for successfully planning and implementing a reorg in five stepsdemystifying and accelerating the process at the same time.

It isn’t rocket science and it isn’t bogged down by a lot of organizational theory: the five steps give people a simple, logical process to follow, making it easier for everyoneboth the leaders and the employees who ultimately determine a reorg’s success or failureto commit themselves to and succeed in the new organization.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management"]},{"id":"9781040035894","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Keep Your Day Job","authors":["Dannie Fountain"],"pages":"104","publication_date":"June 2024","description":"As Millennials and Gen Z grow their influence in the workplace, side hustling and overemployment are emerging from the dark corners of the corporate world—but many companies still resist this trend.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Culture in Business"]},{"id":"9780071804639","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Coaching for Breakthrough Success: Proven Techniques for Making Impossible Dreams Possible","authors":["Jack Canfield","Peter Chee"],"pages":"240","publication_date":"October 2012","description":"A powerful new coaching method from Chicken Soup for the Soul co-creator Jack Canfield!\n\nConveying his one-of-a-kind insight in the friendly, supremely organized way that has made him a household name, Canfield teams up with development guru Peter Chee to deliver the 30 top coaching principles you can put to use right away.

Polski begins by uncovering the remarkable neurobiological underpinnings of policy. Polski reveals why the most effective political and economic policies are codified not in law, treaty, or culture, but in the networks embedded in our bodies and brains...and how protecting our prosperity requires us to adapt those networks to radically new realities.\n\nNext, Polski applies these fresh insights to three critical security issues: how best to defend our national interests; to take offensive action to protect our interests; and to strengthen our financial system. Finally, she provides “rules for the road” that can be applied to a world of problems: how best to compete in global markets; to build stronger, more secure communities; to manage energy and other key resources; to invest in and secure critical infrastructure; to address the structural impacts of trade; and to manage tomorrow’s catastrophes, both natural and man-made.\n\nAs a political economist, executive, government advisor, and consultant, Polski has spent more than two decades devising strategies for surviving change in the global political economy.

From New York to Barcelona to Hong Kong, it can feel as if the world as we know it is coming apart. Through it all, our human spirit is being tested. Now more than ever, it's imperative for leaders to demonstrate compassion.\n\nBut in hard times like these, leaders need to make hard decisions—deliver negative feedback, make difficult choices that disappoint people, and in some cases lay people off. How do you do the hard things that come with the responsibility of leadership while remaining a good human being and bringing out the best in others? Most people think we have to make a binary choice between being a good human being and being a tough, effective leader. But this is a false dichotomy. Being human and doing what needs to be done are not mutually exclusive. In truth, doing hard things and making difficult decisions is often the most compassionate thing to do.\n\nAs founder and CEO of Potential Project, Rasmus Hougaard and his longtime coauthor, Jacqueline Carter, show in this powerful, practical book, you must always balance caring for your people with leadership wisdom and effectiveness. Using data from thousands of leaders, employees, and companies in nearly a hundred countries, the authors find that when leaders bring the right balance of compassion and wisdom to the job, they foster much higher levels of employee engagement, performance, loyalty, and well-being in their people.\n\nWith rich examples from Netflix, IKEA, Unilever, and many other global companies, as well as practical tools and advice for leaders and managers at any level, Compassionate Leadership is your indispensable guide to doing the hard work of leadership in a human way.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781523004102","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Power of Latino Leadership, Second Edition, Revised and Updated, 2nd Edition","authors":["Juana Bordas"],"pages":"304","publication_date":"March 2023","description":"This updated and expanded edition is the first and only book to offer a leadership model firmly based on the Latino experience and culture.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781626562578","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Trust and Betrayal in the Workplace, 3rd Edition","authors":["Dennis Reina","Michelle Reina"],"pages":"224","publication_date":"February 2015","description":"Trust is a non-negotiable for high performing relationships and organizations.

Interactive large group meetings form the foundation for this approach, enabling hundreds and even thousands of people to collaborate in crafting their collective future. Change happens faster because the total organization is the \"in group\" that decides which changes are needed; and the actions people throughout the organization take on a daily basis are aligned behind an overall strategic direction that they helped create.Complete with conceptual frameworks, tools and techniques, agendas, and roles key actors need to play, this is the first book published on this powerful approach to organizational change.The process Robert Jacobs details has proven effective in diverse settings, ranging from business and industry to health care, education, government, non-profit agencies, and communities.Real Time Strategic Change demonstrates the flexibility and power of this approach in stories from such diverse organizations as Marriott Hotels, Ford Motor Company, Kaiser Permanente, First Nationwide Bank, United Airlines, and a group of 18 school districts.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Strategic Thinking"]},{"id":"9781292342627","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Everyone Included","authors":["Helen May"],"pages":"250","publication_date":"December 2021","description":"Diversity and inclusion (D&I) isn't just an HR exercise – it can make a real different to your team performance too.

Traditionally, older workers would retire and make room for the next generation; instead, Baby Boomers are now prolonging their time in the workplace, yet the successive generations are still coming in. Senior leaders are now left to manage a blended workplace comprised of up to four generations—each with their own ideas of work ethic, work/life balance, long-term career goals, and much more. Management is challenging at the best of times, but the new prevalence of generation gaps—sometimes even layered—add an entirely new dimension to an already complex responsibility. This book presents case studies and interviews with representatives of companies with age-diverse workforces, detailing innovative strategies for smoothing out the bumps and helping everyone work together.\n\nManagers have long wished that their positions came with an instruction manual, and this book delivers with a host of effective inter-generational management strategies illustrated by real-world companies.\n\nManage the multi-generation workplace more effectively\nNavigate the generational culture clash\nAdopt proven strategies for helping everyone get along\nPromote a more positive culture amidst clashing expectations\n\nEvery generation in the workplace has value, each has their own strengths, their own weaknesses, and their own unique talents. Each is indispensable, and when they come together as a synergistic force, they can be unstoppable.

Whether you are a coach, a business leader, a civic activist, a teacher, a counselor, or a parent, this book will offer you a powerful, highly effective way to connect to the people you care about and move them forward toward their best selves. In sports, coaches have developed ways of connecting with their players quickly in the \"heat of the battle,\" inspiring them to perform to their fullest potential and \"leave it all on the field.\" Interestingly, although these techniques have not been codified, great coaches have independently developed remarkably similar models. This book aligns these techniques and distills their essence into a fundamental skill set that anyone can use to connect with, support, and inspire his or her colleagues, teammates, friends, and family members. At its foundation, great coaching is based on a solid set of techniques that can be applied to all areas of life. Essentially, those skills boil down to forging authentic connections, providing genuine support, and offering concise direction.\n\nWhile our everyday pressures may be less intense than those of a championship, the long-term game is even more important. Why not borrow from the best to develop the skills and abilities to win every day?\n\nInspire and motivate people to higher performance\nImprove communication in high-stakes situations\nBe more effective both professionally and socially\n\nGetting inside the way great coaching works gives you an unparalleled glimpse at the core of inspiration.

Think of the impact this would have on recruitment, retention, customer satisfaction, innovation, and overall performance. Aron Ain, the award-winning CEO of Kronos, a global provider of workforce management and human capital management cloud solutions, believes that anything is possible when people are inspired. By embracing employee development and engagement as a growth strategy, Ain transformed his company’s culture and built a billion-dollar business.

Yet many executives and managers find that they have become leaders by default rather than as a result of a personal choice. In fact, a great many people drift into or away from being leaders simply because they have not done the work of matching their own honestly described self with the realities of the leadership role. Not until they are well into their careers do many individuals seriously explore their personal fit for leadership. But by then, it is often too late to prepare for more gratifying roles or to get out of situations that don't make sense for them as individuals.\n\nDiscovering the Leader in You offers a planful approach to understanding how aspects of personality, character, vision, home life, values, and skills match with essential leadership activities. This unique system of self-discovery clearly shows what it looks like to fit or not to fit in leadership roles in organizations.\n\nRobert J. Lee and Sara N. King, who developed this approach from their experience at the widely renowned Center for Creative Leadership in Greensboro, North Carolina, help leaders and potential leaders examine leadership commitments and development paths in the context of who they are as individuals. They show how to connect the inner self to the demands of leadership by using a set of questions that help (1) clarify the relevant realities and expectations in a leadership role, (2) bring out a personal vision and a leadership vision, (3) base leadership behaviors on personal values, (4) become more authentic in leadership situations, and (5) productively integrate work and personal lives.\n\nDiscovering the Leader in You will help all executives--seasoned veterans and those considering leading as a new direction in their careers--to gain more personal insight into what leadership really means to them, to retain more control over their career choices, and consequently to achieve more personal success as leaders.\n\n\"In the considerable literature on leadership, this book focuses on something new-how individuals can identify the key attributes of great leadership and link them to their own unique vision, values, and personal strengths.

Dr. Robert Rodriguez and Andrés T. Tapia call this low percentage of Latino and Latina corporate executives today the “5 percent Shame.” Inspired by Price M. Cobbs's seminal work on the secrets of successful Black leaders, this book seeks to understand the impact on Latinos and Latinas of the external forces of conscious and unconscious biases and of the internal forces of whether to assimilate or double down on their cultural identities in their quest to get ahead. The second edition features a new foreword by Henry Cisneros, former secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, as well as updated statistics and graphs to represent how America's career landscape for Latinos has and has not changed and how to ensure Latinos can rise to their fullest potential.Using insights from in-depth interviews with twenty highly successful boomer Latino and Latina executives and focus groups with dozens of Gen X and millennial leaders, the authors have captured lessons about how these individuals chose their career paths, addressed challenges, and seized opportunities. The discussions are interpreted through the lenses of the authors' different personal experiences as Latino leaders in corporate America and synthesized as a guide for future leaders.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Culture in Business"]},{"id":"9781482245271","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Innovative Lean Machine","authors":["Anthony Sgroi Jr."],"pages":"264","publication_date":"September 2014","description":"In order for an organization to thrive in a competitive business environment, its strategy, people, and branding must be fully optimized.

When Hot Spots arise in and between companies, they provide energy for exploiting and applying knowledge that is already known and genuinely exploring what was previously unknown. Hot Spots are marvelous creators of value for organizations and wonderful, life-enhancing phenomena for each of us. Lynda Gratton has spent more than ten years investigating Hot Spots—discovering how they emerge and how organizations can create environments where they will proliferate and thrive. She has studied dozens of companies and talked to hundreds of employees, managers, and executives in the US, Europe, and Asia. She has asked the important questions: Why and when do Hot Spots emerge? What is it about certain groups of people that support the emergence of Hot Spots? What role do leaders play? She's discovered a host of elements that together contribute to the emergence of Hot Spots—creating energy and excitement, and supporting and channeling that energy into productive outcomes. In this groundbreaking book, Gratton describes four crucial qualities that an organizational culture must have to support the emergence of Hot Spots, looks at what leaders can do to encourage them, and offers activities and tools you can use in your own company to increase the probability of them arising.

Snider and his colleagues lay the groundwork for achieving leadership success in any business. Snider's assertion is this: In leadership, moral character comes first. Without it, skills, competence, and even vision are useless. Here are just a few of the leadership axioms from the \"Cadet Prayer\":\n\nStrengthen and increase our admiration for honest dealing and clean thinking\nMake us to choose the harder right instead of the easier wrong\nEndow us with courage that is born of loyalty to all that is noble and worthy\nGuard us against flippancy and irreverence in the sacred things of life\nGrant us new ties of friendship and new opportunities of service\n\nHonesty. Transparency. Loyalty. Service. These aren't \"soft\" traits. The're the nuts and bolts of quality leadership. They're the hallmark of authentic leadership for the sake of it. And they are the rock-solid foundation on which stand leadership success and all that comes with it.\n\n\"In leadership,\" Snider writes, \"being precedes doing.\" This timeless truth is the first step toward leadership excellence in any walk of life. The Warrior's Character will take you the rest of the way.\n\nWest Point's nondenominational \"Cadet Prayer\" has instilled the values of moral leadership in its cadets for nearly 100 years. In The Warrior's Character, Retired U.S. Army Colonel Don Snider and his colleagues provide a look into West Point’s development of leaders of character through the moral precepts found in the prayer and the Army's seven primary, timeless values:\n\nLOYALTY * DUTY * RESPECT * SERVICE * HONOR * INTEGRITY * COURAGE\n\nAll added up, they form the foundation on which great leadership is built—in the military, in business, in life.

Storytelling is a powerful business tool, and this book shows how to find your own stories and dig deep to learn what's driving your leadership and motivating your diverse workforce. You'll successfully navigate the uncertain terrain brought about by mixed generational expectations, evolving technology, and a rapidly shifting culture as you learn to respond and adapt to become a more effective leader.\n\nCommunication is everything, and leaders are expected to be \"on message\" at all times. Today's workers want to know the \"why\" behind the \"what\", and this guide shows you how to tailor your message and your entire communication style to have the biggest impact.\n\nCut through the \"boring\" and \"bull\" and be real\n\nCommunicate with impact across all platforms\n\nIgnite your teams, your customers, and yourself\n\nLevel up, step out, and discover what you stand for\n\nThe rapid rise of technology and social media has resulted in \"information fatigue\", and most leaders respond by communicating in logic and data. This approach has little impact on the shifting workforce demographics, and each new generation brings higher expectations from their employers and leaders. Ignite shows you how to exceed those expectations and become the authentic leader that drives today's business success.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9780132542524","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"The Heart of Leadership: Motivating Others","authors":["Russell E.

Countless business authors and analysts have assured us that great leadership demands great character. Time and again, we’ve seen that truth play out, as once-thriving organizations falter and fail under the guidance of leaders behaving badly. Why, then, do so many executives remain skeptical about the true value of leadership character? A winning strategy and a sound business model are what really matter, they argue; character is just the icing on the cake.What’s been missing from this debate is hard evidence: data that shows not only that leadership character matters for organizational success, but how it matters; and concrete evidence that it leads to better business results. Now, in this groundbreaking book, respected leadership researcher, adviser, and author Fred Kiel offers that evidencesolid data that demonstrates the connection between character, leadership excellence, and organizational results.After seven years of rigorous research based on a landmark study of more than 100 CEOs and over 8,000 of their employees’ observations, Kiel’s findings show that leaders of strong character achieved up to five times the ROA for their organizations as did leaders of weak character.Return on Character goes on to reveal: How leadership character is formed, how it creates value, and how that value spreads throughout the organization How low-character leaders undermine the success of even the best business plans How leaders at any level can develop the habits of strong character and unlearn” the habits of poor characterThe book also provides a character-building methodologystep-by-step advice and techniques for assessing your own character habits and improving your performance and that of your organization.Return on Character provides the blueprint for building your own leadership character and creating a character-driven organization that achieves superior business results.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781000366587","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Gear-Shifting Leadership","authors":["Leon Cai"],"pages":"200","publication_date":"March 2021","description":"Drawn from his experience as the executive dean of Wilner Sales and Leadership Institute, Leon Cai shares his proven philosophy and methods for improving leadership skills among middle and high-level managers.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781420074185","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Leadership in Chaordic Organizations","authors":["Beverly G.

Leading When You’re Not the Boss provides a conceptual framework that you can apply when assessing your own organizations and work. The book discusses the underlying ideas necessary for a shift from a culture of hierarchies to one of relationships and the establishment of intrapreneurial and holistic work environments.\n\nThis book supports the trend in many corporations toward flattening parts of their traditional top–down hierarchical management systems into more egalitarian, democratized, and distributed organizational forms. It analyzes the weaknesses of \"\"management\"\" culture at a time of ever more rapid change and complexity in the business world and illustrates how flattened organizational units increase agility, innovation, and efficacy. Moreover, it discusses how individuals can exercise effective leadership despite lacking the command-and-control authority of conventional bosses and ways for organizations to cultivate effective \"\"post-management\"\" cultures.\n\nEspecially in the technology sector, large projects have become too complex to be mastered by any single leader. Drawing on his experience as a senior manager and executive consultant for a number of Fortune Global 500 companies, Roger Strathausen analyzes the situations and benefits that motivate companies to adopt flattened organizational forms. He shows that empowering a multi-talented group to manage itself by horizontal cooperation can deliver products with more speed, efficiency, innovation, and nimbleness than a solo boss could, while yielding higher employee productivity and retention rates.\n\nWith an entertaining mix of real-world examples and an episodic HBR-style fictitious case study, the author illustrates throughout the book how his leadership lessons can be serviceable only when intelligently tailored to the dynamic complexities of specific situations, including the personalities and competencies of the people involved.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management"]},{"id":"9781633693012","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"HBR's 10 Must Reads Leadership Collection (4 Books) (HBR's 10 Must Reads)","authors":["Harvard Business Review","Daniel Goleman","Peter F.

Toyota veterans reveal how to build continuous improvement into your company’s DNA\n\nEver since Toyota introduced the revolutionary Toyota Production System (TPS), businesses have tried to replicate Toyota’s success. Few have succeeded over the long term. What businesses have failed to realize is that TPS calls for a fundamentally different way of thinking.\n\nNow, at long last, here is a straightforward guide that make sense of the thinking culture behind Toyota’s phenomenal success. In its pages, authors Tracey and Ernie Richardson speak from the heart as Toyota employees who worked in the Kentucky factory when the company was first introducing its people-first approach in the U.S., and went on in the ensuing decades to teach Lean thinking around the world.\n\nIn The Toyota Engagement Equation, the authors take you through Toyota’s own journey of discovery. This deep dive into the company’s game-changing work practices reveals how employees were developed, how they were taught to spot and define problems through standardization, how they were coached to solve them, and how they were encouraged to improve their thinking as they moved forward.\n\nAnd you’ll see how Toyota developed this simple but profoundly effective approach into an overall management system—and how you can achieve amazing results in your company through the same system.\n\nIn the world of Lean design and implementation handbooks, The Toyota Engagement Equation stands out as a fresh, unique, and authoritative guide to building your business into the Toyota of your industry.

The rules and norms have changed—and so must leadership.\n\nAnd yet, coercive bureaucracy, hierarchy, and control—old ways of thinking and working—are still with us, a deep-seated and powerful legacy. We are living through a profound transition from an old, industrial era to a new one that is digital, transparent, and complex.\n\nIn this important new book by former dean of Harvard Business School Kim Clark, written with his business school professor son, Jonathan, and management consultant daughter, Erin, the dynamic struggle between two competing paradigms of leadership is compellingly illustrated: an old paradigm that involves control and power over people versus a new one that enables and inspires power through people.\n\nWith rich examples and stories, the authors show how deeply ingrained the legacy model of leadership remains and how destructive it is, causing waste and loss of human potential, stifling innovation, and ultimately resulting in what the authors call \"organizational darkness.\" They go on to articulate a new, positive model, one that consciously seeks to do good and to make things better; that cares for people, helping them to thrive; and that mobilizes people to solve tough problems. These three elements, they argue, are the soul, heart, and mind of leadership, and activating them requires careful attention to both the personal and the organizational dimensions of leadership.\n\nThe narrative is interwoven with probing analysis and reflection, and the authors speak clearly and frankly about the moral aspects and impact of leadership. They also provide a concrete frame and approach for scaling the new model and creating a vibrant leadership system.\n\nLeading Through is a deep and essential account of the evolution of our leadership thinking and practice that is both timely and timeless.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9783111511382","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Executive Fashion","authors":["Emre Ozsoz"],"pages":"101","publication_date":"February 2025","description":"Chief Executive Officer (CEO) salaries are a topic of interest among the public and academics in the US as well as the world over.

Bell"],"pages":"9","publication_date":"October 2014","description":"Customers are increasingly “omnichannel” — deploying both online and offline channels — in their thinking and behavior. In order to win in this new environment, sellers also must be omnichannel. That means having explicit strategies for the two core channel functions — provision of information about products and product fulfillment — and offering the right combination of experiences for their customers. The authors have developed a customer-focused framework for delivering these strategies, drawing on empirical research conducted with both offline-first retailers like Crate & Barrel and online first retailers like Warby Parker.Traditional, or offline-first, retailers need to leverage the online channel not only for fulfillment but also as a venue for delivering price, inventory and other information desired by customers. Using data from a natural experiment conducted at Crate & Barrel, a retailer of furnishings and housewares, the authors show that by providing accurate price and inventory information online, a traditional retailer can significantly increase sales and traffic to offline stores.Similarly, New York-based Warby Parker, an eyeglasses retailer that started out selling online, sells products with tactile features that some customers want to experience offline. The authors describe how Warby Parker has experienced significant benefits by developing an offline presence. For Warby Parker, offline showrooms that provide product inventory for customers to sample drive increased sales through the online channel. Furthermore, the authors note, when online-first retailers develop offline channels to deliver information, this allows customers to sort more appropriately into the channel that best suits them.The authors argue that the omnichannel strategies they discuss — strategies that balance the customer’s need for quality information and timely fulfillment — are the key to brand building and retail success. This, they say, is true for traditional brick-and-mortar retailers, pure-play Internet retailers and hybrid retailers alike.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Strategic Thinking"]},{"id":"9781119111092","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"5 Voices","authors":["Jeremie Kubicek","Steve Cockram"],"pages":"240","publication_date":"March 2016","description":"Discover your leadership voice and unlock your potential to influence others\n\n5 Voices is the code for unlocking your capacity to have honest conversations and build deeper, more authentic relationships with your teams, your families and your friends.

So she knows a thing or two about conquering obstacles.\n\nIn The Courage to Take Command, Colonel Morgenthaler provides invaluable leadership lessons drawn from her three decades of military service--from her first days in ROTC to combat in some of the world's most dangerous war zones.

Friedman\n\nTechnology is changing work as we know it. Cultural norms are undergoing tectonic shifts. A global pandemic proves that we are inextricably connected whether we choose to be or not. So much change, so quickly, is disorienting. It's undermining our sense of identity and challenging our ability to adapt. But where so many see these changes as threatening, Heather McGowan and Chris Shipley see the opportunity to open the flood gates of human potential—if we can change the way we think about work and leadership. They have dedicated the last 5 years to understanding how technical, business, and cultural shifts affecting the workplace have brought us to this crossroads, The result is a powerful and practical guide to the future of work for leaders and employees. The future can be better, but only if we let go of our attachment to our traditional (and disappearing) ideas about careers, and what a \"good job\" looks like.\n\nBlending wisdom from interviews with hundreds of executives, The Adaptation Advantage explains the profound changes happening in the world of work and posits the solution: new ways to think about careers that detach our sense of pride and personal identity from our job title, and connect it to our sense of purpose. Activating purpose, the authors suggest, will inherently motivate learning, engagement, empowerment, and lead to new forms of pride and identity throughout the workforce. Only when we let go of our rigid career identities can we embrace and appreciate the joys of learning and adapting to new realities—and help our organizations do the same.\n\nOf course, making this transition is hard. It requires leaders who can attract and motivate cognitively diverse teams fueled by a strong sense of purpose in an environment of psychological safety—despite fierce competition and external pressures.   Adapting to the future of work has always called for strong leadership. Now, as a pandemic disrupts so many aspects of work, adapting is a leadership imperative. The Adaptation Advantage is an essential guide to help leaders meet that challenge.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781119954132","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Growth Champions: The Battle for Sustained Innovation Leadership","authors":["The Growth Agenda"],"pages":"344","publication_date":"April 2012","description":"Unique insights and fresh perspectives on business growth and innovation\n\nGrowth is a priority for most businesses, but one that's elusive and difficult to achieve.

Drawing upon a lifetime of humanitarian work in some of the world’s most difficult places, author Linda Cruse shares stories from the frontline that illustrate how to dig deep, inspire, thrive and more. Business leaders work on a different type of frontline — one that is no less volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous — and the ability to deal effectively with the unexpected sets great leaders apart from the herd. Tap into your own intuition, compassion and courage; keep composure under pressure; align vision with strategic goals; exercise mental toughness — these skills are required in the aftermath of a tsunami in Thailand or a landslide in Nepal, and in business, they propel good people to great feats of leadership.\n\nThis book presents extraordinary stories of extraordinary people who confront the best and worst of humanity every day. These people accomplish big things with few resources, prioritise progress over personal comfort and prevail over seemingly impossible odds. Their lessons contain multitudes for those who aspire to be great leaders — and the very best version of themselves. \n\nLearn the secrets of effective leadership through the frontline humanitarian lens\nMaster the art of storytelling to build morale, strengthen teamwork and define problem solving paradigms\nSee everyday situations in a new way, discover new possibilities and unearth new solutions\nLearn how extraordinary people confront fear, face death and find joy in the most difficult circumstances\n\nWhether on the frontline or in the boardroom, the objective is the same: to achieve goals and exceed expectations.

To lead effectively in today’s brave new world, you have to question EVERYTHING.\n\nFor the first time in human history, knowledge is free and almost every boundary to communication has been lifted. This open source world has permanently altered the business landscape. And you can count on the fact that the pace of change will only accelerate. Yet… companies still rely on management tools and practices that were, at best, mildly effective in their heyday.\n\nIn Open Source Leadership, Rajeev Peshawaria reveals the vision, insight, and practices he has used to help some of today’s largest and most influential organizations meet the open source world head on. It all starts with asking the right questions:\n\nWhat’s the most effective leadership style in a world of 24/7 connectivity?\nHow has the very concept of leadership changed in the open source era?\nHow do you inspire and reward performance in the “gig economy?”\nHow do you measure engagement and effectively address the gaps?\nHow can you lead innovation--quickly and continuously?\n\nPeshawaria reveals the answers to these questions--and they will surprise you. Based on his company’s groundbreaking research spanning 28 countries, he concludes that traditional industrial age thinking needs a massive upgrade to successfully navigating the brave new world of business. Open Source Leadership rewrites the rules of management, giving you a unique look at the most common misperceptions, illusions, and downright wrong information you’ve been getting about what works and what doesn’t. It provides a new, counterintuitive model for seizing competitive edge in any industry. Among other issues the book argues convincingly that “positive autocracy” must replace democratic leadership; talent and innovation are abundant not scarce; early identification of high-potentials is counter-productive; and setting employees free to do as little as they want will increase productivity.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management"]},{"id":"9781422144077","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Boards That Lead","authors":["Charan","Carey"],"pages":"224","publication_date":"November 2013","description":"Is your firm’s board creating value—or destroying it?Change is coming. Leadership at the top is being redefined as boards take a more active role in decisions that once belonged solely to the CEO. But for all the advantages of increased board engagement, it can create debilitating questions of authority and dangerous meddling in day-to-day operations. Directors need a new road map—for when to lead, when to partner, and when to stay out of the way.Boardroom veterans Ram Charan, Dennis Carey, and Michael Useem advocate this new governance model—a sharp departure from what has been demanded by governance activists, raters, and regulators—and reveal the emerging practices that are defining shared leadership of directors and executives. Based on personal interviews and the authors’ broad and deep experience working with executives and directors from dozens of the world’s largest firms, including Apple, Boeing, Ford, Infosys, and Lenovo, Boards That Lead tells the inside story behind the successes and pitfalls of this new leadership model and explains how to: • Define the central idea of the company• Ensure that the right CEO is in place and potential successors are identified• Recruit directors who add value• Root out board dysfunction• Select a board leader who deftly bridges the divide between management and the board• Set a high bar on ethics and riskWith a total of eighteen checklists that will transform board directors from monitors to leaders, Charan, Carey, and Useem provide a smart and practical guide for businesspeople everywhere—whether they occupy the boardroom or the C-suite.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9780470345030","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"High Altitude Leadership: What the World's Most Forbidding Peaks Teach Us About Success","authors":["Chris Warner","Don Schmincke"],"pages":"240","publication_date":"October 2008","description":"Leadership is often a risky, lonely role possessing nearly unbearable lows and fleeting highs.

Yet many change initiatives fail. One reason, the authors say, is that leaders often underestimate the impact of the politics and emotions of change. The authors suggest a five-step process for leading a major change initiative:Step 1: Map the political landscape. Map the key external and internal, formal and informal stakeholders who will be affected by the change.Step 2: Identify the key influencers within each stakeholder group. Once the key stakeholder groups are mapped, leaders should identify the key influencers within each group. Key influencers are those individuals who might be able to marshal resources, enroll others, build legitimacy and momentum, and provide ideas crucial to driving the change.Step 3: Assess influencers’ receptiveness to change. People have different levels of receptiveness to a given change. Both supporters and skeptics must be engaged.Step 4: Mobilize influential sponsors and promoters. Sponsors have access to financial and human resources. Promoters, on the other hand, can be extremely useful in igniting the enthusiasm that can draw fence-sitters into the process and propel change forward.Step 5: Engage influential positive and negative skeptics. Skeptics can either make a change process more effective or turn a minor hurdle into a major roadblock. Positive skeptics may offer important perspectives and insights about the vulnerabilities of proposed changes. Influential negative skeptics are also important to work with.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Strategic Thinking"]},{"id":"9781604912586","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Leadership in Action: Spreading the Word: How to Self-Promote with Integrity","authors":["Gina Hernez-Broome","Cindy McLaughlin","Stephanie Trovas"],"pages":"5","publication_date":"February 2007","description":"For leaders and the groups they lead, doing a good job is often not enough to gain the visibility and recognition they deserve.

It illustrates how teachers can both lift people up and let them down. It proposes that the best teachers are also leaders, and the best leaders are also teachers.\n\nIn examining how to lead and teach, renowned Harvard Business School professor Thomas J. DeLong takes the reader inside his own head and heart. He notes that, as teachers, we often focus more on our inadequacies and missteps than on our strengths and unique talents. He explains why this is so by dissecting and analyzing his own experiences--using himself as a case study.\n\nThe book's goal is to help readers learn about the intricacies of teaching and managing, and to impart lessons about how teachers can create a unique teaching atmosphere. To do this, the author analyzes the process of creating a curriculum, preparing for an eighty-minute class, managing the fifteen minutes before class begins, and evaluating the nature of the teaching experience after the session concludes.\n\nAlong the way, he connects specific classroom behaviors with leadership issues--in organizations, in teams, and in personal relationships. He also asks--and answers--some provocative questions, such as:\n\nWhat happens on multiple levels when I teach or lead--with me, students, or professionals?\nWhat am I thinking and feeling as I process what students are thinking and feeling?\nHow are my internal conversations affecting how I teach and lead?\nHow do I manage my biases, including having \"favorite\" students?\nTo what extent can I use teaching methods in the arena of management?\n\nThroughout Teaching by Heart, DeLong discusses why empathy and authenticity matter. When teachers embrace this mindset, students have the opportunity to have a unique learning experience. Teachers and managers will learn how to create moments of transformation for students.\n\nWhether you're a university professor, a student, a business leader, or just someone fascinated by teaching, this book will instruct, entertain, and--hopefully--inspire.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781599961897","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Creating Organizational Soul: The Source of Positive Change and Transformation","authors":["Richard Bellingham Ed.D."],"pages":"141","publication_date":"January 2009","description":"Does your organization have soul?

Success is measured by what we accomplish together. Our obligation to the people we serve is too important to place politics and partisanship before progress and results.\"\n\nFor the Governor and his longtime associate Steve Kadish, these words are much more than political platitudes.

Congratulations.\"\n\n—Frank Kolhatkar, Retired Chairman and Executive Director of the Global Financial Services Industries Practice, Deloitte\n\n\"This book confronts, head-on, the problems that have beset American, and world, business over the last decade. The authors boldly go to the heart of the problem; to a business culture that has lost sight of fundamentals in pursuit of the illusions of rapid growth and personal gain.

Anyone worried about the future of American business and American corporate culture should read this book.\"\n\n—Morgan Witzel, Editor-in-Chief of Corporate Finance Review and Columnist, The Financial Times\n\n\"The authors have provided a 'must read' autopsy of just about all that's wrong with American business today. It is a 'must read' for investors interested in why we are where we are.\"\n\n—Graef Crystal, Pay Expert and Columnist, Bloomberg News\n\n\"Sayles and Smith make a compelling case that rogue business executives received a lot of help from others: economists, business schools, apologists, a compliant Congress, under funded regulatory agencies, a gullible press, as well as sleazy professional auditors and accountants—all of which contributed to the great market crash of 2000 and the persistent corporate scandals. Seeking unprecedented individual gains, many members of the business community forgot their commitment to personal integrity, which maintains an essential trust among strangers, which binds all members in the larger society.\"\n\n—James Kuhn, Courtney C.

Financial scandals aren't unknown in U.S. business history, but today's growing problem of executive excesses and self-serving behavior is unprecedented in both its persistence and pervasiveness. Executives continue to plunder their companies and rip off their stockholders. This book reveals the true breadth and depth of corporate corruption—including flagrant new cases that haven't received the publicity they deserve. More important, it answers the questions that matter most: Why now? And how can we stop it? The authors identify powerful forces that cut across management, finance, the economy, politics, and even psychology. They identify rarely discussed contributing factors, such as the consulting boom, new technologies used by accounting and auditing professionals, the transformation of business schools, journalism, and the media in general. This book addresses both criminal activity and the not-quite-illegal abuses that are now endemic in the executive suite—abuses that challenge the underpinnings of capitalism.

It is a simple fact of business life that any job, from investment banker to dishwasher, can become miserable.

No one person or group can possibly solve them—they require the broadest possible cooperation. But, says Harvard scholar Dean Williams, our leadership models are still essentially tribal: individuals with formal authority leading in the interest of their own group. In this deeply needed new book, he outlines an approach that enables leaders to transcend internal and external boundaries and help people to collaborate, even people over whom they technically have no power.Drawing on what he's learned from years of working in countries and organizations around the world, Williams shows leaders how to approach the delicate and creative work of boundary spanning, whether those boundaries are cultural, organizational, political, geographic, religious, or structural. Sometimes leaders themselves have to be the ones who cross the boundaries between groups. Other times, a leader's job is to build relational bridges between divided groups or even to completely break down the boundaries that block collaborative problem solving. By thinking about power and authority in a different way, leaders will become genuine change agents, able to heal wounds, resolve conflicts, and bring a fractured world together.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"1882197623","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Preparing for Development: Making the Most of Formal Leadership Programs","authors":["Jennifer Matrineau","Ellie Johnson"],"pages":"30","publication_date":"March 2001","description":"If you are scheduled to participate in a leadership development program, or if you're considering such a program, you can substantially increase the benefits to yourself and to your organization by preparing for the development experience.

Lean Today, Rich Tomorrow: Succeeding in Today's Globalization Chaos tells the story of how an obsolete factory destined for closure was transformed into the most productive North American manufacturer in its field, but this shift didn't happen without its share of obstacles.Despite the problems the company encountered, the implementation of the Lean/TPS with JIT and Kaizen absolutely ensured its survival while many companies in the field fell under the shadow of bankruptcy. The company eliminated the bad habits associated with its antiquated push system, including piecework, batch process, and rework, and transformed its factory into a JIT/Lean philosophy-driven plant with one-piece flow, U-shaped production lines, and productivity sharing.Telling a tale of adventure, the book guides readers through the steps taken by the company to improve processes and results over a ten-year period. This success story will give managers the tools to succeed in rallying and training a workforce to achieve Lean goals through a substantive change in culture. The book keeps the use of theory to a minimum.

The book begins with a basic explanation of the leadership process and how leaders express their vision. It then looks at how leaders can create positive relationships with followers that pay off in effective performance. Next, the book investigates how leaders motivate their followers by creating follower self-efficacy, trust, and valued rewards. Then, the focus changes to the specific types of messages a leader can use to motivate followers. Leading is about change, so the book next looks at ways effective leaders communicate in leading change in organizations and at how the changing workforce is effecting how effective leaders communicate with the new workforce.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781606494820","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Managing Expatriates","authors":["Yvonne McNulty"],"pages":"262","publication_date":"July 2013","description":"Expatriation is a big topic, and is getting bigger. Over 200 million people worldwide now live and work in a country other than their country of origin. Tens of billions of dollars are spent annually by organizations that move expatriates around the world. Yet, despite the substantial costs involved, expatriation frequently results in an unsatisfactory return on investment (ROI), with little or no knowledge as to how to improve it. Why is this so? Drawing on more than a decade of expertise, research, and publications in top journals, the authors provide you real solutions to achieve more than a satisfactory ROI from expatriates—with rule number one being: Understand expatriates themselves. This book provides a practical “insider’s” guide that reveals why expatriates seek and accept international assignments; how they feel impacted by new forms of remuneration and other working conditions; how international assignments fit in with their longer-term career aspirations; and what complications arise in terms of their families. Whether you’re a manager or consultant, inside you’ll learn what modern-day global mobility is like (based on the authors’ decade-long study with nearly four hundred expatriates and their managers, as well as over a hundred who were interviewed personally), how it is changing, and why now, more than ever, a hard-nosed ROI approach is necessary.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management"]},{"id":"9780814409176","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Spiral Up: ... and Other Management Secrets Behind Wildly Successful Initiatives","authors":["Jane C.

Today’s world is multidimensional, multipolar, and multipurpose, and increasingly, classic management challenges such as leadership vs. management; exploitation vs. exploration, virtual vs. physical presence, economic sustainability vs. environmental sustainability, localization vs. globalization, etc. assume the characteristics of paradoxes rather than problems or dilemmas.\n\nLeadership of paradox is not about making a decision once and for all or prioritizing tough trade-offs, but about navigating between opposing considerations. Navigating Leadership Paradox argues that academic knowledge pools can support leaders’ decision-making and sense-making in organizations and navigating paradoxes. The book outlines a practical pathway for management leaders and professionals for steering through paradox using 5 phases, 10 paradoxes, 15 tools, 20 cases, and 25 learning points. It delineates how to identify a paradox by assessing the nature of your challenge and discusses the appropriate courses of action individually as well in collaboration with other stakeholders. It also gives inspiration and advice for professional helpers assisting others in navigating paradox as part of organizational development or other educational purposes.\n\nThis book will be essential reading for practitioners and academicians in the fields of leadership paradox, complexity management, change management, leadership dilemmas and organizational paradox.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Strategic Thinking"]},{"id":"9781118901397","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"View From the Top: An Inside Look at How People in Power See and Shape the World","authors":["M.

It's dealing with people who are too comfortable doing things the way they've always been done and too afraid to do things differently—workers who are, as author Bill Treasurer puts it, too “comfeartable.” Such workers fail to exert themselves any more than they have to, equating “just enough” with good enough. By avoiding even mild challenges, these workers thwart forward progress and make their businesses dangerously safe. To combat this affliction, Treasurer proposes a bold antidote: courage. In Courage Goes to Work, he lays out a comprehensive, step-by-step process that treats courage as a skill that can be developed and strengthened. He Treasurer shows how managers can build workplace courage by modeling courageous behavior themselves, creating an environment where people feel safe taking chances and helping workers deal with fear. To make the concept of courage more concrete, Treasurer identifies what he calls the Three Buckets of Courage: Try Courage, having the guts to take initiative; Trust Courage, being willing to follow the lead of others; and Tell Courage, being honest and assertive with coworkers and bosses. He illustrates each with a variety of vivid real-world examples and offers proven practices for helping your workers keep each bucket full. Aristotle said that courage is the first virtue because it makes all other virtues possible. It's as true in business as it is in life. With more courage, workers gain the necessary confidence to take on harder projects, embrace company changes with more enthusiasm, and extend themselves in ways that will benefit their careers and their company. Courage Goes to Work is the first book to take a systematic approach to developing a vital but overlooked component of business success.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781562867362","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Culture Savvy: Working and Collaborating Across the Globe","authors":["Maureen Rabotin"],"pages":"192","publication_date":"February 2011","description":"Becoming Culture Savvy is the ability to perceive cultural differences, worldviews, and cultural values within an expanded framework - four guiding principles of human interaction.

Adopt servant leadership!In this updated edition of Dare to Serve, former Popeyes CEO Cheryl Bachelder shows that leading by serving is a rigorous and tough-minded approach that yields the best results. When she was named CEO of Popeyes in 2007, the stock price had slipped from $34 in 2002 to $13. The brand was stagnant, the team was discouraged, and the franchisees were just plain angry. Nine years later, restaurant sales were up 45 percent, restaurant profits had doubled, and the stock price was over $61. Servant leadership is sometimes derided as soft or ineffective, but this book confirms that challenging people to reach a daring destination, while treating them with dignity, creates the conditions for superior performance. The second edition of this bestselling book includes Bachelder's post-Popeyes observations and new examples of how you can switch your leadership from self to serve. Ever engaging and inspirational, Bachelder takes you firsthand through the transformation of Popeyes and shows how anyone, at any level can become a Dare-to-Serve leader.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Culture in Business"]},{"id":"01520110029SI","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Issues & Observations: How to Put Your Finger on the High Potentials","authors":["David Berke"],"pages":"4","publication_date":"January 2003","description":"In any organization there are individuals who are considered to be the likely future leaders of the organization—in other words, to have high potential for leadership.

Orr","Dave J.

According to the U.S. government, there were 719,000 consultants in the U.S. in 2010, and you can expect an additional 274,000 by 2020. Cloaked in \"expert\" status, consultants might seem to be the answer to many business problems. You call someone in to solve a particular problem or develop new markets, then send them away once the job is done—while reaping the benefits of their expertise. Consultants sometimes do work miracles, but once in a while they wreck a healthy business. And far too often, the benefits gained by calling in consultants disappear far too soon after they leave.\n\nYet as return on investment (ROI) and accountability for results become bigger and bigger issues, business professionals in search of answers to performance or strategy challenges are turning more and more to outside guidance for help. Indeed, few businesses do not use some kind of consultant at some point in their existence. But how can you leverage the skills consultants can bring to the table without adding undue risk to your operations? How can you effectively manage the consultant relationship to get the greatest benefit for the least cost? What metrics can support your decision to hire—or not hire—a consultant? When should you use home-grown talent to solve problems instead? That's what this book is all about.\n\nWhile there is a multitude of books on how to be a consultant, this is the first to help an executive determine when to hire one. You will learn strategies to decide when a consultant is needed and how to support that decision with hard evidence, how to select the right consultant, how to set clear expectations, and how to know when a consultant is either a valuable resource or a hindrance to the company's success.\n\nThe authors of this book bring together two opposing perspectives. Linda Orr has served as a consultant in many companies and situations, while Dave Orr has hired consultants many times. Together, they can help you make the most strategically and financially sound business decisions. This books shows you how to:\n\nWork through ROI and other issues to support a decision to hire a consultant.\n\nMaximize the benefits consultants can provide.\n\nExplore options other than hiring a consultant.\n\nWhat you'll learn\n\nWhere consultants \"come from\" and what qualifications you should look for.\n\nHow to compute ROI for consultants.\n\nWhen consultants can be effective and when they cannot be effective.\n\nHow to select the right consultant, then set expectations.\n\nHow to negotiate a consulting contract.\n\nHow to form an effective consulting relationship.\n\nHow to fire a consultant who is not adding value.\n\nYour options besides consultants to solve business problems.\n\nWho this book is for\n\nWhen to Hire—or Not Hire—a Consultant: Getting Your Money's Worth from Consulting Relationships is designed for owners and managers who need help navigating the decisions to be made and the choices faced when they need—or think they need—outside help. Most companies use consultants occasionally, but many executives have not had the experience of dealing with consultants and using them profitably and effectively. It's also for those who have had a bad experience with consultants and need a better process for ensuring a successful relationship with a consultant.\n\nA secondary market for this book is MBA students. Giving that the consulting industry is so large, a basic part of strategy training should be when do you \"outsource\" your management decisions.

While hospitals and health systems nationwide have laid people off or are closing their doors, Scripps is financially healthy, has added thousands of employees (even with a no-layoff philosophy), and has developed a reputation as a top employer. What are the secrets to this remarkable story?\n\nIn The Front-Line Leader, Chris Van Gorder candidly shares his own incredible story, from police officer to CEO, and the leadership philosophy that drives all of his decisions and actions: people come first. Van Gorder began his unlikely career as a California police officer, which deeply instilled in him a sense of social responsibility, honesty, and public service. After being injured on the job and taking an early retirement, Van Gorder had to reinvent himself, taking a job as a hospital security director, a job that would change his life. Through hard work and determination, he rose to executive ranks, eventually becoming CEO of Scripps. But he never forgot his own roots and powerful work ethic, or the time when he was a security officer and a CEO would not make eye contact with him.\n\nVan Gorder leads from the front lines, making it a priority to know his employees and customers at every level. His values learned on the force—protecting the community, educating citizens, developing caring relationships, and ultimately doing the right thing—shape his approach to business. As much as companies talk about accountability, managers seldom understand what practical steps to take to achieve an ethic of service that makes accountability meaningful. The Front-Line Leader outlines specific tactics and steps anyone can use starting today to take responsibility, inspire others, and achieve breakout results for their organizations. Van Gorder reveals how a no-layoff philosophy led to higher accountability, how his own attention to seemingly minor details spurred larger change, and how his own high standards for himself and his team improved morale and productivity.\n\nFrom general strategy to the tiny, everyday steps leaders can take to create the kind of culture and accountability that translates into major competitive advantage, The Front-Line Leader charts a path to better leadership and a more engaged, higher-performing organization.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9780470739143","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Coaching Corporate MVPs: Challenging and Developing High-Potential Employees","authors":["Margaret Butteriss"],"pages":"224","publication_date":"May 2008","description":"\"Coaching Corporate MVPs provides a very effective guide for developing this small group of high-impact performers within an organization.

The problems are complex, the politics murky, and the players innumerable. Yet, every day there are regular heroes making a significant impact on our most intractable social issues.\n\n\"Can't Not Do\" is a catchphrase for the urge that captures the heart of effective social change agents—explaining, in their own words, their passion and drive: \"I can't not do this.\" \"It's not that I can do this, it's that I can't not.\" \"I could not imagine not doing something about this issue.\" The surprising truth from the trenches is: we already have numerous proven solutions for our many social challenges; what our world needs most, and what most changes our children's future, are more people prepared and committed to act on their social impulses for the long haul. Innovation helps. Money helps, too. But greater numbers of committed people help the most.\n\nIf you feel an internal, persistent call to do more for the world, Can't Not Do will help you to bridge the gap between \"wanting to do\" and \"doing\"—to access the drive of an effective change agent, to break through self-imposed barriers, to learn key principles for success, and to start seeing yourself acting as a change agent.\n\nThere is no \"secret sauce\" someone is born with and no special club needed to be successful at social change. Rather, successful change agents share some fundamental orientations to the world and to their committed cause and, over time, learn certain lessons that help them become more effective. These lessons are reflected in Can't Not Do in seven seemingly simple questions that provide guideposts and unlock the reader's potential to make a difference for a social cause they care about.\n\nThis isn't a self-help book. It's an inspiring narrative intertwined with a \"street-readiness\" dialogue, between the author and you, between you and your inner aspirations. These are authentic success stories, vital questions, and unconventional answers that can guide and inspire you to realize your greatest potential.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9780137001453","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"The Truth About Motivating Your Employees: The Essential Truths in 20 Minutes","authors":["Martha I.

Building authentic and lasting human relations may be the most important calling for leaders in this century. According to management and global leadership specialist Maya Hu-Chan, the concept of “saving face” can help any leader preserve dignity and create more empathetic cross-cultural relationships. “Face” represents one's self-esteem, self-worth, identity, reputation, status, pride, and dignity. Saving face is often understood as saving someone from embarrassment, but it's also about developing an understanding of the background and motivations of others to discover the unique facets we all possess. Without that understanding, we risk causing others to lose face without even knowing it. Hu-Chan explains saving face through anecdotes and practical tools, such as her BUILD leadership model (Benevolence, Understanding, Interacting, Learning, and Delivery). This book illustrates how we can give face to create positive first impressions, avoid causing others to lose face, and, most importantly, build trust and lasting relationships inside and outside the workplace.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Culture in Business"]},{"id":"9781849284356","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Resilient Thinking: Protecting Organisations in the 21st Century","authors":["Phillip Wood"],"pages":"144","publication_date":"November 2012","description":"Risk analysis and crisis management … Make sure your organisation is prepared!\n\nIt'll never happen to us ...\n\nOr will it?

Books and courses on leadership flood the market as companies search in vain for that one person who can make sense of their rapidly changing environment through assertiveness, charisma, and control. According to noted consultant Harrison Owen, our inability to locate such a person isn't the fault of our leaders, it's the fault of our expectations.In today's world where chaos is \"normal\" and paradoxes can't be resolved, such old-style leaders no longer offer the solution. Today's world requires inspired leadership from all levels of the organization. \"Inspired leadership\" literally means in-spirited leadership, and this book explores the intimate connection between spirit and leadership it implies. It presents the radical notion that spirit is the most important ingredient of any organization and that leadership means opening space for that spirit to show up in powerful and productive ways.The Spirit of Leadership lays out the New Rules of Leadership, rules which surprisingly turnOl organizations have always played by. For the keys to these new rules, the book turns to those who have always successfully operated apart from the levers of formal power and authority-women. Offering lessons from effective female strategies, it reveals the true functions of leadership: to evoke, grow, sustain, comfort, and raise the spirit.Not to be confused with morale building, motivational techniques, or even the current fad of spirituality in business, The Spirit of Leadership digs deeper to show that, at its essence, leadership is our link to deep inner forces. It provides practical steps readers can use to uncover their own capacity for leadership in whatever position they find themselves, and to exercise that capacity both to enhance the performance of their organizations and to find their own fulfillment as complete human beings.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781633698024","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Race, Work, and Leadership","authors":["Laura Morgan Roberts","Anthony J.

James Parker shows why \"doing the right thing\" isn't just naïve \"feel-goodism\": it's the most powerful rule for business success. Parker's stories won't just convince readers: they'll move them.

The result: Southwest's revenue passenger miles for 4Q01 dropped by only 0.5%, and its market cap soon exceeded all its major competitors combined. These pivotal decisions grew naturally from its culture of mutual respect and trust: Parker reveals how that culture developed, offering deeply personal insights into the principles that can make any team, organization or company strong.

Many of the business decisions these companies make tend to be hidden in systems that make poor decisions, or don't make them at all. Further, most systems aren't configured to learn from the past and therefore struggle to keep up with the pace of change. While many organizations believe the answer is to implement newer, \"intelligent\" systems, the fact is that much of today's existing technology has the potential to be \"smart enough\" to make a big difference to an organization's business.\n\nThis digital Short Cut lays out a cry for systems that are smart enough to help companies survive and thrive in the world as it is today. Showing how the neglect of operational decisions prevents effective implementation of strategy and describing the characteristics of effective operational decision-making, the Short Cut establishes the role of operational decisions. The characteristics of the smart enough systems modern business needs are explained, and the absolute requirement for a new approach is outlined.\n\nThis Short Cut is a reproduction of the “Smart Enough Systems Manifesto” and “Why You Need Smart Enough Systems” chapters from the book.\n\nThis Short Cut should be of interest to software and business professionals. In particular, it will be of value to those managing information systems and application development projects in defining the goals they should have in building better systems, and to business owners who are frustrated by their current systems but cannot articulate how or why to change things.\n\nContents\n\nThe “Smart Enough Systems” Manifesto\n\n    Operational Decisions Are Important\n\n    Operational Decisions Can and Should Be Automated\n\n    Taking Control of Decisions is Increasingly a Source of Competitive Advantage\n\nThe Need for Smart Enough Systems\n\n    The Importance of Operational Decisions\n\n          Strategy Drives Decision-making\n\n          Strategy Is Not Static\n\n          Operational Decisions Matter\n\n          Operational Decisions Are Under Pressure\n\n    Operational Decision-Making as a Corporate Asset\n\n          Characteristics of Operational Decisions\n\n          Characteristics of Corporate Assets\n\n    Introducing Smart Enough Systems\n\n          Characteristics of Smart Enough Systems\n\n          Current Approaches Fail\n\n          Decision Management Is Required\n\n    Introducing Smart Enough Logistics","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Strategic Thinking"]},{"id":"9781292112794","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Leadership in the Headlines","authors":["Andrew Hill"],"pages":"208","publication_date":"June 2016","description":"Good leaders walk a tightrope between doing and daring – often in the glare of the public spotlight.

Members of minority groups strive to make their organizations better for others like themselves without limiting their career paths. Socially or environmentally conscious workers seek to act on their values at firms more concerned with profits than global poverty or pollution.\n\nYet many firms leave little room for differences, and people who don't \"fit in\" conclude that their only option is to assimilate or leave. In Rocking the Boat, Debra E. Meyerson presents an inspiring alternative: building diverse, adaptive, family-friendly, and socially responsible workplaces not through revolution but through walking the tightrope between conformity and rebellion.\n\nMeyerson shows how these \"tempered radicals\" work toward transformational ends through incremental means—sticking to their values, asserting their agendas, and provoking change without jeopardizing their hard-won careers. Whether it's by resisting quietly, leveraging \"small wins,\" or mobilizing others in legitimate but powerful ways, tempered radicals turn threats to their identities into opportunities to make a positive difference in their companies—and in the world.\n\nTimely and provocative, Rocking the Boat puts self-realization and change within everyone's reach—whether your difference stems from race, gender, sexual orientation, values, beliefs, or social perspective.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Culture in Business"]},{"id":"9780071784092","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Running the Gauntlet: Essential Business Lessons to Lead, Drive Change, and Grow Profits","authors":["Jeffrey W.

Don’t worry—it’s fine to confess.\n\nIf you have faced a surprise in the training room, chances are Jonathan Halls has seen it, too. As a result, he doesn’t pretend to be a shiny happy trainer anymore; his 25-plus years of training and facilitating in 25 countries have taught him not to stress over a less-than-flawless class—and helped him focus less on himself and more on letting his learners shine.\n\nIn Confessions of a Corporate Trainer: An Insider Tells All, Jonathan tells relatable and charming stories of what corporate training is really about, drawing from his highly rated train-the-trainer workshops and hundreds of honest conversations with like-minded trainers.\n\nHe recounts the curveball he was thrown midway through a change management workshop in Zagreb, Croatia—and how it showed him the futility of overplanning. He shares the time a fire alarm disrupted a training program he led in Washington, D.C., and how he embraced the interruption. And he reflects on what conspires to knock trainers off their game (psst: demanding clients, heavy workloads, and frequent travel are only a few of the culprits).\n\nDiscover the gritty reality of training.

This fact is fundamental to organizations whose leaders must often make crucial decisions: to do this they need the best available insights.In Judgment Calls, authors Tom Davenport and Brook Manville share twelve stories of organizations that have successfully tapped their data assets, diverse perspectives, and deep knowledge to build an organizational decision-making capabilitya competence they say can make the difference between success and failure. This book introduces a model that taps the collective judgment of an organization so that the right decisions are made, and the entire organization profits.Through the stories in Judgment Calls, the authorsboth of them seasoned management thinkers and advisersmake the case for the wisdom of organizations and suggest ways to use it to best advantage. Each chapter tells a unique story of one dilemma and its ultimate resolution, bringing into high relief one key to the power of collective judgment. Individually, these stories inspire and instruct; together, they form a model for building an organizational capacity for broadly based, knowledge-intensive decision making.

While Lean was first applied in manufacturing, arguably evolving out of the Toyota Production System, it is now applied widely to service and administrative processes as well. Lean, in comparison with other business improvement processes such as Six Sigma, relies on intuitive concepts rather than complex mathematics. Thus, a short, non-technical, understandable, and engaging text can successfully convey the essential principles of Lean and empower the reader. Besides describing the concepts of Lean, plentiful examples and brief case studies illustrate the application of Lean in different contexts including manufacturing, healthcare, food service, administrative processes, distribution, and retail. Besides giving a clear idea of how to apply Lean in various contexts, the examples illustrate which Lean tools are most appropriate in the various contexts. This book focuses on \"how\" to do Lean in terms of what the Lean tools are and how to apply them. What this book is not is an in-depth coverage of other organizational issues associated with the successful implementation of Lean. Because these issues are important, very brief coverage is included in the Section/Chapter entitled \"Other Considerations in Lean.\" Each subsection in this chapter would be extremely brief and would outline the relevant issues, but in no way would thoroughly discuss these topics. References would be included here for those readers who wish to pursue future study in this area.","tags":["Business","Project & Product Management","Product Management","Lean"]},{"id":"9781422166482","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Reinventing the CFO: How Financial Managers Can Transform Their Roles And Add Greater Value","authors":["Jeremy Hope"],"pages":"272","publication_date":"March 2006","description":"On the heels of a decade of scandals and the new pressures brought on by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, corporations expect far more from their CFOs than simply managing the numbers. They expect decision-making support and performance insights that can improve bottom-line results. Unfortunately, the complexity and detail inherent in CFOs’ jobs keep them shackled to budgeting and transaction-processing systems that leave little time for value-adding activities. Jeremy Hope says it’s time to redefine the role of CFOs in today’s organizations, liberating them from ineffective number-crunching responsibilities and enabling them to focus on helping managers improve performance. Grounded in extensive research, Reinventing the CFO outlines seven critical roles—from streamlining redundant processes to regulating risk to identifying a few key measures—that CFOs must take on in order to successfully transform the finance operation.Challenging many of the finance field’s accepted practices and systems, this bold book revolutionizes the role of financial managers and frees them to make smart, ethical, strategic decisions that add real value to the firm.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781949991956","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"On All Cylinders, Second Edition, 2nd Edition","authors":["Ron Robinson"],"pages":"158","publication_date":"October 2019","description":"This book will help any leadership team use their talents to nimbly respond to shifting demands and create a better future for their business and their communities by transitioning from traditional management structures to a system of leadership behaviors.\n\nThe attacks of 9/11 and The Great Recession created a new economy: the new normal.

The intent is to demonstrate a model framework consisting of four critical components: leadership, culture, team and tools. The development of the model and these four components will be built from empirical theories reported in the research literature and in successful applications. This framework will offer a path to develop lean leaders with practical, actionable guidelines. The model framework is suited to broad applications offering practical guidelines for manufacturing and service environments alike. The lean model will develop each of these four components, explaining their relevance and importance for guiding internal lean initiatives. In developing the model, the text will chronicle the historical development of lean noting the significant lean contributions, contributors, and dates of these contributions. This development will trace contributions to the practice of lean back hundreds of years, prior to the contributions of Henry Ford and the contributors from the Toyota system in the 1950's. The future of Lean will also be examined with the current topic of sustainability and how it has extended lean concepts with an external focus towards product life cycle concerns and social issues. This offering is different from competing offerings in three fundamental ways. First, it offers and develops of a comprehensive lean model based on a sound framework. Second, it examines a comprehensive timeline of significant lean contributions and their contributors.

In order to be a market leader or indeed even to survive in many cases, resources must be devoted to longer-term strategic quality activities to address radical--possibly paradigm-shifting-- improvements that might affect the organization and its competitive position. These radical improvements might result from R&D efforts within the organization (proactive) that propel the organization and its products and services to the cutting edge of the markets in which they operate. Or these radical improvements might be developed by competitors or even by organizations in other industries (reactive) which, if ignored, might threaten the long-term survival of the organization if they are not recognized and reacted to in an appropriate way. This book is about how to think differently about quality and by doing so increase the creativity, innovation, and agility of an organization and its employees as well as the awareness of new developments in the marketplace and their possible impact on the organization and its markets. Quality must be addressed in strategic as well as operational terms in order for organizations to compete effectively over the long term. Strategic quality management requires insightful leadership. This book is about attaining the insight required to increase organizational creativity, innovation, and agility to create new paradigms, and survive paradigm shifts that originate outside the organization. Each chapter contains short cases illustrations about real organizations that illustrate the main points of that chapter. This book does not describe a detailed process that ostensibly leads to insight. Rather this book takes the position that what works for one organization might not work as effectively for another. It challenges leaders and managers to adopt a new way of thinking and presents thought-provoking ideas about how organizations can begin the process of charting their own paths to insight--and lasting success.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781952538315","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Lean Thinking for Emerging Healthcare Leaders","authors":["Arnout Orelio"],"pages":"162","publication_date":"September 2020","description":"Lean Thinking for Emerging Healthcare Leaders: How to Develop Yourself and Implement Process Improvements aims to solve the issues in modern day healthcare by handing over the reins of the improvement process to healthcare professionals.

And leaders must go a step further to create what Badaracco calls the good struggle” in order to meet their goals at work, as well as their goals in life.The Good Struggle helps you meet the relentless challenges of being a leader today by identifying the most important questions you should be asking yourself. New answers to these questions can be found by watching leaders in dynamic settings, especially entrepreneurs.

Some level of proficiency can be demonstrated by simply focusing on leading others. But to achieve transformational results, leading self is essential. Cultivating self-awareness and developing a life plan are key elements of leading self. And really, should not leaders demonstrate a level of self-mastery before leading others? It is time that leaders move to a deeper understanding of themselves as they operate within a world of accelerated change and increasing complexity. Although leadership performance is evidenced in outward results, decisions, and actions, the genesis of the leadership performance is an internal endeavor. Resiliency and ethical behavior are grounded by having a strong sense of purpose, established vision, and clear operating values. To the degree that the leader is consciously leading self, the quality of his or her leadership corresponds. Be it for good or evil, conscious leadership is powerful. This book makes plain the case for enhanced self-awareness, provides case studies and research support, presents the voices of several master leadership coaches, and most importantly…leads the reader through the life planning process.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781631575570","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"On all Cylinders","authors":["Ron Robinson"],"pages":"140","publication_date":"August 2016","description":"The attacks of 9/11 and The Great Recession affected us all and created a new economy in the process: the New Normal. The result has been greater demands for management to unleash the power within diverse workforces and rapidly respond to market and technology changes. Most small and mid-sized businesses that survived the Great Recession offer limited management training. Entrepreneurs are so busy that any leadership development is through the Graduate School of Hard Knocks. I continually hear business owners and management express frustration with their ability to accomplish goals with their personnel who seem apathetic about their businesses. This book will help any leadership team use their talents to nimbly respond to shifting demands and create a better future for their business and their communities by transitioning from traditional management structures to a system of leadership behaviors. The components of that system include aligning your workforce, communicating rapidly and effectively throughout your organization, emphasizing ethical behavior, collaborating with clients and associates, and making informed decisions to improve operations and implement changes, motivating to develop an inclusive and high-performing workplace and innovation of new products and services that expand market positions and respond to market changes. These elements can make or break a business in this 21st-century New Normal economy.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Culture in Business"]},{"id":"9780240804163","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Videoconferencing for the Real World","authors":["John Rhodes"],"pages":"260","publication_date":"April 2001","description":"\"John Rhodes' Videoconferencing for the Real World, is a one of the world's most comprehensive blueprints on the awesome power of videoconferencing.\"\nFrom the Foreword by Brad Caldwell\nChairman ICIA and President of\nIntegrated Media Services, Anaheim, CA\n\nDesigned to be useful to both technical and non-technical managers, Video-Conferencing for the Real World demystifies the subject of video communications.
