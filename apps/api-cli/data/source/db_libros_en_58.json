McDowall"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"February 2019","description":"Implement successful and cost-effective enterprise architecture projects. This book provides a new approach to developing enterprise architecture based on the idea of emergent behaviors—where instead of micromanaging system implementation, the enterprise architecture effort establishes clear goals and leaves the details to the implementation teams. System development efforts are measured based on their contribution to achieving business goals instead of implementing specific (possibly outdated) requirements.\n\nMost enterprise architecture initiatives employ one of the existing system architecture frameworks such as Zachman or The Open Group Architecture Framework, but these are not well-suited for enterprise architecture in a modern, agile organization. The new approach presented in this book is based on the author’s experience with large enterprise architecture efforts. The approach leverages research into complex adaptive systems and emergent behaviors, where afew simple rules result in complex and efficient enterprise behaviors.\n\nSimplifying the task of establishing and maintaining the enterprise architecture cuts the costs of building and maintaining the architecture and frees up those resources for more productive pursuits. System implementers are given the freedom to rapidly adapt to changing user needs without the blessing of the enterprise modeling priesthood, and the architecture is transformed from a static pile of obscure models and documents into an operational framework that can be actively used to manage an enterprise’s resources to better achieve business goals. The enterprise architect is free to stop focusing on building and maintaining models and start focusing on achieving business goals.\n\n \n\nWhat You’ll Learn\n\nRefocus enterprise architecture on business needs by eliminating most of the enterprise-level models\nDelegate tasks to the development teams who do system implementation\nDocument business goals, establish strategies for achieving those goals, and measure progress toward those goals\nMeasure the results and gauge whether the enterprise architecture is achieving its goals\nUtilize appropriate modeling techniques that can be effectively used in an enterprise architecture\n\nWho This Book Is For\n\nArchitecture practitioners and architecture managers: Practitioners are experienced architects who have used existing frameworks such as Zachman, and have experience with formal architecture modeling and/or model-based system engineering; managers are responsible for managing an enterprise architecture project and either have experience with enterprise architecture projects that were ineffective or are looking for a different approach that will be more cost-effective and allow for more organizational agility. Government program managers looking for a differentapproach to make enterprise architecture more relevant and easier to implement will also find this book of value.","tags":["Software Development","Software Architecture","Enterprise Architecture"]},{"id":"9781484209950","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Sudoku Programming with C","authors":["Giulio Zambon"],"pages":"300","publication_date":"March 2015","description":"Sudoku Programming with C teaches you how to write computer programs to solve and generate Sudoku puzzles. This is a practical book that will provide you with everything you need to write your own books of Sudoku Classic and Samurai puzzles. But be warned: after reading it, you'll discover that the puzzles in your local paper are not so challenging after all!\n\nWe like Sudokus because they test our capacity to recognize and interpret patterns. But how are the clues generated? Where do those quasi-symmetrical configurations come from? When the author explored the Web to find out, he discovered that there were many sites that explained how to solve Sudokus, but none that told him how create them. He also saw many sites and apps to play Sudoku, but, perhaps not surprising, no indication of how they worked.\n\nSo, he had to develop his own applications in order to find out. And, from the very start, he decided that he would publish the code for anyone else to use and perhaps tinker with, but the author wrote it in such a way that also lets readers with limited knowledge of programming techniques understand it. In fact, you could decide to start generating thousands of puzzles almost immediately, and go through the explanations of algorithms and techniques later, a bit at a time. The author chose to write the application in ‘plain old C’ because he wanted to make the code accessible to as many people as possible.\n\nIn this book, you will find an explanation of all solving strategies, and the code to implement them. Writing the Solver application was more difficult than writing the Generator, because it required designing and implementing each strategy separately. However, the author wanted to include a solving program capable of listing the strategies necessary to solve any particular puzzle. He also wanted to check whether a puzzle was solvable analytically, without any guessing.\n\nThis book includes the full listings of both the Generator and the Solver, and explanations of all C modules, with walk-throughs and examples.","tags":["Software Development","Computer Science","Algorithms"]},{"id":"9798868803215","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Lean-Agile Dilemma: Product Management Inside a Chunky Corporate","authors":["Katie Tamblin"],"pages":"259","publication_date":"June 2024","description":"Over the last decade, Lean-Agile principles have become the standard methodology by which product and technology teams operate.

This workbook is a companion to Use Case Driven Object Modeling with UML. It bridges the gap between the theory presented in the main book and the practical issues involved in the development of an Internet e-commerce application.\n\nUniquely conceived as a workbook and featuring as a running example an e-commerce system for an online bookstore, Applying Use Case Driven Object Modeling with UML examines design in detail, demonstrating the most common design mistakes and the correct design solutions. The hands-on exercises allow you to detect, identify, and correct critical errors on your own, before reviewing the solutions provided in the book.\n\nStructured around the proven ICONIX Process, this workbook presents a streamlined approach to UML modeling designed to avoid analysis paralysis without skipping analysis and design. The book presents the four key phases of this minimalist approach to use case driven design--domain modeling, use case modeling, robustness analysis, and sequence diagramming--and for each topic provides an overview, detailed discussion, list of common mistakes, and a set of exercises for honing object modeling and design skills.\n\nThe three chapters on reviews are also unique. The authors devote a chapter each to requirements review, preliminary design review, and critical design review. This focus on \"designing quality in\" by teaching how to review UML models fills a major gap in the published literature.\n\nThrough examples, Applying Use Case Driven Object Modeling with UML shows you how to avoid more than seventy specific design errors, as illustrated by the \"Top 10\" error lists included as a handy key on the inside covers and within each chapter.

These include a cryptographic cipher that protects the secrecy of your data; cryptographic certificates, which prove identity (authentication); and digital signatures, which ensure your data has not been damaged or tampered with.This book covers cryptographic programming in Java. Java 1.1 and Java 1.2 provide extensive support for cryptography with an elegant architecture, the Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA). Another set of classes, the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE), provides additional cryptographic functionality. This book covers the JCA and the JCE from top to bottom, describing the use of the cryptographic classes as well as their innards.The book is designed for moderately experienced Java programmers who want to learn how to build cryptography into their applications. No prior knowledge of cryptography is assumed. The book is peppered with useful examples, ranging from simple demonstrations in the first chapter to full-blown applications in later chapters.Topics include:\n\nThe Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA)\nThe Java Cryptography Extension (JCE)\nCryptographic providers\nThe Sun key management tools\nMessage digests, digital signatures, and certificates (X509v3)\nBlock and stream ciphers\nImplementations of the ElGamal signature and cipher algorithms\nA network talk application that encrypts all data sent over the network\nAn email application that encrypts its messages\nCovers JDK 1.2 and JCE 1.2.","tags":["Software Development","Programming Languages","JVM Languages","Java"]},{"id":"9780596802035","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Managing RAID on Linux","authors":["Derek Vadala"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"December 2002","description":"Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID) technology is becoming a standard feature of computer systems that support mission-critical services like file sharing, mail exchange, or Web servers. RAID offers two benefits to these essential systems: improved I/O performance and fail-safe data storage.Although bandwidth problems on networks are well documented, the internal data transfer bottleneck that exists at the hardware level in each system can also leave you with perplexing performance issues. RAID is a cost-effective and easy-to-manage way to alleviate this bandwidth problem by distributing the I/O load seamlessly across multiple disks and controllers.RAID also provides uninterrupted data access through disk mirroring and parity algorithms. That means systems can remain online even during a disk or controller failure. RAID is scalable, making it robust enough for large, high-traffic sites and small, critical systems. By using RAID, system administrators can combine single disks into terabytes worth of data storage.Managing RAID on Linux covers everything system administrators need to know to put together a system that can support RAID. You will learn about the different types of RAID, along with associated technologies and issues, and how to choose the best RAID system for your needs. With a step-by-step, hands-on approach, the author guides you through the installation of either Linux software RAID or a hardware RAID card. The book shows how to build an array and optionally install a high-performance file system. Contents include:\n\nAn introduction to RAID and Linux\nPlanning and architecture of your RAID system\nBuilding a software RAID\nSoftware RAID tools and references\nBuilding a hardware RAID\nPerformance and tuning of your RAID system\nRAID has become the low-cost solution of choice to deal with the ever-increasing demand for data storage space. Written for system administrators, power users, tech managers, and anyone who wants to learn about RAID technology, Managing RAID on Linux sidesteps the often-confusing vendor-specific approach you'll find elsewhere to give you the straight story on RAID. Even non-Linux users will find this book full of valuable material.","tags":["Software Development","Operating Systems","Linux"]},{"id":"9780470031605","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Computer Graphics for Java Programmers, Second Edition","authors":["Leen Ammeraal","Kang Zhang"],"pages":"386","publication_date":"March 2007","description":"A great many varied and interesting visual effects can be achieved with computer graphics, for which a fundamental understanding of the underlying mathematical concepts - and a knowledge of how they can be implemented in a particular programming language - is essential.\n\nComputer Graphics for Java Programmers, 2nd edition covers elementary concepts in creating and manipulating 2D and 3D graphical objects, covering topics from classic graphics algorithms to perspective drawings and hidden-line elimination.\n\nCompletely revised and updated throughout, the second edition of this highly popular textbook contains a host of ready-to-run-programs and worked examples, illuminating general principles and geometric techniques.

Objects also form the basis for many web technologies such as JavaScript, Python, and PHP.\n\nIt is of vital importance to learn the fundamental concepts of object orientation before starting to use object-oriented development environments. OOP promotes good design practices, code portability, and reuse–but it requires a shift in thinking to be fully understood. Programmers new to OOP should resist the temptation to jump directly into a particular programming language (such as Objective-C, VB .NET, C++, C# .NET, or Java) or a modeling language (such as UML), and instead first take the time to learn what author Matt Weisfeld calls “the object-oriented thought process.”\n\nWritten by a developer for developers who want to make the leap to object-oriented technologies, The Object-Oriented Thought Process provides a solutions-oriented approach to object-oriented programming. Readers will learn to understand the proper uses of inheritance and composition, the difference between aggregation and association, and the important distinction between interfaces and implementations.\n\nWhile programming technologies have been changing and evolving over the years, object-oriented concepts remain a constant–no matter what the platform. This revised edition focuses on interoperability across programming technologies, whether you are using objects in traditional application design, in XML-based data transactions, in web page development, in mobile apps, or in any modern programming environment.\n\n“Programmers who aim to create high quality software–as all programmers should–must learn the varied subtleties of the familiar yet not so familiar beasts called objects and classes. Doing so entails careful study of books such as Matt Weisfeld’s The Object-Oriented Thought Process.”\n\n–Bill McCarty, author of Java Distributed Objects, and Object-Oriented Design in Java\n\nContents at a Glance 1 Introduction to Object-Oriented Concepts 2 How to Think in Terms of Objects 3 Advanced Object-Oriented Concepts 4 The Anatomy of a Class 5 Class Design Guidelines 6 Designing with Objects 7 Mastering Inheritance and Composition 8 Frameworks and Reuse: Designing with Interfaces and Abstract Classes 9 Building Objects and Object-Oriented Design 10 Creating Object Models 11 Objects and Portable Data: XML and JSON 12 Persistent Objects: Serialization, Marshaling, and Relational Databases 13 Objects in Web Services, Mobile Apps, and Hybrids 14 Objects and Client/Server Applications 15 Design Patterns","tags":["Software Development","Software Architecture","Architectural Patterns","Object-Oriented Architecture"]},{"id":"9780735668690","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Windows Server® 2012 Inside Out","authors":["William R.

You would not know when a run was coming, how to defend pass patterns, nor when to blitz. In computer systems, as in football, a defender must be able to think like an attacker. I say it in my class every semester, you don't want to be the last person to attack your own system--you should be the first.\n\n\"The world is quickly going online. While I caution against online voting, it is clear that online gaming is taking the Internet by storm. In our new age where virtual items carry real dollar value, and fortunes are won and lost over items that do not really exist, the new threats to the intrepid gamer are all too real. To protect against these hazards, you must understand them, and this groundbreaking book is the only comprehensive source of information on how to exploit computer games.

Felten, Ph.D. Professor of Computer Science and Public Affairs Director, Center for Information Technology Policy Princeton University\n\n\"Historically, games have been used by warfighters to develop new capabilities and to hone existing skills--especially in the Air Force. The authors turn this simple concept on itself, making games themselves the subject and target of the 'hacking game,' and along the way creating a masterly publication that is as meaningful to the gamer as it is to the serious security system professional.\n\n\"Massively distributed systems will define the software field of play for at least the next quarter century. Understanding how they work is important, but understanding how they can be manipulated is essential for the security professional. This book provides the cornerstone for that knowledge.\"\n\n--Daniel McGarvey Chief, Information Protection Directorate United States Air Force\n\n\"Like a lot of kids, Gary and I came to computing (and later to computer security) through games. At first, we were fascinated with playing games on our Apple ][s, but then became bored with the few games we could afford. We tried copying each other's games, but ran up against copy-protection schemes. So we set out to understand those schemes and how they could be defeated. Pretty quickly, we realized that it was a lot more fun to disassemble and work around the protections in a game than it was to play it.\n\n\"With the thriving economies of today's online games, people not only have the classic hacker's motivation to understand and bypass the security of games, but also the criminal motivation of cold, hard cash. That's a combination that's hard to stop. The first step, taken by this book, is revealing the techniques that are being used today.\"\n\n--Greg Morrisett, Ph.D. Allen B. Cutting Professor of Computer Science School of Engineering and Applied Sciences Harvard University\n\n\"If you're playing online games today and you don't understand security, you're at a real disadvantage.

The stakes are too high. Fortunately, the idea of 'quality management' is being reinvigorated. In the last decade process programs have become more and more prevalent. And, out of all the available options, three have moved to the top of the chain. These three are:\n\nThe 9001:2000 Quality Management Standard from the International Standards Organization;\nThe Capability Maturity Model Integration from the Software Engineering Institute; and\nSix Sigma, a methodology for improvement shaped by companies such as Motorola, Honeywell, and General Electric.\n\nThese recognized and proven quality programs are rising in popularity as more technology managers are looking for ways to help remove degrees of risk and uncertainty from their business equations, and to introduce methods of predictability that better ensure success.\n\nProcess Improvement Essentials combines the foundation needed to understand process improvement theory with the best practices to help individuals implement process improvement initiatives in their organization. The three leading programs: ISO 9001:2000, CMMI, and Six Sigma--amidst the buzz and hype--tend to get lumped together under a common label. This book delivers a combined guide to all three programs, compares their applicability, and then sets the foundation for further exploration.

Healthcare must change—dramatically. Many leading healthcare institutions are discovering a powerful toolset for addressing both quality and cost: Six Sigma. In this hands-on, start-to-finish guidebook, four leading experts introduce Six Sigma from the unique standpoint of the healthcare professional, showing exactly how to implement it in real-world environments.\n\nDrawing on their unsurpassed experience, the authors offer step-by-step methodologies, tools, and metrics—all thoroughly adapted to the unique realities of healthcare. They demonstrate how to utilize Six Sigma’s Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control (DMAIC) process to address even the most challenging problems. They also offer realistic guidance on rolling out Six Sigma initiatives that deliver rapid and sustainable value.\n\nThe authors show Six Sigma at work in every area of the hospital: clinical, radiology, surgery, ICU, cardiovascular, laboratories, emergency, trauma, administrative services, staffing, billing, cafeteria, even central supply. You'll learn why Six Sigma can produce better results than other quality initiatives, how it brings new rigor and discipline to healthcare delivery, and how it can be used to sustain ongoing improvements for the long term.\n\nCoverage includes\n\n·         Adapting Six Sigma methodology, tools, and measurements for healthcare\n\n·         Designing more successful experiments\n\n·         Rolling out your Six Sigma initiative successfully\n\n·         Case studies from every area of the hospital, from the ICU to billing\n\n·         Six Sigma templates modified fully for the healthcare environment\n\nComprehensive and user-friendly, this book will be indispensable to everyone concerned with quality or cost: administrators, managers, physicians, and quality specialists alike.

Next, we move to a general use case example by creating an object spawner EditorTool for the scene view. Later, we dive straight to in-depth stats and detailed case studies of two Unity assets: ProArray and Rhythm Game Starter. Here you’ll get more context on how editor scripting is used in published assets.\n\nYou will also learn how to set up a better workflow for editor scripting, asset publishing, maintenance, and iterative updates. You will leverage the power of modern web technology to build a documentation site with GitBook and DocFX. Finally, you will see some tips and tricks for automating asset versioning and changelogs. \n\nWhat You Will Learn\n\nGet started with Editor scripting in Unity\nWork with advanced editor topics such as custom EditorWindows and EditorTool\nStructure your C# code with namespaces and asmdef\nUse IMGUI and UI Toolkit for creating editor GUIs\nMaster packaging and selling your own editor tools\nSet up a better workflow for asset publishing, maintenance, and iterative updates\n\nWho This Book Is For\n\nReaders who want to learn about editor scripting to improve their game-development process and create tools forthemselves.

It's like a shiny new car--no longer content to just admire Eclipse, you're now itching to get in and drive. Eclipse is to Java developers what Visual Studio is to .NET developers--it's an integrated development environment (IDE) that combines a code editor, compiler, debugger, text editor, graphical user interface (GUI) builder, and other components into a single, user-friendly application. It provides a solid foundation that enables Java developers to construct and run integrated software-development tools for web development, application design, modeling, performance, testing, and much more. As with any extensive programming tool, however, there's a lot to learn. And there s no better guy than well-known Java expert Steve Holzner to teach you. An award-winning and best-selling author who has been writing about Java topics since the language first appeared, Holzner delivers just the kind of targeted, practical, everyday knowledge you need to hone your mastery of Eclipse. Perfect as a companion to an Eclipse programming tutorial (such as Holzner's own Eclipse, O'Reilly, April 2004) or an ideal stand-alone for all those developers who either don't want or don't need the tutorial approach, the Eclipse Cookbook contains task-oriented recipes for more than 800 situations you may encounter while using this new Java platform--from deploying a web application automatically to reverse engineering compiled code, from re-naming all references to a class across multiple packages to initializing the SWT JNI libraries. Each recipe in the ever-popular and utterly practical problem-solution-discussion format for O'Reilly cookbooks contains a clear and thorough description of the problem, a brief but complete discussion of a solution, and in-action examples illustrating that solution. The Eclipse Cookbook will satiate Java programmers at all levels who are ready to go beyond tutorials--far beyond writing plug-ins and extensions--and actually use the powerful and convenient Eclipse day to day.","tags":["Software Development","Text Editors & IDEs","Eclipse IDE"]},{"id":"9780134856360","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Windows 10 In Depth (includes Content Update Program), Second edition","authors":["Brian Knittel","Paul McFedries"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"February 2018","description":"This new edition covers the Fall Creators Update to Windows 10.\n\nDo more in less time!\n\nExperienced with Windows?

The Digital Zone System (DZS) is an innovative methodology for editing digital images that mimics the Zone System created by Adams. With this book, author Robert Fisher presents a practical guide for editing digital images with a level of control previously unattainable without significant manual work. He walks the reader through the background of Adam's original Zone System and points out similarities to current digital processes including Expose to the Right (ETTR) and high dynamic range imaging (HDRI). Learn to use luminance masks to separate an image into \"one-stop\" zones of brightness, similar to the zones in Adams's Zone System, that can be worked on individually or in groups. This makes the DZS a powerful tool for converting color images to black and white. You will also gain tremendous control over how color is adjusted in your images by learning to isolate and adjust color in specific targeted areas. These DZS processes are quicker and simpler than the tedious work of using global adjustments and painting in layer masks to isolate the effects of an adjustment layer.In this book, you will learn how to use the Digital Zone System for editing color images, converting images to black and white, and tone mapping HDR images. Also included are brief discussions of color management, setting up Photoshop, printing, and exposure for digital images. The book is richly illustrated with step-by-step screenshots and stunning example images that show the benefits of the Digital Zone System over commonly used digital editing methods. Once mastered, the DZS will allow you to produce a higher level of quality in your images, at a faster pace and with greater ease than ever before.","tags":["Software Development","Graphics Programming","Digital Image Processing"]},{"id":"9781491909683","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Swift Development with Cocoa","authors":["Paris Buttfield-Addison","Jonathon Manning","Tim Nugent"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"December 2014","description":"Ready to build apps for iPhone, iPad, and Mac now that Swift has landed?

Written by an author team of veteran programmers and developers, Professional Visual Studio 2010 gets you quickly up to speed on what you can expect from the newest version of Visual Studio.\n\nThis book's first section is dedicated to familiarizing you with the core aspects of Visual Studio 2010. Everything you need is contained in the first five chapters, from the IDE structure and layout to the various options and settings you can change to make the user interface synchronize with your own way of doing things.\n\nFrom there, the remainder of the book is broken into 11 parts:\n\nGetting Started: In this part, you learn how to take control of your projects and organize them in ways that work with your own style.\n\nDigging Deeper: Though the many graphical components of Visual Studio that make a programmer's job easier are discussed in many places throughout this book, you often need help when you're in the process of actually writing code. This part deals with features that support the coding of applications such as IntelliSense, code refactoring, and creating and running unit tests In the latest version of the .NET framework, enhancements were added to support dynamic languages and move towards feature parity between the two primary .NET languages, C# and VB. This part covers changes to these languages, as well as looking at a range of features that will help you write better and more consistent code.\n\nRich Client and Web Applications: For support building everything from Office add-ins to cloud applications, Visual Studio enables you to develop applications for a wide range of platforms. These two parts cover the application platforms that are supported within Visual Studio 2010, including ASP.NET and Office, WPF, Silverlight 2 and ASP.NET MVC.\n\nData: A large proportion of applications use some form of data storage. Visual Studio 2010 and the .NET Framework include strong support for working with databases and other data sources. This part examines how to use DataSets, the Visual Database Tools, LINQ, Synchronization Services and ADO.NET Entity Framework to build applications that work with data. It also shows you how you can then present this data using Reporting.\n\nApplication Services: Through the course of building an application you are likely to require access to services that may or may not reside within your organization. This part covers core technologies such as WCF, WF, Synchronization Services and WCF RIA services that you can use to connect to these services.\n\nConfiguration and Internationalization: The built-in support for configuration files allows you to adjust the way an application functions on the fly without having to rebuild it. Furthermore, resource files can be used to both access static data and easily localize an application into foreign languages and cultures. This part of the book shows how to use .NET configuration and resource files.\n\nDebugging: Application debugging is one of the more challenging tasks developers have to tackle, but correct use of the Visual Studio 2010 debugging features will help you analyze the state of the application and determine the cause of any bugs. This part examines the rich debugging support provided by the IDE.\n\nBuild and Deployment: In addition to discussing how to build your solutions effectively and getting applications into the hands of your end users, this part also deals with the process of upgrading your projects from previous versions.\n\nCustomizing and Extending Visual Studio: If the functionality found in the previous part isn't enough to help you in your coding efforts, Microsoft has made Visual Studio 2010 even more extensible. This part covers the automation model, how to write add-ins and macros, and then how to use a new extensibility framework, MEF, to extend Visual Studio 2010.\n\nVisual Studio Ultimate: The final part of the book examines the additional features only available in the Premium and Ultimate versions of Visual Studio 2010. In addition, you'll also learn how the Team Foundation Server provides an essential tool for managing software projects.\n\nThough this breakdown of the Visual Studio feature set provides the most logical and easily understood set of topics, you may need to look for specific functions that will aid you in a particular activity. To address this need, references to appropriate chapters are provided whenever a feature is covered in more detail elsewhere in the book.\n\nProfessional Visual Studio 2010 is for all developers new to Visual Studio as well as those programmers who have some experience but want to learn about features they may have previously overlooked.\n\nIf you are familiar with the way previous versions of Visual Studio worked, you may want to skim over Part I, which deals with the basic constructs that make up the user interface, and move on to the remainder of the book where the new features found in Visual Studio 2010 are discussed in detail. While you may be familiar with most of Part I, it is worth reading this section in case there are features of Visual Studio 2010 that you haven't seen or used before.\n\nIf you're just starting out, you'll greatly benefit from the first part, where basic concepts are explained and you're introduced to the user interface and how to customize it to suit your own style.","tags":["Software Development","Programming Languages",".NET","Windows Forms"]},{"id":"9781788997560","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Mastering Ubuntu Server - Second Edition","authors":["Jay LaCroix"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"May 2018","description":"\"Mastering Ubuntu Server\" provides a comprehensive guide for deploying, configuring, and managing Ubuntu Server 18.04.

It incorporates recent work that has not appeared in other books and draws on the author’s considerable research in the field, including his recently developed class of SUMMA algorithms. Related to sequential unconstrained minimization methods, the SUMMA class includes a wide range of iterative algorithms well known to researchers in various areas, such as statistics and image processing.\n\nOrganizing the topics from general to more specific, the book first gives an overview of sequential optimization, the subclasses of auxiliary-function methods, and the SUMMA algorithms. The next three chapters present particular examples in more detail, including barrier- and penalty-function methods, proximal minimization, and forward-backward splitting. The author also focuses on fixed-point algorithms for operators on Euclidean space and then extends the discussion to include distance measures other than the usual Euclidean distance. In the final chapters, specific problems illustrate the use of iterative methods previously discussed. Most chapters contain exercises that introduce new ideas and make the book suitable for self-study.\n\nUnifying a variety of seemingly disparate algorithms, the book shows how to derive new properties of algorithms by comparing known properties of other algorithms. This unifying approach also helps researchers—from statisticians working on parameter estimation to image scientists processing scanning data to mathematicians involved in theoretical and applied optimization—discover useful related algorithms in areas outside of their expertise.","tags":["Software Development","Computer Science","Algorithms"]},{"id":"9780132441919","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Power System Transient Stability Analysis Using the Transient Energy Function Method","authors":["Abdel-Azia Fouad","Iowa State University Vijay Vittal - Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering"],"pages":"384","publication_date":"August 1991","description":"This book details the state of the art in the development and application of the transient energy function (TEF) method as a tool for power system transient stability assessment.

However, large-scale agile development is difficult, and publicly available case studies have been scarce. Now, three agile pioneers at Hewlett-Packard present a candid, start-to-finish insider’s look at how they’ve succeeded with agile in one of the company’s most mission-critical software environments: firmware for HP LaserJet printers. This book tells the story of an extraordinary experiment and journey. Could agile principles be applied to re-architect an enormous legacy code base? Could agile enable both timely delivery and ongoing innovation? Could it really be applied to 400+ developers distributed across four states, three continents, and four business units? Could it go beyond delivering incremental gains, to meet the stretch goal of 10x developer productivity improvements? It could, and it did—but getting there was not easy. Writing for both managers and technologists, the authors candidly discuss both their successes and failures, presenting actionable lessons for other development organizations, as well as approaches that have proven themselves repeatedly in HP’s challenging environment. They not only illuminate the potential benefits of agile in large-scale development, they also systematically show how these benefits can actually be achieved. Coverage includes: • Tightly linking agile methods and enterprise architecture with business objectives • Focusing agile practices on your worst development pain points to get the most bang for your buck • Abandoning classic agile methods that don’t work at the largest scale • Employing agile methods to establish a new architecture • Using metrics as a “conversation starter” around agile process improvements • Leveraging continuous integration and quality systems to reduce costs, accelerate schedules, and automate the delivery pipeline • Taming the planning beast with “light-touch” agile planning and lightweight long-range forecasting • Implementing effective project management and ensuring accountability in large agile projects • Managing tradeoffs associated with key decisions about organizational structure • Overcoming U.S./India cultural differences that can complicate offshore development • Selecting tools to support quantum leaps in productivity in your organization • Using change management disciplines to support greater enterprise agility","tags":["Software Development","Software Collaboration","Agile"]},{"id":"067232847X","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Red Hat Fedora 5 Unleashed","authors":["Andrew Hudson","Paul Hudson"],"pages":"1104","publication_date":"May 2006","description":"Continuing with the tradition of offering the best and most comprehensive coverage of Red Hat Linux on the market, Red Hat Fedora 5 Unleashed includes new and additional material based on the latest release of Red Hat's Fedora Core Linux distribution.

With Java 5.0, you'll not only find substantial changes in the platform, but to the language itself-something that developers of Java took five years to complete. The main goal of Java 5.0 is to make it easier for you to develop safe, powerful code, but none of these improvements makes Java any easier to learn, even if you've programmed with Java for years. And that means our bestselling hands-on tutorial takes on even greater significance.Learning Java is the most widely sought introduction to the programming language that's changed the way we think about computing. Our updated third edition takes an objective, no-nonsense approach to the new features in Java 5.0, some of which are drastically different from the way things were done in any previous versions. The most essential change is the addition of \"generics\", a feature that allows developers to write, test, and deploy code once, and then reuse the code again and again for different data types. The beauty of generics is that more problems will be caught during development, and Learning Java will show you exactly how it's done.Java 5.0 also adds more than 1,000 new classes to the Java library. That means 1,000 new things you can do without having to program it in yourself. That's a huge change. With our book's practical examples, you'll come up to speed quickly on this and other new features such as loops and threads. The new edition also includes an introduction to Eclipse, the open source IDE that is growing in popularity. Learning Java, 3rd Edition addresses all of the important uses of Java, such as web applications, servlets, and XML that are increasingly driving enterprise applications.","tags":["Software Development","Programming Languages","JVM Languages","Java"]},{"id":"9781118754795","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"MCSA Windows Server 2012 Complete Study Guide: Exams 70-410, 70-411, 70-412, and 70-417","authors":["William Panek"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"July 2013","description":"Prepare for the MCSA Windows Server 2012 exams with this Sybex study guide\n\nMicrosoft's new version of the MCSA certification for Windows Server 2012 requires passing three exams.

Beans is the next generation of Java technology that not only adds features the language lacked, but also lets Java programs interoperate with a number of development environments. The initial release includes a bridge for Microsoft's ActiveX/COM; future releases will include bridges for Netscape's LiveConnect and IBM's OpenDoc. Since it's a \"component architecture\" for Java, Beans can be used in graphical programming environments, like Borland's JBuilder, or IBM's VisualAge for Java. This means that someone can use a graphical tool to connect a lot of Beans together and make an application, without actually writing any Java code -- in fact, without doing any programming at all. Graphical development environments let you configure components by specifying aspects of their visual appearance (like the color or label of a button) in addition to the interactions between components (what happens when you click on a button or select a menu item). One important aspect of Java Beans is that components don't have to be visible. This sounds like a minor distinction, but it's very important: the invisible parts of an application are the parts that do the work. So, for example, in addition to manipulating graphical widgets, like checkboxes and menus, Beans allows you to develop and manipulate components that do database access, perform computations, and so on. You can build entire applications by connecting pre-built components, without writing any code. Developing Java Beans is for people who need to stay up-to-date with the latest developments in programming technology. Minimally, developing Beans means adopting several simple design patterns in your code. However, that's only the beginning. To take full advantage of the Java Beans architecture, you should understand how to write classes that are serializable, use events for communication between classes, know when and how to provide BeanInfo classes that give graphical environments more information about your components, and provide property editors and customizers that let graphical tools work with more complex Beans.

ASP.NET is Microsoft's latest evolution of ASP. While ASP.NET has a lot in common with its predecessor, this new technology takes advantage of object-oriented programming to dramatically improve developer productivity and convenience. Using the .NET Framework and Microsoft's new object-oriented languages, ASP.NET brings the same rapid drag-and-drop productivity to web applications that the Visual Basic programming language brought to Windows applications. ASP.NET also introduces web services, which allow developers to expose the functionality of an application via HTTP and XML, so that clients on any platform can access it via the Internet. ASP.NET is not a simple upgrade of ASP. It s a quantum leap ahead. There are many benefits to using ASP.NET, and one major drawback: the time developers must devote to mastering this new Web application technology. The ASP.NET Cookbook provides a wealth of plug-and-play solutions to problems commonly encountered when developing ASP.NET web applications and services in the popular problem-solution-discussion Cookbook format. The coding solutions in ASP.NET Cookbook appeal to a wide range of developers, from the inexperienced to the expert. For every problem addressed in the book, there's a worked-out solution or recipe a short, focused piece of code that web developers can insert directly into their applications. Developers can save hours by using just a single one of over 100 recipes included in this invaluable cookbook. But the ASP.NET Cookbook provides far more than just a wide range of cut-and-paste code solutions. Each recipe is followed by a discussion including tips, tricks, and possible pitfalls--so developers can learn to adapt the problem-solving techniques to a myriad of similar situations. Each recipe provides an immediate solution to a pressing problem, while simultaneously allowing developers who prefer to a hands-on learning style with the experience they need to master ASP.NET.

While the creation of algorithms and machine learning attempts to eliminate bias, they are, after all, created by human beings, and thus are susceptible to what we call algorithmic bias.\n\nIn Understand, Manage, and Prevent Algorithmic Bias, author Tobias Baer helps you understand where algorithmic bias comes from, how to manage it as a business user or regulator, and how data science can prevent bias from entering statistical algorithms. Baer expertly addresses someof the 100+ varieties of natural bias such as confirmation bias, stability bias, pattern-recognition bias, and many others. Algorithmic bias mirrors—and originates in—these human tendencies. Baer dives into topics as diverse as anomaly detection, hybrid model structures, and self-improving machine learning.\n\nWhile most writings on algorithmic bias focus on the dangers, the core of this positive, fun book points toward a path where bias is kept at bay and even eliminated. You’ll come away with managerial techniques to develop unbiased algorithms, the ability to detect bias more quickly, and knowledge to create unbiased data. Understand, Manage, and Prevent Algorithmic Bias is an innovative, timely, and important book that belongs on your shelf. Whether you are a seasoned business executive, a data scientist, or simply an enthusiast, now is a crucial time to be educated about the impact of algorithmic bias on society and take an active role in fighting bias.\n\nWhat You'll Learn\n\nStudy the many sources of algorithmic bias, including cognitive biases in the real world, biased data, and statistical artifact\nUnderstand the risks of algorithmic biases, how to detect them, and managerial techniques to prevent or manage them\nAppreciate how machine learning both introduces new sources of algorithmic bias and can be a part of a solution\nBe familiar with specific statistical techniques a data scientist can use to detect and overcome algorithmic bias\n\nWho This Book is For\n\nBusiness executives of companies using algorithms in daily operations; data scientists (from students to seasoned practitioners) developing algorithms; compliance officials concerned about algorithmic bias; politicians, journalists, and philosophers thinking about algorithmic bias in terms of its impact on society and possible regulatory responses;and consumers concerned about how they might be affected by algorithmic bias","tags":["Software Development","Computer Science","Algorithms"]},{"id":"9781118282878","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Linux Bible, 8th Edition","authors":["Christopher Negus","Christine Bresnahan"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"September 2012","description":"More than 50 percent new and revised content for today's Linux environment gets you up and running in no time!\n\nLinux continues to be an excellent, low-cost alternative to expensive operating systems.

This vast data becomes the new natural resource that these organizations must tap in to innovate and stay ahead of the competition, and they must do so in a secure environment that protects the data throughout its lifecyle and data access in real time at any time.\n\nWhen it comes to security, nothing can rival IBM® Z, the multi-workload transactional platform that powers the core business processes of the majority of the Fortune 500 enterprises with unmatched security, availability, reliability, and scalability. With core transactions and data originating on IBM Z, it simply makes sense for analytics to exist and run on the same platform.\n\nFor years, some businesses chose to move their sensitive data off IBM Z to platforms that include data lakes, Hadoop, and warehouses for analytics processing. However, the massive growth of digital data, the punishing cost of security exposures as well as the unprecedented demand for instant actionable intelligence from data in real time have convinced them to rethink that decision and, instead, embrace the strategy of data gravity for analytics. At the core of data gravity is the conviction that analytics must exist and run where the data resides. An IBM client eloquently compares this change in analytics strategy to a shift from \"moving the ocean to the boat to moving the boat to the ocean,\" where the boat is the analytics and the ocean is the data.\n\nIBM respects and invests heavily on data gravity because it recognizes the tremendous benefits that data gravity can deliver to you, including reduced cost and minimized security risks. IBM Machine Learning for z/OS® is one of the offerings that decidedly move analytics to Z where your mission-critical data resides. In the inherently secure Z environment, your machine learning scoring services can co-exist with your transactional applications and data, supporting high throughput and minimizing response time while delivering consistent service level agreements (SLAs).\n\nThis book introduces Machine Learning for z/OS version 1.1.0 and describes its unique value proposition. It provides step-by-step guidance for you to get started with the program, including best practices for capacity planning, installation and configuration, administration and operation. Through a retail example, the book shows how you can use the versatile and intuitive web user interface to quickly train, build, evaluate, and deploy a model. Most importantly, it examines use cases across industries to illustrate how you can easily turn your massive data into valuable insights with Machine Learning for z/OS.","tags":["Software Development","Operating Systems","z/OS"]},{"id":"9781430225119","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Pro ASP.NET 4 in VB 2010, Third Edition","authors":["Matthew MacDonald","Dan Mabbutt","Adam Freeman"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"October 2010","description":"ASP.NET 4 is the latest version of Microsoft's revolutionary ASP.NET technology.

However, for the “non-agile” development organization, transitioning to agility is an enormous leap, requiring radically new skills and presenting profound risks.\n\nIn this book, leading agile practitioner Carol A. Wellington introduces the first systematic, three-phase process for moving smoothly to agility. Just as developers have learned to refactor code to improve performance and maintainability, Wellington shows how to refactor processes to improve agility.\n\nUsing Wellington’s framework, you can gradually move toward agility, while maintaining full control and avoiding disruption. You’ll lay a solid foundation for agility, and then refactor more and more of your processes, systematically introducing agility wherever it delivers compelling value. You can retain current processes that work, and implement the best agile methods for your organization, regardless of their source. This practical approach can help you build organizational confidence in agility, drive measurable benefits, and minimize risk every step of the way.\n\nCoverage includes\n\n·        Phase 1: Time-boxed iterations that deliver customer-visible functionality–not just components\n\n·        Phase 2: A lightweight measurement process to detect problems and evaluate changes withoutwasting too much time gathering and analyzing data\n\n·        Phase 3: Identifying your worst process “smells,” uncovering their true underlying causes, and fixing them\n\n·        Incrementally bringing agility to planning, estimation, analysis, design, development, and process management\n\n·        Eliminating tasks and processes that don’t add value\n\n·        Overcoming pitfalls and hidden interconnections that complicate your agile transition\n\n·        Learning to lead the transition to agility, gaining buy-in from team members, customers, and executives\n\nWhatever your role, organization, or current methodology, Refactoring to Agility can help you reap powerful value from agile methods–without the risks.\n\nDr. Carol A.

The research is basedon in-depth interviews with 15 ING executives and many front-line employees. The article highlightskey learnings at ING, largely from the point of view of the senior executives of the bank, and exploresthe challenges of implementing agile in an established organization, focusing on five lessons:1. Decide how much power you are willing to give up. Agile shifts power away from those at the topand puts ownership in the hands of those closest to the action. Unless top executives are willing toaccept that they are surrendering some status and power, agile will not be a good fit.2. Prepare stakeholders for the leap. ING executives had to sell agile to nervous stakeholders, including board members, employees, and bank regulators. For example, executives assured regulators thatfinance, compliance, and legal functions would continue to be managed in the traditional way.3. Build the structure around customers — and keep it fluid. Like other approaches to management,agile is focused on customers. ING in the Netherlands has tried to keep its organizational structurefluid so that it can evolve to do what's best for customers.4. Give employees the right balance of oversight and autonomy. A quarterly goal-setting process is part ofthe agile structure at ING in the Netherlands. This has been a learning process. Initially, groups definedgoals that were comfortably achievable, and executives had to urge them toward more ambitious targets.5. Provide employees with development and growth opportunities. The team-based structures used inagile can be scary for employees used to having their personal development and career progressionmapped out by HR departments or the mainstream career trajectories of a given industry. One lessonfrom ING's experience is that finding proper coaching and support for agile — and the new, long-termresponsibilities employees must embrace — is one of the hardest parts of the transformation.","tags":["Software Development","Software Collaboration","Agile"]},{"id":"9780470229880","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Professional Visual Studio® 2008","authors":["Nick Randolph","David Gardner"],"pages":"1026","publication_date":"July 2008","description":"Professional Visual Studio 2008\n\nMicrosoft Visual Studio 2008 is the latest version in the ongoing evolution of the Integrated Development Environment (IDE), and this resource examines the diverse facets of the IDE—from common tasks to intricate functions to the powerful tools that accompany the main code editing and design windows.

Often in programming books, the information can be hidden in a vast sea of words. As a programmer who has over the years used a dozen programming languages, the author understands it can sometimes be difficult to slog through another 1,000-page book of dense text to learn a new language. There are likely many other programmers who feel the same way. To address this situation, this book explains C# 5.0 using figures; short, focused code samples; and clear, concise explanations.\n\nFigures are of prime importance in this book. While teaching programming seminars, Daniel Solis found that he could almost watch the light bulbs going on over the students' heads as he drew the figures on the whiteboard. In this text, he has distilled each important concept into simple but accurate illustrations. The visual presentation of the content will give you an understanding of C# that's not possible with text alone.\n\nFor something as intricate and precise as a programming language, however, there must be text as well as figures. But rather than long, wordy explanations, Solis has used short, concise descriptions and bulleted lists to make each important piece of information visually distinct.\n\nBy the end of this book, you'll have a thorough working knowledge of all aspects of the C# language, whether you're a novice programmer or a seasoned veteran of other languages. If you want a long, leisurely, verbose explanation of the language, this is not the book for you.

It covers the various topics in such a manner that you will progressively learn without being overwhelmed by the details. It adopts the philosophy that the best way to learn is by doing, hence the numerous Try It Out sections in all the chapters, which first show you how to build something and then explain how things work.\n\nAlthough iPad programming is a huge topic, the aim for this book is to get you started with the fundamentals, and help you understand the underlying architecture of the SDK, and appreciate why things are done certain ways. After reading this book (and doing the exercises), you will be well equipped to tackle your next iPad programming challenge.\n\nThis book is for the beginning iPad developer who wants to start developing iPad applications using the Apple iPhone SDK. To truly benefit from this book, you should have some background in programming and at least be familiar with object-oriented programming concepts. If you are totally new to the Objective-C language, you might want to jump straight to Appendix D, which provides an overview of the language. Alternatively, you can use Appendix D as a quick reference while you tackle the various chapters, checking out the syntax as you try the exercises. Depending on your learning pattern, one of those approaches may work best for you.\n\nWhat This Book Covers\n\nThis book covers the fundamentals of iPad programming using the iPhone SDK. It is divided into 18 chapters and four appendices.\n\nChapter 1: Getting Started with iPad Programming covers the various tools found in the iPhone SDK and explains their uses in iPad development.\n\nChapter 2: Write Your First Hello World!

Every action you request creates one or more messages to carry out the action. These messages are passed between objects and carry with them information that gives the recipient more detail on how to interpret and act upon the message.With Subclassing and the Windows hooking mechanism (\"hooks\"), you can manipulate, modify, or even discard messages bound for other objects within the operating system, in the process changing the way the system behaves. What kinds of results can you achieve using the power of subclassing and hooking? Here are just a few of the possibilities:\n\nDetermine when a window is being activated or deactivated and respond to this change.\nDisplay descriptions of menu items as the mouse moves across them.\nDisallow a user to move or resize a window.\nDetermine where the mouse cursor is and respond accordingly.\nDetermine when the display resolution has been changed.\nMonitor the system for a low system resource condition.\nModify or disallow keystrokes sent to a window or a control.\nCreate an automated testing application.\nDetermine when an application is idle.\nAlong with this power comes responsibility; Windows is very unforgiving if subclassing and hooking are used incorrectly. Subclassing & Hooking with Visual Basic demonstrates the various techniques for intercepting messages bound for one or more windows or controls: the intercepted message can be left in its original state or modified; afterwards, the message can be sent to its original destination or discarded.For both VB 6 and VB.NET developers, Subclassing & Hooking with Visual Basic opens up a wealth of possibilities that ordinarily would be completely unavailable, or at least not easy to implement.","tags":["Software Development","Programming Languages",".NET","VB"]},{"id":"0596004281","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"VB.NET Language Pocket Reference","authors":["Steven Roman PhD","Ron Petrusha","Paul Lomax"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"December 2002","description":"Visual Basic .NET is a radically new version of Microsoft Visual Basic, the world's most widely used rapid application development (RAD) package.

As polynomial problems can be treated by exact methods, the problem posed concerns non-polynomial problems, for which it is necessary to develop efficient algorithms based on heuristics or meta-heuristics. Chapter 3 of this book demonstrates how to develop such algorithms, which are characterized by: an initialization of argued solutions (sometimes, the global optimum can be obtained from such an initialization); a non-random generation of solutions (to avoid generating the same solution several times, or even generating solutions that cannot be achieved); avoidance of being trapped by a local optimum; good use of CPU time by reducing the size of the space of solutions to be explored (which is often very large for such problems) without compromising the quality of the solution; plus a reasoned displacement from one solution to another, to improve the quality of the solution as the processing is carried out. These aspects are applied to concrete applications in the design of integrated circuits and systems at various levels. To do this and to help the reader better understand this problem, Chapters 1 and 2 present basic notions on computational complexity, and the design of integrated circuits and systems.","tags":["Software Development","Computer Science","Algorithms"]},{"id":"9780738460222","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Getting Started with z/OS Data Set Encryption","authors":["Bill White","Cecilia Carranza Lewis","Eysha Shirrine Powers"],"pages":"252","publication_date":"December 2021","description":"This IBM® Redpaper Redbooks® publication provides a broad explanation of data protection through encryption and IBM Z® pervasive encryption with a focus on IBM z/OS® data set encryption.

Superseding earlier technologies, such as COM/DCOM, .NET Remoting, ASP.NET Web Services, and the Web Services Enhancements for .NET, WCF provides a single solution that is designed to always be the best way to exchange data among software entities. It also provides the infrastructure for developing the next generation of Web services, with support for the WS-* family of specifications, and a new serialization system for enhanced performance. For information technology professionals, WCF supplies an impressive array of administration tools that enterprises and software vendors can use to reduce the cost of ownership of their solutions without writing a single line of code. Most important, WCF finally delivers on the long-postponed promise of model-driven software development with the new software factory approach, by which one can iteratively design solutions in a modeling language and generate executables from lower-level class libraries.\n\nWindows Communication Foundation Unleashed is designed to be the best resource for software developers and architects working with WCF. The book guides readers toward a conceptual understanding of all the facilities of WCF and provides step-by-step guides to applying the technology to practical problems.\n\nIntroduces you to WCF and then takes you deep inside the technology\n\nGives you nearly 100 best practices for programming with WCF\n\nProvides detailed coverage on how to version services that you will not find anywhere else\n\nDelves into using WCF together with Windows Workflow Foundation and Windows CardSpace\n\nProvides detailed coverage of the new high-performance data contract serializer for .NET\n\nWalks you through how to do secure, reliable, transacted messaging, and how to understand the options available\n\nIntroduces you to federated, claims-based security, and shows you how to incorporate SAML and WS-Trust security token services into your architecture\n\nProvides step-by-step instructions for how to customize every aspect of WCF\n\nShows you how to add your own behaviors, communication channels, message encoders, and transports\n\nGives you options for implementing publish/subscribe solutions\n\nWalks you through how to do peer-to-peer communications with WCF\n\nAs evangelists at Microsoft for WCF, Craig McMurtry, Marc Mercuri, Nigel Watling, and Matt Winkler are uniquely positioned to write this book.

First, he describes the primary area where many software architects fail and shows how to decompose a system into smaller building blocks or services, based on volatility. Next, he shows how to flow an effective project design from the system design; how to accurately calculate the project duration, cost, and risk; and how to devise multiple execution options.\n\nThe method and principles in Righting Software apply regardless of your project and company size, technology, platform, or industry. Löwy starts the reader on a journey that addresses the critical challenges of software development today by righting software systems and projects as well as careers–and possibly the software industry as a whole. Software professionals, architects, project leads, or managers at any stage of their career will benefit greatly from this book, which provides guidance and knowledge that would otherwise take decades and many projects to acquire.\n\nRegister your book for convenient access to downloads, updates, and/or corrections as they become available.

You might think the problem is your brain. It seems to have a mind of its own, a mind that doesn't always want to take in the dry, technical stuff you're forced to study. The fact is your brain craves novelty. It's constantly searching, scanning, waiting for something unusual to happen. After all, that's the way it was built to help you stay alive. It takes all the routine, ordinary, dull stuff and filters it to the background so it won't interfere with your brain's real work--recording things that matter. How does your brain know what matters? It's like the creators of the Head First approach say, suppose you're out for a hike and a tiger jumps in front of you, what happens in your brain? Neurons fire. Emotions crank up. Chemicals surge. That's how your brain knows.And that's how your brain will learn Java. Head First Java combines puzzles, strong visuals, mysteries, and soul-searching interviews with famous Java objects to engage you in many different ways. It's fast, it's fun, and it's effective. And, despite its playful appearance, Head First Java is serious stuff: a complete introduction to object-oriented programming and Java. You'll learn everything from the fundamentals to advanced topics, including threads, network sockets, and distributed programming with RMI. And the new. second edition focuses on Java 5.0, the latest version of the Java language and development platform.

Combine Clojure's tools for maximum effectiveness as you work with immutable data, functional programming, and safe concurrency to write programs that solve real-world problems.\n\nStart by reading and understanding Clojure syntax and see how Clojure is evaluated. From there, find out about the sequence abstraction, which combines immutable collections with functional programming to create truly reusable data transformation code. Clojure is a functional language; learn how to write programs in a functional style, and when and how to use recursion to your advantage. Discover Clojure's unique approach to state and identity, techniques for polymorphism and open systems using multimethods and protocols, and how to leverage Clojure's metaprogramming capabilities via macros. Finally, put all the pieces together in a real program.\n\nNew to this edition is coverage of Clojure's spec library, one of the most interesting new features of Clojure for describing both data and functions. You can use Clojure spec to validate data, destructure data, explain invalid data, and generate large numbers of tests to verify the correctness of your code.\n\nWith this book, you'll learn how to think in Clojure, and how to take advantage of its combined strengths to build powerful programs quickly.\n\nWhat You Need:\n\nJava 6 or higher\nClojure 1.9","tags":["Software Development","Programming Languages","JVM Languages","Clojure"]},{"id":"9781633438934","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Learn Haskell by Example","authors":["Philipp Hagenlocher"],"pages":"456","publication_date":"December 2024","description":"Learn Haskell by doing Haskell projects!

Perry"],"pages":"499","publication_date":"May 2024","description":"This book teaches you how to evaluate a distributed system from the perspective of immutable objects. You will understand the problems in existing designs, know how to make small modifications to correct those problems, and learn to apply the principles of immutable architecture to your tools.\nMost software components focus on the state of objects. They store the current state of a row in a relational database. They track changes to state over time, making several basic assumptions: there is a single latest version of each object, the state of an object changes sequentially, and a system of record exists.\nThis is a challenge when it comes to building distributed systems. Whether dealing with autonomous microservices or disconnected mobile apps, many of the problems we try to solve come down to synchronizing an ever-changing state between isolated components. Distributed systems would be a lot easier to build if objects could not change.\nAfter reading The Art of Immutable Architecture, you will come away with an understanding of the benefits of using immutable objects in your own distributed systems. You will learn a set of rules for identifying and exchanging immutable objects, and see a collection of useful theorems that emerges and ensures that the distributed systems you build are eventually consistent. Using patterns, you will find where the truth converges, see how changes are associative, rather than sequential, and come to feel comfortable understanding that there is no longer a single source of truth. Practical hands-on examples reinforce how to build software using the described patterns, techniques, and tools. By the end of the book, you will possess the language and resources needed to analyze and construct distributed systems with confidence.\nThe assumptions of the past were sufficient for building single-user, single-computer systems. But aswe expand to multiple devices, shared experiences, and cloud computing, they work against us. It is time for a new set of assumptions. Start with immutable objects, and build better distributed systems.\n\nWhat You Will Learn\nEvaluate a distributed system from the perspective of immutable objects \nRecognize the problems in existing designs, and make small modifications to correct them\nStart a new system from scratch, applying patterns\nApply the principles of immutable architecture to your tools, including SQL databases, message queues, and the network protocols that you already use \nDiscover new tools that natively apply these principles \nWho This Book Is For\nSoftware architects and senior developers. It contains examples in SQL and languages such as JavaScript and C#.

Knuth"],"pages":"297","publication_date":"February 2025","description":"The Art of Computer Programming is a multivolume work on the analysis of algorithms and has long been recognized as the definitive description of classical computer science. The five volumes published to date--Volumes 1, 2, 3, 4A, and 4B--already comprise a unique and invaluable resource in programming theory and practice. Countless readers have spoken about the profound personal influence of Knuth's writings. Scientists have marveled at the beauty and elegance of his analysis, while practicing programmers have successfully applied his \"cookbook\" solutions to their day-to-day problems. All have admired Knuth for the breadth, clarity, accuracy, and good humor found in his books.\n\nTo continue the set, and to update parts of the existing volumes, Knuth has created a series of small books called fascicles, which are published at regular intervals. Each fascicle encompasses a section or more of wholly new or revised material. Ultimately, the content of these fascicles will be rolled up into the comprehensive, final versions of each volume, and the enormous undertaking that began in 1962 will be complete.\n\nVolume 4, Fascicle 7, which is brimming with lively examples, forms the first third of what will eventually become hardcover Volume 4C. It introduces and explores an important general framework for modeling and solving combinatorial problems, called the Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP). The concluding sections of Volume 4B contain expositions of two analogous frameworks, namely XCC (\"exact covering with colors\") and SAT (\"Boolean satisfiability\"); the XCC solvers and SAT solvers are now joined by CSP solvers, completing a powerful trio of techniques. Each member of the trio has its own strengths, while separately helping to understand the other two.\n\nThis fascicle illuminates how the CSP framework is tied to dozens of other parts of computer science: Scene analysis (computer vision); efficient algorithms that embed one graph in another; fascinating instances of \"graceful graphs\"; new ways to look ahead when backtracking; new heuristics to guide a search that backtracks through a massive space of possibilities; situations when backtracking isn't necessary.\n\nNew sparse-set data structures are introduced, leading to a technique called \"dancing cells\"--which often is even better than \"dancing links\"! Recreational topics appear throughout, including some new takes on the classic problem of a knight's tour, as well as modern puzzles such as fillomino.\n\nNearly 500 exercises are provided, arranged carefully for self-instruction, together with detailed answers (in fact, sometimes also with answers to the answers).

He looked into this new virtual money more than once and, each time, decided not to invest. Like many long-term investors, he was looking for fundamentals. Crypto had none — or so he thought. This book details why his perspective on cryptoassets has shifted – and why yours should, too.\n\nRecent developments in this field have turned crypto from a speculative financial innovation to a new asset class, one with a new kind of fundamentals that offer real economic value. One that will change finance and investments. One that may be a trigger defining the fourth industrial revolution, the same way steam, electricity, and the Internet were triggers for the first, second, and third industrial revolutions, respectively.\n\nDespite what advocates of the traditional financial establishmentlike to claim, cryptoassets were by far the best financial investment of the last decade, even risk-adjusted, and could still be so for the coming one. They should not be overlooked, regardless of one’s opinion of them.\n\nThis book answers the main questions any potential long-term investor in cryptoassets should ask:\n\nWhat are cryptoassets and blockchain technology?\nWhy consider cryptoasset investments?\nWhen is a good time to invest?\nWhere should one invest?\nHow should one invest?\nWhich valuation methods are appropriate?\n\nUnderstanding Crypto Fundamentals includes a deep dive into the management of risks specific to cryptoassets, both financial and non-financial, and provides the tools needed for investment success in this new asset class. Upon completing the book, you will have a new perspective on cryptoassets and how you can benefit from them as an investor.\nThomas Jeegers is a CFA Charterholder and Financial Risk Manager (FRM), and has earned an MBA from INSEAD as well as multiple blockchain certifications from institutions including INSEAD and Oxford University.

Macros make hard things possible and normal things easy. They can be tricky to use, and this book will help you deftly navigate the terrain. You'll discover how to write straightforward code that avoids duplication and clarifies your intentions. You'll learn how and why to write macros. You'll learn to recognize situations when using a macro would (and wouldn't!) be helpful. And you'll use macros to remove unnecessary code and build new language features.Clojure offers some sharp tools in its toolbox, and one of the sharpest is its macro system. This book will help you write macros using Clojure, and more importantly, recognize when you should be using macros in the first place.The Lisp \"code-as-data\" philosophy gives tremendous advantages to macro authors and users. You can use macros to evaluate code in other contexts, move computations to compile time, and create beautiful API layers. You don't need to wait on the Clojure language itself to add new features, you'll learn how to implement even the lowest-level features as macros. You'll step through representative samples of how to use macros in production libraries and applications, find clear details on how to construct macros, and learn pointers to avoid obstacles that often trip up macro amateurs.Clojure macros are more straightforward to use than metaprogramming features in many other languages, but they're different enough from normal programming to present challenges of their own. Mastering Clojure Macros examines some of these issues, along with alternatives to macros where they exist.By the time you finish this book, you'll be thinking like a macro professional.What You Need:The book examples have been developed under Clojure 1.6.0, although earlier and later versions of Clojure may work as well.

OK, so you want to become a terrible programmer. You want to write code that gets vigorously rejected in review. You look forward to reading feedback plastered in comments like \"WTF???\". Even better, you fantasize about your bug-ridden changes sneaking through and causing untold chaos in the codebase. You want to build a reputation as someone who writes creaky, messy, error-prone garbage that frustrates your colleagues. Bad Programming Practices 101 will help you achieve that goal a whole lot quicker by teaching you an array of bad habits that will allow you to cause maximumchaos.\nAlternatively, you could use this book to identify those bad habits and learn to avoid them. The bad practices are organized into topics that form the basis of programming (layout, variables, loops, modules, and so on). It's been remarked that to become a good programmer, you must first write 10,000 lines of bad code to get it all out of your system. This book is aimed at programmers who have so far written only a small portion of that. By learning about poor programming habits, you will learn good practices. In addition, you will find out the motivation behind each practice, so you can learn why it is considered good and not simply get a list of rules.\nWhat You'll Learn\nBecome a better coder by learning how (not) to program\nChoose your tools wisely\nThink of programming as problem solving\nDiscover the consequences of a program’s appearance and overall structure\nExplain poor use of variables in programs\nAvoid bad habits and common mistakes when using conditionals and loops\nSee how poor error-handling makes for unstable programs\nSidestep bad practices related specifically to object-oriented programming\nMitigate the effects of ineffectual and inadequate bug location and testing\nWho This Book Is For\nThose who have some practical programming knowledge (can program in at least one programming language), but little or no professional experience, which they would like to quickly build up. They are either still undergoing training in software development, or are at the beginning of their programming career. They have at most 1-2 years of professional experience.","tags":["Software Development","Coding Practices"]},{"id":"9781484244807","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Practical Haskell: A Real World Guide to Programming","authors":["Alejandro Serrano Mena"],"pages":"600","publication_date":"April 2019","description":"Get a practical, hands-on introduction to the Haskell language, its libraries and environment, and to the functional programming paradigm that is fast growing in importance in the software industry. This book contains excellent coverage of the Haskell ecosystem and supporting tools, include Cabal and Stack for managing projects, HUnit and QuickCheck for software testing, the Spock framework for developing web applications, Persistent and Esqueleto for database access, and parallel and distributed programming libraries.\n\nYou’ll see how functional programming is gathering momentum, allowing you to express yourself in a more concise way, reducing boilerplate, and increasing the safety of your code.

Today, Java servlets stand poised to take Java to the next level as a Web development language. The main reason is that servlets offer a fast, powerful, portable replacement for CGI scripts. The Java Servlet API, introduced as the first standard extension to Java, provides a generic mechanism to extend the functionality of any kind of server. Servlets are most commonly used, however, to extend Web servers, performing tasks traditionally handled by CGI programs. Web servers that can support servlets include: Apache, Netscape's FastTrack and Enterprise Servers, Microsoft's IIS, O'Reilly's WebSite, and JavaSoft's Java Web Server. The beauty of servlets is that they execute within the Web server's process space and they persist between invocations. This gives servlets tremendous performance benefits over CGI programs. Yet because they're written in Java, servlets are far less likely to crash a Web server than a C-based NSAPI or ISAPI extension. Servlets have full access to the various Java APIs and to third-party component classes, making them ideal for use in communicating with applets, databases, and RMI servers. Plus, servlets are portable between operating systems and between servers -- with servlets you can \"write once, serve everywhere.\" Java Servlet Programming covers everything you need to know to write effective servlets and includes numerous examples that you can use as the basis for your own servlets. The book explains the servlet life cycle, showing how you can use servlets to maintain state information effortlessly. It also describes how to serve dynamic Web content, including both HTML pages and multimedia data. Finally, it explores more advanced topics like integrated session tracking, efficient database connectivity using JDBC, applet-servlet communication, inter-servlet communication, and internationalization.","tags":["Software Development","Programming Languages","JVM Languages","Java"]},{"id":"0131345915","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"C# for Programmers, Second Edition","authors":["Harvey M.
