Mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, information engineering, mechatronics, electronics, bioengineering, computer engineering, control engineering, software engineering, mathematics, and other subjects are all included in robotics. Robots can be employed in a variety of scenarios and for a variety of objectives, but many are now being used in hazardous areas (such as radioactive material inspection, bomb detection, and deactivation), manufacturing operations, or in conditions where humans are unable to live (e.g. in space, underwater, in high heat, and clean up and containment of hazardous materials and radiation). Walking, lifting, speaking, cognition, and any other human activity are all attempted by robots. Many of today’s robots are influenced by nature, making bio-inspired robotics a growing area. Defusing explosives, seeking survivors in unstable ruins, and investigating mines and shipwrecks are just a few of the activities that robots are designed to undertake.\n\nThis groundbreaking new volume presents a Robotic Process Automation (RPA) software technique that makes it simple to create, deploy, and manage software robots that mimic human movements while dealing with digital systems and software. Software robots can interpret what’s on a screen, type the correct keystrokes, traverse systems, locate and extract data, and do a wide variety of predetermined operations, much like people.

The semiconductor industry is relying more on resolution enhancement techniques (RETs), since their implementation does not require significant changes in fabrication infrastructure. Computational Lithography is the first book to address the computational optimization of RETs in optical lithography, providing an in-depth discussion of optimal optical proximity correction (OPC), phase shifting mask (PSM), and off-axis illumination (OAI) RET tools that use model-based mathematical optimization approaches.\n\nThe book starts with an introduction to optical lithography systems, electric magnetic field principles, and the fundamentals of optimization from a mathematical point of view. It goes on to describe in detail different types of optimization algorithms to implement RETs. Most of the algorithms developed are based on the application of the OPC, PSM, and OAI approaches and their combinations. Algorithms for coherent illumination as well as partially coherent illumination systems are described, and numerous simulations are offered to illustrate the effectiveness of the algorithms. In addition, mathematical derivations of all optimization frameworks are presented.\n\nThe accompanying MATLAB® software files for all the RET methods described in the book make it easy for readers to run and investigate the codes in order to understand and apply the optimization algorithms, as well as to design a set of optimal lithography masks. The codes may also be used by readers for their research and development activities in their academic or industrial organizations. An accompanying MATLAB® software guide is also included. An accompanying MATLAB® software guide is included, and readers can download the software to use with the guide at ftp://ftp.wiley.com/public/sci_tech_med/computational_lithography.\n\nTailored for both entry-level and experienced readers, Computational Lithography is meant for faculty, graduate students, and researchers, as well as scientists and engineers in industrial organizations whose research or career field is semiconductor IC fabrication, optical lithography, and RETs. Computational lithography draws from the rich theory of inverse problems, optics, optimization, and computational imaging; as such, the book is also directed to researchers and practitioners in these fields.","tags":["Hardware","Embedded Systems","Microelectronics"]},{"id":"9781317590934","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Radio Production, 6th Edition","authors":["Robert McLeish","Jeff Link"],"pages":"418","publication_date":"September 2015","description":"Radio Production is for professionals and students interested in understanding the radio industry in today’s ever-changing world.

VOCAL is freely available from the Cisco Systems-sponsored Vovida.org community web site (www.vovida.org).\n\nA Silicon Valley start-up called Vovida Networks, Inc (think of VOice, VIdeo, DAta) created VOCAL and invested over one hundred man years into its development. Since Cisco acquired Vovida in 2000, individuals representing every significant telecom company and service provider in the world have downloaded the source code. Today, more and more people are successfully building VOCAL into professional solutions, while contributing fixes and new functionality back to Vovida.org.\n\nBecause VOCAL is open source, you can look \"under the hood\" to the base code and protocol stack levels and discover not only how the system works, but also how common problems are being worked out in the development environment. We're hoping that you will be inspired to take this system to another level by implementing a feature or functionality that no one has thought of before.\n\nWritten by a team from Vovida Networks, Practical VoIP Using VOCAL includes the following topics\n\nInstalling and configuring VOCAL 1.4.0 onto a single host and onto a multi-host network with phones and gateways\n\nC++, C and Java architecture found within VOCAL\n\nProvisioning a VoIP system\n\nSIP (Session Initiation Protocol), SDP (Session Description Protocol) and RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol) for call control and media\n\nTRIP (Telephony Routing over IP), DNS SRV and ENUM for routing\n\nMGCP (Media Gateway Control Protocol) and H.323 for call control and translation into SIP\n\nCOPS (Common Open Policy Service), OSP (Open Settlement Protocol) and RSVP (Reservation Protocol) for policy and Quality of Service\n\nRADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial In User Service) for interfacing with billing servers\n\nSNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)\n\nIf you're interested in VoIP, this is the only book available that focuses on the real issues facing programmers and administrators who need to work with these technologies.\n\n:","tags":["Hardware","Wireless Technology","Telecommunications","VoIP"]},{"id":"9781466563117","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"CMOS","authors":["Angelo Rivetti"],"pages":"726","publication_date":"September 2018","description":"This book offers a comprehensive introduction to the practical design and implementation of integrated front-end electronics for radiation detectors, providing specialized knowledge previously obtained only through the study of multiple technical and scientific papers.

Many businesses are also using their internal local and wide-area network infrastructure to replace legacy enterprise telephone networks. This migration to a single network carrying voice and data is called convergence, and it's revolutionizing the world of telecommunications by slashing costs and empowering users. The technology of families driving this convergence is called VoIP, or Voice over IP.\n\nVoIP has advanced Internet-based telephony to a viable solution, piquing the interest of companies small and large. The primary reason for migrating to VoIP is cost, as it equalizes the costs of long distance calls, local calls, and e-mails to fractions of a penny per use. But the real enterprise turn-on is how VoIP empowersbusinesses to mold and customize telecom and datacom solutions using a single, cohesive networking platform. These business drivers are so compelling that legacy telephony is going the way of the dinosaur, yielding to Voice over IP as the dominant enterprise communications paradigm.\n\nDeveloped from real-world experience by a senior developer, O'Reilly's Switching to VoIP provides solutions for the most common VoIP migration challenges. So if you're a network professional who is migrating from a traditional telephony system to a modern, feature-rich network, this book is a must-have. You'lldiscover the strengths and weaknesses of circuit-switched and packet-switched networks, how VoIP systems impact network infrastructure, as well as solutions for common challenges involved with IP voice migrations. Among the challenges discussed and projects presented:\n\nbuilding a softPBX\nconfiguring IP phones\nensuring quality of service\nscalability\nstandards-compliance\ntopological considerations\ncoordinating a complete system ?switchover?\nmigrating applications like voicemail and directoryservices\nretro-interfacing to traditional telephony\nsupporting mobile users\nsecurity and survivability\ndealing with the challenges of NAT\n\nTo help you grasp the core principles at work, Switching to VoIP uses a combination of strategy and hands-on \"how-to\" that introduce VoIP routers and media gateways, various makes of IP telephone equipment, legacy analog phones, IPTables and Linux firewalls, and the Asterisk open source PBX software by Digium.You'll learn how to build an IP-based or legacy-compatible phone system and voicemail system complete with e-mail integration while becoming familiar with VoIP protocols and devices. Switching to VoIP remains vendor-neutral and advocates standards, not brands. Some of the standards explored include:\n\nSIP\nH.323, SCCP, and IAX\nVoice codecs\n802.3af\nType of Service, IP precedence, DiffServ, and RSVP\n802.1a/b/g WLAN\n\nIf VoIP has your attention, like so many others, then Switching to VoIP will help you build your own system, install it, and begin making calls.

The cerebellum is now viewed as an assembly of numerous neuronal machine modules, each of which provides an implicit learning capability to various types of motor control. The cerebellum enables us to unconsciously learn motor skills through practice by forming internal models simulating control system properties of the body parts.\n\nBased on these remarkable advances in our understanding of motor control mechanisms of the cerebellum, Ito presents a still larger view of the cerebellum as serving a higher level of brain functions beyond movements, including the implicit part of the thought and cognitive processes that manipulate knowledge.

Cognitive radio technology integrates computational intelligence into software-defined radio for embedded intelligent agents that adapt to RF environments and user needs. Using this technology, users can more fully exploit the radio spectrum and services available from wireless connectivity. For example, an attempt to send a 10MB e-mail in a zone where carrier charges are high might cause a cognitive radio to alert its user and suggest waiting until getting to the office to use the LAN instead. Cognitive Radio Architecture examines an \"ideal cognitive radio\" that features autonomous machine learning, computer vision, and spoken or written language perception.\n\nThe author of this exciting new book is the inventor of the technology and a leader in the field. Following his step-by-step introduction, readers can start building aware/adaptive radios and then make steps towards cognitive radio.

As anyone with even a modicum of computer experience can attest, there are all types of hardware devices which you must become familiar with disk drives, printers, monitors, and sound cards, just to name a few. And, naturally, each is fraught with its own set of bugs and snares. PC Hardware Annoyances, the latest installment of O'Reilly's highly successful Annoyances series, aims to optimize these peripheral systems by offering easy fixes to their most annoying traits. With over 40 titles to his credit, author Stephen Bigelow identifies all those annoyances that make you cringe in frustration. Then, through the use of snappy, entertaining, and practical solutions, he shows you how to clear each obstacle one step at a time. After that, the rest is up to you. Designed for PC users of all levels, this handy guide doesn't bore you with long dissertations on the workings of the technology at hand. Instead, it offers straightforward, easy-to-understand troubleshooting solutions. For maximum ease of use, PC Hardware Annoyances is broken up into several broad hardware categories. They include desktops, laptops and PDAs, graphics, sound, hard drives, CD/DVD drives, network, and printers and scanners. And while you may not use each of these accessories currently, chances are it's only a matter of time before you'll need their technological services whether it's for work or recreation. What makes PC Hardware Annoyances especially timely is the growing trend among computer owners to simply upgrade their PCs as they age, rather than replacing them altogether. With peripheral devices becoming increasingly affordable, there's no reason not to. But as with any do-it-yourself project, trouble lurks around the corner if you don't have the right guide.

Author Dale Wheat shares his intimate knowledge of the Arduino board—its secrets, its strengths and possible alternatives to its constituent parts are laid open to scrutiny in this book. You'll learn to build new, improved Arduino boards and peripherals, while conforming to the Arduino reference design.\n\nArduino Internals begins by reviewing the current Arduino hardware and software landscape. In particular, it offers a clear analysis of how the ATmega8 board works and when and where to use its derivatives. The chapter on the \"hardware heart\" is vital for the rest of the book and should be studied in some detail.\n\nFurthermore, Arduino Internals offers important information about the CPU running the Arduino board, the memory contained within it and the peripherals mounted on it. To be able to write software that runs optimally on what is a fairly small embedded board, one must understand how the different parts interact. Later in the book, you'll learn how to replace certain parts with more powerful alternatives and how to design Arduino peripherals and shields.\n\nSince Arduino Internals addresses both sides of the Arduino hardware-software boundary, the author analyzes the compiler toolchain and again provides suggestions on how to replace it with something more suitable for your own purposes. You'll also learn about how libraries enable you to change the way Arduino and software interact, and how to write your own library implementing algorithms you've devised yourself. Arduino Internals also suggests alternative programming environments, since many Arduino hackers have a background language other than C or Java.\n\nOf course, it is possible to optimize the way in which hardware and software interact—an entire chapter is dedicated to this field.\n\nArduino Internals doesn't just focus on the different parts of Arduino architecture, but also on the ways in which example projects can take advantage of the new and improved Arduino board. Wheat employs example projects to exemplify the hacks and algorithms taught throughout the book.\n\nArduino projects straddling the hardware-software boundary often require collaboration between people of different talents and skills which cannot be taken for granted. For this reason, Arduino Internals contains a whole chapter dedicated to collaboration and open source cooperation to make those tools and skills explicit.\n\nOne of the crowning achievements of an Arduino hacker is to design a shield or peripheral residing on the Arduino board, which is the focus of the following chapter. A later chapter takes specialization further by examining Arduino protocols and communications, a field immediately relevant to shields and the communication between peripherals and the board.\n\nFinally, Arduino Internals integrates different skills and design techniques by presenting several projects that challenge you to put your newly-acquired skills to the test!","tags":["Hardware","Internet of Things (IoT)","Arduino"]},{"id":"9781118703175","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Smart Sensor Systems: Emerging Technologies and Applications","authors":["Kofi Makinwa","Michiel Pertijs","Gerard Meijer"],"pages":"296","publication_date":"June 2014","description":"With contributions from an internationally-renowned group of experts, this book uses a multidisciplinary approach to review recent developments in the field of smart sensor systems, covering important system and design aspects.

Organized around key crisis moments in the history of British colonial rule such as the ‘Black Hole’ of Calcutta, the anti-thug campaigns of the 1830s, the 1857 Rebellion, anti-colonial terrorism in Edwardian London and the Amritsar massacre in 1919, this timely book reveals how the terrorizing threat of violence mutually defined discursive relations between colonizer and colonized.\n\nBased on original research and drawing on theoretical work on sovereignty and the exception, this book examines Indian-English literary traditions in transaction and covers fiction and journalism by both colonial and Indian authors. It includes critical readings of several significant early Indian works for the first time: from neglected fictions such as Kylas Chunder Dutt’s story of anticolonial rebellion A Journal of Forty-Eight Hours of the Year 1945 (1835) and Sarath Kumar Ghosh’s nationalist epic The Prince of Destiny (1909) to dissident periodicals like Hurrish Chunder Mookerji’s Hindoo Patriot (1856–66) and Shyamaji Krishnavarma’s Indian Sociologist (1905–14). These are read alongside canonical works by metropolitan and ‘Anglo-Indian’ authors such as Philip Meadows Taylor’s Confessions of a Thug (1839), Rudyard Kipling’s short fictions, and novels by Edmund Candler and E. M. Forster. Reflecting on the wider cross-cultural politics of terror during the Indian independence struggle, Tickell also reappraises sacrificial violence in Indian revolutionary nationalism and locates Gandhi’s philosophy of ahimsa or non-violence as an inspired tactical response to the terror-effects of colonial rule.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","History"]},{"id":"9780415478557","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Sport, Culture and Society, 2nd Edition","authors":["Grant Jarvie"],"pages":"520","publication_date":"June 2013","description":"It is impossible to fully understand contemporary society and culture without acknowledging the place of sport.

Known as ``QP-unified motion planning and control of redundant manipulators'' theory, it systematically solves difficult optimization problems of inequality-constrained motion planning and control of redundant manipulators that have plagued robotics engineers and systems designers for more than a quarter century.    \n\nAn example of redundancy resolution could involve a robotic limb with six joints, or degrees of freedom (DOFs), with which to position an object. As only five numbers are required to specify the position and orientation of the object, the robot can move with one remaining DOF through practically infinite poses while performing a specified task. In this case redundancy resolution refers to the process of choosing an optimal pose from among that infinite set. A critical issue in robotic systems control, the redundancy resolution problem has been widely studied for decades, and numerous solutions have been proposed. This book investigates various approaches to motion planning and control of redundant robot manipulators and describes the most successful strategy thus far developed for resolving redundancy resolution problems. \n\nProvides a fully connected, systematic, methodological, consecutive, and easy approach to solving redundancy resolution problems\nDescribes a new approach to the time-varying Jacobian matrix pseudoinversion, applied to the redundant-manipulator kinematic control\nIntroduces The QP-based unification of robots' redundancy resolution\nIllustrates the effectiveness of the methods presented using a large number of computer simulation results based on PUMA560, PA10, and planar robot manipulators\nProvides technical details for all schemes and solvers presented, for readers to adopt and customize them for specific industrial applications \n\nRobot Manipulator Redundancy Resolution is must-reading for advanced undergraduates and graduate students of robotics, mechatronics, mechanical engineering, tracking control, neural dynamics/neural networks, numerical algorithms, computation and optimization, simulation and modelling, analog, and digital circuits.

Lumelsky"],"pages":"456","publication_date":"November 2005","description":"A leap forward in the field of robotics\n\nUntil now, most of the advances in robotics have taken place in structured environments. Scientists and engineers have designed highly sophisticated robots, but most are still only able to operate and move in predetermined, planned environments designed specifically for the robots and typically at very high cost. This new book takes robotics to the next level by setting forth the theory and techniques needed to achieve robotic motion in unstructured environments. The ability to move and operate in an arbitrary, unplanned environment will lead to automating a wide range of new robotic tasks, such as patient care, toxic site cleanup, and planetary exploration.\n\nThe approach that opens the door for robots to handle unstructured tasks is known as Sensing-Intelligence-Motion (SIM), which draws from research in topology, computational complexity, control theory, and sensing hardware. Using SIM as an underlying foundation, the author's carefully structured presentation is designed to:\n\nFormulate the challenges of sensor-based motion planning and then build a theoretical foundation for sensor-based motion planning strategies\n\nInvestigate promising algorithmic strategies for mobile robots and robot arm manipulators, in both cases addressing motion planning for the whole robot body\n\nCompare robot performance to human performance in sensor-based motion planning to gain better insight into the challenges of SIM and help build synergistic human-robot teams for tele-operation tasks. It is both exciting and encouraging to discover that robot performance decisively exceeds human performance in certain tasks requiring spatial reasoning, even when compared to trained operators\n\nReview sensing hardware that is necessary to realize the SIM paradigm\n\nSome 200 illustrations, graphic sketches, and photos are included to clarify key issues, develop and validate motion planning approaches, and demonstrate full systems in operation.\n\nAs the first book fully devoted to robot motion planning in unstructured environments, Sensing, Intelligence, Motion is a must-read for engineers, scientists, and researchers involved in robotics. It will help them migrate robots from highly specialized applications in factories to widespread use in society where autonomous robot motion is needed.","tags":["Hardware","Internet of Things (IoT)","Robotics"]},{"id":"9780133070316","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"HTML and CSS in 24 Hours, Sams Teach Yourself (Updated for HTML5 and CSS3), Ninth Edition","authors":["Julie C.

But there’s a key missing link: most businesses still connect to their service providers via old-fashioned, inflexible TDM trunks. Now, three Cisco® experts show how to use Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) trunking to eliminate legacy interconnects and gain the full benefits of end-to-end VoIP.\n\nWritten for enterprise decision-makers, network architects, consultants, and service providers, this book demystifies SIP trunking technology and trends and brings unprecedented clarity to the transition from TDM to SIP interconnects.  The authors separate the true benefits of SIP trunking from the myths and help you systematically evaluate and compare service provider offerings. You will find detailed cost analyses, including guidance on identifying realistic, achievable savings.\n\nSIP Trunking also introduces essential techniques for optimizing network design and security, introduces proven best practices for implementation, and shows how to apply them through a start-to-finish case study.\n\nChristina Hattingh, member of the technical staff in the Cisco Access Routing Technology Group (ARTG), has been involved with Cisco VoIP technologies from their inception and continues to consult and deliver training in these areas. Darryl Sladden, a Cisco Senior Product Manager, has been a key architect of the Cisco Unified Border Element and the Cisco SIP Trunking strategy as well as a key contributor to the AS5000 product, and several other Cisco VoIP technologies. ATM Zakaria Swapan, Cisco ARTG member of technical staff, has been a key contributor to the Cisco SIP development, Cisco Unified Border Element, VoIP Gateway, Secure Unified Communications, Wireless Voice, QoS & Call Admission Control and several other VoIP technologies.\n\n•  Discover the advanced Unified Communications solutions that SIP trunking facilitates\n\n•  Systematically plan and prepare your network for SIP trunking\n\n•  Generate effective RFPs for SIP trunking\n\n•  Ask service providers the right questions-–and make sense of their answers\n\n•  Compare SIP deployment models and assess their tradeoffs\n\n•  Address key network design issues, including security, call admission control, and call flows\n\n•  Manage SIP/TDM interworking throughout the transition\n\nThis IP communications book is part of the Cisco Press® Networking Technology Series.

Enron Ascending is the only book to date that examines in detail the first two-thirds of that iconic energy company’s life. Thus, it is the only book to date that exposes the deepest causes of Enron’s stunning collapse. Nobel economist Paul Krugman predicted that history would look upon Enron’s plummet as a greater turning point than the fall of the Twin Towers.\n\nEnron Ascending explains the shock of the company’s fall by recalling the astounding achievements of Enron’s birth, childhood, adolescence, and early maturity. It sets forth the once-celebrated but now-forgotten industry and innovation that caused the company and its reputation to soar stratospherically. At the same time, always conscious of the company’s fate, the book highlights throughout the developing habits of thought and behavior that later evolved into self-destructive acts of desperation and deceit.\n\nWritten fifteen years after the firm’s demise, Enron Ascending offers the long perspective of a uniquely positioned insider, Robert L. Bradley, Jr., the company’s director of public-policy analysis and Chairman Ken Lay’s personal speechwriter. The book also offers a library of previously unavailable information, drawn from Bradley’s innumerable corporate documents and unrepeatable interviews, which he collected in his capacity as the company’s prospective historian.\n\nMost important, however, Enron Ascending offers an antidote to the unending stories, studies, and books about Enron that are presented as just-the-facts but are in reality shaped decisively by the worldview of their authors. Bradley shows, beyond dispute, that the early habits which set precedents for Enron’s history-making demise were directly contrary to the free-market behaviors and capitalist attitudes generally blamed for Enron’s fall.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","History"]},{"id":"9781457185366","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"The LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 Discovery Book (Full Color)","authors":["Laurens Valk"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"June 2014","description":"The LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 Discovery Book is a complete beginner's guide to the EV3 kit from bestselling author and robotics expert Laurens Valk.","tags":["Hardware","Internet of Things (IoT)","Lego Mindstorms"]},{"id":"9781782175339","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Mastering Hibernate","authors":["Ramin Rad"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"May 2016","description":"Mastering Hibernate is your comprehensive guide to understanding and mastering Hibernate, a powerful Object-Relational Mapping tool for Java and .Net applications.

We also make sure you're up to date by using the latest HTML5 features. Planning is vital, so you'll also learn to use techniques such as brainstorming, wireframes, mockups, and prototypes to get your project off to the best possible start and help ensure smooth progress as it develops.\n\nAn understanding of correct, semantic markup is essential for any web professional; this book explains how HTML5 should be used to structure content so that the markup adheres to current web standards. You'll learn about the wide range of HTML5 elements available to you, and you'll learn how and when to use them through building example web pages.\n\nWithout creative use of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), websites would all look largely the same. CSS enables you to set your website apart from the rest, while maintaining the integrity of your markup. We'll showcase the new features of CSS3 and how you can use them. You'll learn how CSS3 works and how to apply styles to your pages, allowing you to realize your design ideas in the browser.\n\nJavaScript can be used to make your website easier and more interesting to use. This book provides information on appropriate uses of this technology and introduces the concepts of JavaScript programming. You'll also see how JavaScript works as part of the much-hyped technique Ajax, and in turn, where Ajax fits into the wider Web 2.0 picture.\n\nWhile a website is being built, it needs to be tested across multiple browsers and platforms to ensure that the site works for all users, regardless of ability or disability, and this book explains how best to accomplish these tasks. Then, it discusses the process of launching and maintaining the site so that it will continue to work for all its users throughout its life cycle.\n\nFoundation Website Creation with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript concludes by covering server-side technologies, acting as a guide to the different options available. With insights from renowned experts such as Jason Fried of 37signals, Daniel Burka of Digg and Pownce, and Chris Messina of Citizen Agency, Foundation Website Creation with CSS, XHTML, and JavaScript provides invaluable information applicable to every web project—regardless of size, scope, or budget.\n\nWhat you'll learn\n\nSee how the Web has developed and the role of web standards\n\nLearn how to plan and manage the building of a website\n\nLearn how to separate content from presentation with HTML5 and CSS3\n\nSee how JavaScript can be used to enhance your website\n\nLearn how best to test, launch, and maintain a website\n\nWho this book is for\n\nWeb developers and designers starting out in HTML5 and CSS3.","tags":["Web & Mobile","Web Development","Frontend Web Development","HTML"]},{"id":"9780071772693","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"101 Spy Gadgets for the Evil Genius 2/E, 2nd Edition","authors":["Brad Graham","Kathy McGowan"],"pages":"384","publication_date":"October 2011","description":"CREATE FIENDISHLY FUN SPY TOOLS AND COUNTERMEASURES\n\nFully updated throughout, this wickedly inventive guide is packed with a wide variety of stealthy sleuthing contraptions you can build yourself. 101 Spy Gadgets for the Evil Genius, Second Edition also shows you how to reclaim your privacy by targeting the very mechanisms that invade your space.

The analysis of biological neural systems, especially for visual processing, has allowed engineers to better understand how complex networks can effectively process large amounts of information, whilst dealing with difficult computational challenges.\n\nAnalog and parallel processing are key characteristics of biological neural networks. Analog VLSI circuits using the same features can therefore be developed to emulate brain-style processing. Using standard CMOS technology, they can be cheaply manufactured, permitting efficient industrial and consumer applications in robotics and mobile electronics.\n\nThis book explores the theory, design and implementation of analog VLSI circuits, inspired by visual motion processing in biological neural networks. Using a novel approach pioneered by the author himself, Stocker explains in detail the construction of a series of electronic chips, providing the reader with a valuable practical insight into the technology.\n\nAnalog VLSI Circuits for the Perception of Visual Motion:\n\nanalyses the computational problems in visual motion perception;\n\nexamines the issue of optimization in analog networks through high level processes such as motion segmentation and selective attention;\n\ndemonstrates network implementation in analog VLSI CMOS technology to provide computationally efficient devices;\n\nsets out measurements of final hardware implementation;\n\nillustrates the similarities of the presented circuits with the human visual motion perception system;\n\nincludes an accompanying website with video clips of circuits under real-time visual conditions and additional supplementary material.\n\nWith a complete review of all existing neuromorphic analog VLSI systems for visual motion sensing, Analog VLSI Circuits for the Perception of Visual Motion is a unique reference for advanced students in electrical engineering, artificial intelligence, robotics and computational neuroscience.

Hardware is simple–there are only a few things you need to set up and shoot an HDR series. Software is vastly improved, making it easier for anyone to create an HDR image. The hard part is the post-processing technique. There are only two options: hours and hours of experimentation or The HDR Book. Featuring real-world interviews with passionate HDR photographers, this updated edition of the popular The HDR Book, by Rafael “RC” Concepcion, is more than a how-to and different from any other HDR book out there. While other books on HDR tend to lean toward the esoteric or formulaic, this book takes another approach. It's a complete and total HDR workshop that teaches you the one thing that most other books miss— once you've tone mapped your image with HDR software, you're still not finished. Within the pages of this book, you'll find 10 projects–now updated!–shot with everything from a point-and-shoot to a 37-megapixel, medium-format camera. The projects are designed to show you how the subtle differences in each scenario (lighting, subject, environment, etc.) dictate the post-processing needed to achieve one of the many final looks covered. You'll learn not only the different tone map settings RC used, but you’ll also learn the final steps taken in Photoshop to complete each image. Then, you'll recreate these looks your self using the exact same RAW files that RC used! Plus, you get four bonus images to play with and create your own look. The end result: a more intrinsic understanding of the nuances of HDR that will help you create the images you’ve always wanted. Best of all, The HDR Book is written using the three top HDR processing programs in the industry today: Photoshop’s HDR Pro, Photomatix Pro, and HDR Efex Pro.

In recent decades, cognitive radio-based networks have garnered increased attention and have been well studied to overcome the problem of spectrum scarcity in future wireless communications systems. Many new challenges in resource allocation appear in cognitive radio-based networks. This book focuses on effective resource allocation solutions in several important cognitive radio-based networks, including opportunistic spectrum access networks, cooperative sensing networks, cellular networks, high-speed vehicle networks, and smart grids.\n\nCognitive radio networks are composed of cognitive, spectrum-agile devices capable of changing their configuration on the fly based on the spectral environment. This capability makes it possible to design flexible and dynamic spectrum access strategies with the purpose of opportunistically reusing portions of the spectrum temporarily vacated by licensed primary users. Different cognitive radio-based networks focus on different network resources, such as transmission slots, sensing nodes, transmission power, white space, and sensing channels.\n\nThis book introduces several innovative resource allocation schemes for different cognitive radio-based networks according to their network characteristics:\n\nOpportunistic spectrum access networks\n– Introduces a probabilistic slot allocation scheme to effectively allocate the transmission slots to secondary users to maximize throughput\nCooperative sensing networks\n– Introduces a new adaptive collaboration sensing scheme in which the resources of secondary users are effectively utilized to sense the channels for efficient acquisition of spectrum opportunities\nCellular networks\n– Introduces a framework of cognitive radio-assisted cooperation for downlink transmissions to allocate transmission modes, relay stations, and transmission power/sub-channels to secondary users to maximize throughput\nHigh-speed vehicle networks\n– Introduces schemes to maximize the utilized TV white space through effective allocation of white space resources to secondary users\nSmart grids\n– Introduces effective sensing channel allocation strategies for acquiring enough available spectrum channels for communications between utility and electricity consumers","tags":["Hardware","Wireless Technology","Telecommunications","Radio","Cognitive Radio"]},{"id":"9780123743435","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Three-dimensional Integrated Circuit Design","authors":["Vasilis F.

From the 1880s to the 1960s, protagonists of the Greater India theme attempted to make a case for the importance of an expansionist Indian civilisation in civilizing Southeast Asia. The argument was extended to include Central Asia, Africa, North and South America, and other regions where Indian migrants were to be found. The advocates of this Indocentric and Hindu revivalist approach, with Hindu and Indian often taken to be synonymous, were involved in a quintessentially parochial project, despite its apparently international dimensions: to justify an Indian expansionist imagination that viewed India’s past as a colonizer and civilizer of other lands as a model for the restoration of that past greatness in the future. Zabarskaite shows that the crucial ideologues and elements used for the formation of the construct of Greater India can be traced to the svadeśī movement of the turn of the century, and that Greater India moved easily between the domains of the scholarly and the popular as it sought to establish itself as a form of nationalist self-assertion.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","History"]},{"id":"9780132178655","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Seasonal Gift Strategies for Spending Smart","authors":["Gregory Karp"],"pages":"8","publication_date":"June 2010","description":"This Element is an excerpt from Living Rich by Spending Smart: How to Get More of What You Really Want (ISBN: 9780132350099) by Gregory Karp.

As a response to this scholarly desideratum, this pioneering study analyzes neoconservative images of Europe since the 1970s on the basis of an extensive collection of sources. With fresh insight into the evolution of American images of Europe as well as into the history of U.S. neoconservatism, the book appeals to readers familiar and new to the subject matters alike. The study explores how, beginning in the early 1970s, ideas of the United States as an anti-Europe have permeated neoconservative writing and shaped their self-images and political agitation. The choice of periodization and investigated personnel enables the author to refute popular claims that widespread Euro-critical sentiment in the United Studies during the early 21st century – considerably ignited by neoconservatives – was a distinct post-Cold War phenomenon. Instead, the analysis reveals that the fiery rhetoric in the context of the Iraq War debates was merely the climax of a decade-old development.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","History"]},{"id":"53863MIT58419","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Supply Chains Built for Speed and Customization","authors":["ManMohan S Sodhi","Christopher S.

What if they hadn't been?\n\nConsider the most famous music group in history. What would the world be like if the Beatles never existed? This was the question posed by the playful, thought-provoking, 2019 film Yesterday, in which a young, completely unknown singer starts performing Beatles hits to a world that has never heard them. Would the Fab Four's songs be as phenomenally popular as they are in our own Beatle-infused world? The movie asserts that they would, but is that true? Was the success of the Beatles inevitable due to their amazing, matchless talent?\n\nMaybe. It's hard to imagine our world without its stars, icons, and celebrities. They are part of our culture and history, seeming permanent and preordained. But as Harvard law professor (and passionate Beatles fan) Cass Sunstein shows in this startling book, that is far from the case. Focusing on both famous and forgotten (or simply overlooked) artists and luminaries in music, literature, business, science, politics, and other fields, he explores why some individuals become famous and others don't and offers a new understanding of the roles played by greatness, luck, and contingency in the achievement of fame.\n\nSunstein examines recent research on informational cascades, network effects, and group polarization to probe the question of how people become famous. He explores what ends up in the history books and in the literary canon and how that changes radically over time. He delves into the rich and entertaining stories of a diverse cast of famous characters, from John Keats, William Blake, and Jane Austen to Bob Dylan, Ayn Rand, and Stan Lee—as well as John, Paul, George, and Ringo.\n\nHow to Become Famous takes you on a fun, captivating, and at times profound journey that will forever change your perspective on the latest celebrity's \"fifteen minutes of fame\" and on what vaults some to the top—and leaves others in the dust.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","History"]},{"id":"9781680457278","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Robot Magic","authors":["Mario Marchese"],"pages":"240","publication_date":"September 2021","description":"Learn robotics through magic, or enhance your magic with robotics!

Arduinos can be expanded to have network capabilities with a variety of “shields,” all of which increase the cost and complexity of the system. By contrast, Raspberry Pis all run Linux, which is a very network-competent platform. The newest Pi, the Raspberry Pi Zero W,  is WiFi and Bluetooth capable, and costs around $10 U.S. For network enabled gadgets, it makes far more sense to cross to the Raspberry PI platform, if only someone would make it easy to do.

You'll see that several projects use and explain the WiringPi system. This is is deliberately similar to the Arduino's 'Wiring' functionality, which is how sketches interact with GPIO pins. You'll learn the differences between the GPIO pins of the two devices, and how the Pi has some limitations on those pins that the Arduino does not. As a final project, in an effort to escape some of those limitations, you'll attach an AtMEGA 328P to the Raspberry Pi and configure it as a real, 8MHz Arduino with the Arduino IDE running on the Pi, and learn how to have the two platforms communicate, giving you the best of both worlds.\nWhat You'll Learn\nEstablish security with Linux system administration\nSet up the Apache webserver\nWrite CGI programs so other computers can connect to your Pi and pull datain from it. \nUse C/C++ from Arduino sketches to write programs for the Pi   \nWho This Book Is For \nThe Arduino user who's been through all the tutorials and is comfortable writing sketches and connecting hardware to their Arduino.","tags":["Hardware","Internet of Things (IoT)","Single Board Computers","Raspberry Pi"]},{"id":"9781398601239","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Managing Workplace Health and Wellbeing during a Crisis","authors":["Cary Cooper","Ian Hesketh"],"pages":"200","publication_date":"January 2022","description":"Use the expert advice and global case studies in this book to support employee health and wellbeing both during and after a health, economic or social crisis.","tags":["Travel & Hobbies","Health & Fitness","Health"]},{"id":"9781562865276","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Engage Your Brain for Learning","authors":["Bob Lucas"],"pages":"16","publication_date":"August 2008","description":"Brain-based or brain-compatible learning theory focuses on creating a learning program in which attainment, retention, recollection, and use of information is maximized through actively stimulating and engaging the brains of learners.

When two or more processors request access to a common resource, such as a memory, an arbiter has to decide which request to deal with first. Current developments in integrated circuit processing are leading to an increase in the numbers of independent digital processing elements in a single system. With this comes faster communications, more networks on chip, and the demand for more reliable, more complex, and higher performance synchronizers and arbiters. Written by one of the foremost researchers in this area of digital design, this authoritative text provides in-depth theory and practical design solutions for the reliable working of synchronization and arbitration hardware in digital systems.\n\nThe book provides methods for making real reliability measurements both on and off chip, evaluating some of the common difficulties and detailing circuit solutions at both circuit and system levels.

It is present today in most electronic devices. Knowing its internal mechanisms and programming is essential for the electronics engineer and computer scientist to understand and master the operation of a computer and advanced concepts of programming. This first volume focuses more particularly on the first generations of microprocessors, that is to say those that handle integers in 4 and 8-bit formats. The first chapter presents the calculation function and reminds the memory function. The following is devoted to notions of calculation model and architecture. The concept of bus is then presented. Chapters 4 and 5 can then address the internal organization and operation of the microprocessor first in hardware and then software. The mechanism of the function call, conventional and interrupted, is more particularly detailed in a separate chapter. The book ends with a presentation of architectures of the first microcomputers for a historical perspective.\n\nThe knowledge is presented in the most exhaustive way possible with examples drawn from current and old technologies that illustrate and make accessible the theoretical concepts.

For example, you'll meet Jeri Ellsworth, who might provide a video lecture on magnetic logic one day and a tutorial on welding a roll bar on a stock car the next. You'll also meet Eben Upton, who put cheap, powerful computing in the hands of everyone with the Raspberry Pi; Becky Stern, who jazzes up clothing with sensors and LEDs; and bunnie Huang, who knows the ins and outs of the Shenzhen, China, electronics parts markets as well as anyone. As all the interviews in Makers at Work show, makers have something in common: reverence for our technical past coupled with an aversion to convention. If they can't invent new processes or products, it's simply not worth doing.\n\nCrazy as foxes, makers—working in the spirit of Tesla, Wozniak, Edison, Gates, Musk and many others—can bring sophisticated products to the people or to the market as fast or faster than large corporations.

Bailey"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"August 2011","description":"Dr Donald Bailey starts with introductory material considering the problem of embedded image processing, and how some of the issues may be solved using parallel hardware solutions. Field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are introduced as a technology that provides flexible, fine-grained hardware that can readily exploit parallelism within many image processing algorithms. A brief review of FPGA programming languages provides the link between a software mindset normally associated with image processing algorithms, and the hardware mindset required for efficient utilization of a parallel hardware design. The design process for implementing an image processing algorithm on an FPGA is compared with that for a conventional software implementation, with the key differences highlighted. Particular attention is given to the techniques for mapping an algorithm onto an FPGA implementation, considering timing, memory bandwidth and resource constraints, and efficient hardware computational techniques. Extensive coverage is given of a range of low and intermediate level image processing operations, discussing efficient implementations and how these may vary according to the application. The techniques are illustrated with several example applications or case studies from projects or applications he has been involved with. Issues such as interfacing between the FPGA and peripheral devices are covered briefly, as is designing the system in such a way that it can be more readily debugged and tuned.\n\nProvides a bridge between algorithms and hardware\n\nDemonstrates how to avoid many of the potential pitfalls\n\nOffers practical recommendations and solutions\n\nIllustrates several real-world applications and case studies\n\nAllows those with software backgrounds to understand efficient hardware implementation\n\nDesign for Embedded Image Processing on FPGAs is ideal for researchers and engineers in the vision or image processing industry, who are looking at smart sensors, machine vision, and robotic vision, as well as FPGA developers and application engineers.\n\nThe book can also be used by graduate students studying imaging systems, computer engineering, digital design, circuit design, or computer science.

Ghosn spent two decades building a colossal partnership between Nissan and Renault that looked like a new model for a global business, but the alliance's shiny image fronted an unsteady, tense operation. Culture clashes, infighting among executives and engineers, dueling corporate traditions, and government maneuvering constantly threatened the venture.\n\nJournalists Hans Greimel and William Sposato have followed the story up close, with access to key players, including Ghosn himself. Veteran Tokyo-based reporters, they have witnessed the end of Japan's bubble economy and attempts at opening Japan Inc. to the world. They've seen the fraying of keiretsu, Japan's traditional skein of business relationships, and covered numerous corporate scandals, of which the Ghosn Shock and Ghosn's subsequent escape stand above all.\n\nExpertly reported, Collision Course explores the complex suspicions around what and who was really responsible for Ghosn's ouster and why one of the top executives in the world would risk everything to escape the country. It explains how economics, history, national interests, cultural politics, and hubris collided, crumpling the legacy of arguably the most important foreign businessman ever to set foot in Japan.\n\nThis gripping, unforgettable narrative, full of fascinating characters, serves as part cautionary tale, part object lesson, and part forewarning of the increasing complexity of doing global business in a nationalistic world.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","History"]},{"id":"9781491975602","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Hardware by the Numbers: Startups","authors":["Renee DiResta"],"pages":"20","publication_date":"June 2015","description":"Hardware startups leveled off in 2014 after sharp increases the previous two years, but there's no sign that IoT products have lost their luster, given their momentum in key economic sectors from health and energy to agriculture and financial services.

Leaders and institutions of every kind--public and private, large and small--must compete in the marketplace of images and messages. This has been true since the advent of mass media, from broad circulation magazines and radio through the age of television and the internet. Yet there have been very few true geniuses at the art of mass persuasion in the last century. In public relations, Edward Bernays comes to mind. In advertising, most Hall-of-Famers--J. Walter Thomson, David Ogilvy, Bill Bernbach, Bruce Barton, Ray Rubicam, and others--point to one individual as the \"father\" of modern advertising: Albert D. Lasker. And yet Lasker--unlike Bernays, Thomson, Ogilvy, and the others--remains an enigma. Now, Jeffrey Cruikshank and Arthur Schultz, having uncovered a treasure trove of Lasker's papers, have written a fascinating and revealing biography of one of the 20th century's most powerful, intriguing, and instructive figures. It is no exaggeration to say that Lasker created modern advertising. He was the first influential proponent of \"reason why\" advertising, a consumer-centered approach that skillfully melded form and content and a precursor to the \"unique selling proposition\" approach that today dominates the industry. More than that, he was a prominent political figure, champion of civil rights, man of extreme wealth and hobnobber with kings and maharajahs, as well as with the likes of Albert Einstein and Eleanor Roosevelt. He was also a deeply troubled man, who suffered mental collapses throughout his adult life, though was able fight through and continue his amazing creative and productive activities into later life.This is the story of a man who shaped an industry, and in many ways, shaped a century.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","History"]},{"id":"9781787286429","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Intelligent IoT Projects in 7 Days","authors":["Agus Kurniawan"],"pages":"206","publication_date":"September 2017","description":"Intelligent IoT Projects in 7 Days is your go-to guide for building smart IoT projects within a short timeframe.

Hibernate:A Developer's Notebook is for you. Database experts may enjoy fiddling with SQL, but you don't have to--the rest of the application is the fun part. And even database experts dread the tedious plumbing and typographical spaghetti needed to put their SQL into a Java program. Hibernate: A Developers Notebook shows you how to use Hibernate to automate persistence: you write natural Java objects and some simple configuration files, and Hibernate automates all the interaction between your objects and the database. You don't even need to know the database is there, and you can change from one database to another simply by changing a few statements in a configuration file. Hibernate: A Developer's Notebook walks you through the ins and outs of using Hibernate, from installation and configuration, to complex associations and composite types. Two chapters explore ways to write sophisticated queries, which you can express either through a pure Java API, or with an SQL-inspired, but object-oriented, query language. Don't let that intimidate you though: one of the biggest surprises in working with Hibernate is that for many of the common real-world application scenarios, you don't need an explicit query at all. If you've needed to add a database backend to your application, don't put it off. It's much more fun than it used to be, and Hibernate: A Developer's Notebook shows you why. Here's what a few reviewers had to say: \"I'm sitting on an airplane after finishing Hibernate: A Developer's Notebook. It's rare to find a book on a new Java technology that you can get through on a domestic flight. That this notebook effectively and succinctly tackles object-relational mapping makes it, and Hibernate, even more impressive. Many books in this category would need to be checked luggage. With this book, you travel first class.\" --Mike Clark \"A simple persistence framework deserves a simple book, and this one delivers. The examples are well described and easy to understand, yet sophisticated enough to demonstrate Hibernate in a real-world context. Jim, I'm a new fan.\" --Bruce Tate About the new Developer's Notebook Series from O'Reilly: Developer's Notebooks are a new book series covering important new tools for software developers.

Network providers and major companies are thus investigating how this emerging technology can be implemented, and at what cost and savings, in their organizations. This book provides a comprehensive practical overview of the technology behind Internet Telephony, giving essential information to IT professionals who need to understand the background and explore the issues involved in migrating the existing telephony infrastructure to an IP based real time communication service. Assuming a working knowledge of IP and ISDN networking, it addresses the technical aspects of real-time applications over IP, with an in-depth coverage of voice and video applications and protocols. Drawing on their extensive research and practical development experience in VoIP from its earliest stages, the authors give you access to all the relevant standards and cutting-edge techniques in a single resource. IP Telephony is organized into three clearly structured sections, focusing on protocols, voice technology and networks with a step-by-step approach.

For such applications, the crucial bottleneck in the engineering process tends to shift from physical boundaries to controller generation. As an attempt to automatize this process, Evolutionary Robotics has successfully been used to generate robotic controllers of various types. However, a major challenge of the field remains the evolution of truly complex behavior. Furthermore, automatically created controllers often lack analyzability which makes them useless for safety-critical applications. In this book, a simple controller model based on Finite State Machines is proposed which allows a straightforward analysis of evolved behaviors. To increase the model's evolvability, a procedure is introduced which, by adapting the genotype-phenotype mapping at runtime, efficiently traverses both the behavioral search space as well as (recursively) the search space of genotype-phenotype mappings. Furthermore, a data-driven mathematical framework is proposed which can be used to calculate the expected success of evolution in complex environments.","tags":["Hardware","Internet of Things (IoT)","Robotics"]},{"id":"9781484213773","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Raspberry Pi IoT Projects: Prototyping Experiments for Makers","authors":["John C.

The result has been job insecurity for millions of workers, debts as far as the eye can see, and a dangerous quest for global domination. Democracy itself has been undermined and the Constitution weakened. This regime must be overturned! And, as Charles Derber demonstrates in his provocative new book, it can be. After all, Derber points out, there have been other corporate regimes in American history, although this latest version is by far the most extreme. Still, the corporate regimes of the Gilded Age and Roaring Twenties were overturned. To create regime change again, it will require bold, creative strategies, uniting progressives and conservatives in a new politics, which Derber outlines in detail. Regime Change Begins at Home exposes the many lies the corporate regime has used to maintain itself throughout its history, from the Cold War to the Iraq war, with a particular emphasis on how the Bush administration has cynically sought to, as Condelezza Rice once put it, \"capitalize on the opportunities\" presented by 9/11. Derber reveals how the Bush administration has used the so-called \"war on terror\" to frighten and distract the public. But regime change is possible. In Part III, Derber lays out the vision of a new regime, describing the social movements now fighting to achieve it, and the major new political realignment-one spanning the traditional conservative-liberal divide-that can make it happen. Derber does not minimize the difficulty of the task ahead, but he offers hope and specific, sophisticated, often surprising advice for defeating the regime and returning America to its citizens.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","History"]},{"id":"9781631571732","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Leading Adaptive Teams in Healthcare Organizations","authors":["Kurt C.

We show you how to use these PCs in sheep's clothing to be king of your domain (or at least the area immediately surrounding your recliner).\n\nLike the plot from a circa 1950's sci-fi film, computerized look-alikes have surreptitiously replaced our VCRs, our video game consoles...even our televisions and stereos. While the advantages that these digital entertainment devices (DEDs) offer over their analog predecessors are immense - so is the potential for sensory and information overload. Unlike the benign appliances we grew up with, these new digital wonders demand much more from us than the simple ability to turn them on and off. It's time to take control, put them through their paces, show them who's boss.\n\nThe revolution in your living roomThe same forces that revolutionized the workplace during the past 25 years are now at work in our homes. The PCs in our dens were only the forerunners of this computer revolution. The real fireworks are taking place in the living room, where computers hidden inside our everyday appliances are poised to transform the way we live.

This process involves much more than just technical knowledge, and this book provides you with all the information you'll need to understand the concepts behind designing and developing for the Web, as well as the best means to deliver professional, best-practice-based results.\n\nThere is far more to building a successful website than knowing a little Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). The process starts long before any coding takes place, and this book introduces you to the agile development process, explaining why this method makes so much sense for web projects and how best to implement it. Planning is vital, so you'll also learn how to use techniques such as brainstorming, wireframes, mockups, and prototypes to get your project off to the best possible start and help ensure smooth progress as it develops.\n\nAn understanding of correct, semantic markup is essential to any web professional, so this book explains how XHTML should be used to structure content so that the markup adheres to current web standards. You'll learn about the wide range of HTML elements available to you, and you'll learn how and when to use them through building example web pages.\n\nWithout creative use of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), websites would all look largely the same. CSS gives you the ability to set your website apart from the rest while maintaining the integrity of your markup. You'll learn how CSS works and how to apply styles to your pages, enabling you to realize your design ideas in the browser.\n\nJavaScript can be used to make your website easier and more interesting to use. This book provides information on appropriate uses of this technology and introduces the concepts of programming using it. You'll also see how JavaScript works as part of the much-hyped technique Ajax and in turn where Ajax fits into the wider Web 2.0 picture.\n\nWhile a website is being built, it needs to be tested across multiple browsers and platforms to ensure that the site works for all users, regardless of ability or disability, and the book explains how best to do these tasks. Then, it discusses the process of launching and maintaining the site so that it will continue to work for all its users throughout its life-cycle.\n\nThe book concludes by covering server-side technologies, acting as a guide to the different options available and explaining differences between available products. With insights from renowned experts such as Jason Fried of 37signals, Daniel Burka of Digg and Pownce, and Chris Messina of Citizen Agency, this book provides invaluable information applicable to every web project, regardless of size, scope, or budget.","tags":["Web & Mobile","Web Development","Frontend Web Development","HTML"]},{"id":"9780240818856","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Building Websites with HTML5 to Work with Mobile Phones","authors":["Matthew David"],"pages":"53","publication_date":"February 2013","description":"The goal of this ebook is to introduce you to mobile Web development.

The Balkans has become synonymous with chaos and extremism. Balkanization, meaning conflict arising from the fragmentation of political power, is a condition feared across the globe. This new text assesses the key issues of Balkan politics, showing how the development of exclusive nationalism has prevented the region’s human and material resources from being harnessed in a constructive way.\n\nIt argues that the proximity of the Balkans to the great powers is the main reason for instability and decline. Britain, Russia, Austria-Hungary, France and finally the USA had conflicting ambitions and interests in the region. Russia had imperial designs before and after the 1917 Revolution. The Western powers sometimes tolerated these or encouraged undemocratic local forces to exercise control in order to block further Soviet expansion.\n\nLeading authority Tom Gallagher examines the origins of these Western prejudices towards the Balkans, tracing the damaging effects of policies based on Western lethargy and cynicism, and reassesses the negative image of the region, its citizens, their leadership skills and their potential to overcome crucial problems.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","History"]},{"id":"01120100009SI","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Listening to the Rumrunners","authors":["David P.

Wheeler, a correspondent for the Religious News Service, wrote letters from Prague to her friends in the USA from 1947 to 1957. Her husband, George Shaw Wheeler, was a colonel in the US Army and the chief of the de-Nazification section of the Manpower Division of the Office of the Military Government (OMGUS). While in Germany in 1946, Wheeler’s contract was not renewed, mainly due to suspicions that he was disloyal to the US government and had connections to the communist movement. Afterwards the entire family moved to Prague, where in 1951 they applied for political asylum.\n\nThe correspondence depicts ten years of life in Czechoslovakia—from the rise of communism through high Stalinism to the de-Stalinization of the country—from the perspective of pro-Communist–minded Americans. Thematically, the correspondence covers a wide range of political, cultural, and social topics, including the Cold War, the Korean War, the role of Christians in mediating dialogue between East and West, McCarthyism, and topics focused on the internal politics of Czechoslovakia.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","History"]},{"id":"9780080492230","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Real Time UML Workshop for Embedded Systems","authors":["Bruce Powel Douglass"],"pages":"432","publication_date":"April 2011","description":"This practical new book provides much-needed, practical, hands-on experience capturing analysis and design in UML.

The appeal of additive manufacturing is its potential to reduce the need for expensive materials and energy, cut lead times, and make supply chains more efficient. Despite the promise of additive manufacturing, the authors argue, near-term expectations are overblown. Based on dozens of interviews, study of the literature on the history of materials and process technologies, industry meetings, and factory visits, they have identified three myths that need to be dispelled. The first myth is that additive manufacturing will allow producers to make parts of any complexity as easily and economically as parts that are manufactured in traditional ways (in other words, that it will make complexity “free”). The second myth is that additive manufacturing will prod manufacturing to become local. And the third myth is that additive manufacturing will allow producers to replace mass manufacturing with mass customization. In the authors’ view, none of these expectations is likely to be realized in the next few decades.Although the authors say that additive manufacturing will make it easier to design lighter parts with complex geometries and internal cavities, they point to important drawbacks and restrictions. Knowing the parameters of what’s possible to produce requires skills that are currently scarce. There are also safety and technical issues. Some of the safety concerns stem from the fact that the technology is new. Although many people are looking for additive manufacturing to bring manufacturing closer to markets and consumers, the authors believe that this scenario has been exaggerated, largely due to economies of scale. Despite expectations that additive manufacturing will bring a decisive shift from mass manufacturing to mass customization, the likelihood that change will occur quickly is slim, the authors say. What’s more, they raise questions about how flexible additive manufacturing will be. In theory, a good 3-D printer should be capable of printing a wide range of designs. In practice, though, there may be regulations (particularly in safety-critical applications) about how equipment can be configured.","tags":["Hardware","Making","3D Printing"]},{"id":"53863MIT60214","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"How Innovative Partnerships Are Changing Health Care Delivery","authors":["Steven C.

Even years after his death, the full magnitude of its detail had not been fully utilized. Among his 128 Patents are the principle electronic circuits critical to the development of the world's first electronic television system. During his short working life, Blumlein produced patent after patent breaking entirely new ground in electronic and audio engineering.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Alan Blumlein was deeply engaged in the very secret work of radar development and contributed enormously to the system eventually to become 'H2S'- blind bombing radar. Tragically, during an experimental H2S flight in June 1942, the Halifax bomber in which Blumlein and several colleagues were flying, crashed and all aboard were killed. He was just days short of his 39th birthday.\n\nFor many years there have been rumours about a biography of Alan Blumlein, yet none has been forthcoming. This is the world's first study of a man whose achievements should rank among those of the greatest Britain has produced. This book provides detailed knowledge of every one of his patents and the process behind them, while giving an in depth study of the life and times of this quite extraordinary man.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","History"]},{"id":"9780123944245","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Digital Design and Computer Architecture, 2nd Edition","authors":["David Harris","Sarah Harris"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"August 2012","description":"Digital Design and Computer Architecture takes a unique and modern approach to digital design.

This book addresses the close link of microelectronics and artificial intelligence (AI). By combining VLSI technology, a very powerful computer architecture confinement is possible. To overcome problems at different design stages, researchers introduced artificial intelligent (AI) techniques in VLSI design automation. AI techniques, such as knowledge-based and expert systems, first try to define the problem and then choose the best solution from the domain of possible solutions.\n\nThese days, several CAD technologies, such as Synopsys and Mentor Graphics, are specifically created to increase the automation of VLSI design. When a task is completed using the appropriate tool, each stage of the task design produces outcomes that are more productive than typical. However, combining all of these tools into a single package offer has drawbacks. We can’t really use every outlook without sacrificing the efficiency and usefulness of our output. The researchers decided to include AI approaches into VLSI design automation in order to get around these obstacles. AI is one of the fastest growing tools in the world of technology and innovation that helps to make computers more reliable and easy to use. Artificial Intelligence in VLSI design has provided high-end and more feasible solutions to the difficulties faced by the VLSI industry. Physical design, RTL design, STA, etc. are some of the most in-demand courses to enter the VLSI industry. These courses help develop a better understanding of the many tools like Synopsis.

This practical book covers a wide range of antenna array topics that are becoming increasingly important in wireless applications, with emphasis on array design, applications, and computer modeling.\n\nEach chapter in Antenna Arrays builds upon the previous chapter, progressively addressing more difficult material. Beginning with basic electromagnetics/antennas/antenna systems information, the book then deals with the analysis and synthesis of arrays of point sources and their associated array factors. It presents a sampling of different antenna elements that replace these point sources, then presents element configurations that do not have to lie along a line or in a plane.\n\nThe complex and difficult-to-predict interactions of elements and electromagnetic waves are introduced, along with computer modeling and experiments that are necessary for predicting the performance of arrays where mutual coupling is important. Then, various approaches to getting signals to and from the array elements to a computer where the signal detection takes place are explored, as are the numerical techniques behind smart antennas.\n\nThe book emphasizes the computational methods used in the design and analysis of array antennas. Also featured are signal processing and numerical modeling algorithms, as well as pictures of antenna arrays and components provided by industry and government sources, with explanations of how they operate.\n\nFully course-tested, Antenna Arrays serves as a complete text in phased array design and theory for advanced undergraduate- and graduate-level courses in electronics and communications, as well as a reference for practicing engineers and scientists in wireless communications, radar, and remote sensing.","tags":["Hardware","Wireless Technology"]},{"id":"9781631596162","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Block Print Magic","authors":["Emily Louise Howard"],"pages":"144","publication_date":"February 2019","description":"Block Print Magic offers clear how-to instruction for lino block printers of all levels, with a wide selection of work and profiles of five contemporary printers.","tags":["Hardware","Making","3D Printing"]},{"id":"9781118874820","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Wireless Transceiver Architecture","authors":["Pierre Baudin"],"pages":"752","publication_date":"December 2014","description":"A fully comprehensive reference combining digital communications and RFIC (Radio Frequency Integrated Circuits) in one complete volume\n\nThere are many books which focus on the physical implementation of the RF/analog part of transceivers, such as the CMOS design, or the signal processing involved in digital communications.

Hall effect sensors, based on a magnetic phenomena, are one of the most commonly used sensing technologies today. In the 1970s it became possible to build Hall effect sensors on integrated circuits with onboard signal processing circuitry, vastly reducing the cost and enabling widespread practical use. One of the first major applications was in computer keyboards, replacing mechanical contacts. Hundreds of millions of these devices are now manufactured each year for use in a great variety of applications, including automobiles, computers, industrial control systems, cell phones, and many others. The importance of these sensors, however, contrasts with the limited information available. Many recent advances in miniaturization, smart sensor configurations, and networkable sensor technology have led to design changes and a need for reliable information. Most of the technical information on Hall effect sensors is supplied by sensor manufacturers and is slanted toward a particular product line. System design and control engineers need an independent, readable source of practical design information and technical details that is not product- or manufacturer-specific and that shows how Hall effect sensors work, how to interface to them, and how to apply them in a variety of uses. This book covers:• the physics behind Hall effect sensors• Hall effect transducers• transducer interfacing• integrated Hall effect sensors and how to interface to them• sensing techniques using Hall effect sensors• application-specific sensor ICs• relevant development and design toolsThis second edition is expanded and updated to reflect the latest advances in Hall effect devices and applications! Information about various sensor technologies is scarce, scattered and hard to locate. Most of it is either too theoretical for working engineers, or is manufacturer literature that can’t be entirely trusted.

But sometimes the best way to move forward is to look back. Philip Barlag shows us that Julius Caesar is one of the most compelling leaders of the past to study—a man whose approach was surprisingly modern and extraordinarily effective. History is littered with leaders hopelessly out of touch with their people and ruthlessly pursuing their own ambitions or hedonistic whims. But Caesar, who rose from impoverished beginnings, proved by his words and deeds that he never saw himself as being above the average Roman citizen. And he had an amazing ability to generate loyalty, to turn enemies into allies and allies into devoted followers. Barlag uses dramatic and colorful incidents from Caesar's career—being held hostage by pirates, charging headlong alone into enemy lines, pardoning people he knew wanted him dead—to illustrate what Caesar can teach leaders today. Central to Barlag's argument is the distinction between force and power. Caesar avoided using brute force on his followers, understanding that fear never generates genuine loyalty. He exercised a power deeply rooted in his demonstrated personal integrity and his intuitive understanding of people's deepest needs and motivations. His supporters followed him because they wanted to, not because they were compelled to. Over 2,000 years after Caesar's death, this is still the kind of loyalty every leader wants to inspire. Barlag shows how anyone can learn to lead like Caesar.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","History"]},{"id":"9781430224778","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Practical Arduino: Cool Projects for Open Source Hardware","authors":["Hugh Blemings","Jonathan Oxer"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"December 2009","description":"Create your own Arduino-based designs, gain in-depth knowledge of the architecture of Arduino, and learn the user-friendly Arduino language all in the context of practical projects that you can build yourself at home.

These are attractive approaches to tissue engineering because they hold the promise of building bulky tissue constructs with incorporated vasculature. Starting with the discussion of 3D and 4D printing of inanimate objects, the book presents several 3D bioprinting techniques and points out the challenges imposed by living cells on the bioprinting process. It argues that, in order to fine-tune the bioprinter, one needs a quantitative analysis of the conditions experienced by cells during printing. Once the printing is over, the construct evolves according to mechanisms known from developmental biology. These are described in the book along with computer simulations that aim to predict the outcome of 3D bioprinting.In addition, the book provides the latest information on the principles and applications of 4D bioprinting, such as for medical devices and assistive technology. The last chapter discusses the perspectives of the field. This book provides an up-to date description of the theoretical tools developed for the optimization of 3D bioprinting, presents the morphogenetic mechanisms responsible for the post-printing evolution of the bioprinted construct and describing computational methods for simulating this evolution, and discusses the leap from 3D to 4D bioprinting in the light of the latest developments in the field.

It examines the framework and architecture of SS7, as well as how it is used to provide today's telecommunications services. It also examines each level of the SS7 protocol-all the way down to the bit level of messages. In addition, the SIGTRAN standards are discussed in detail, showing the migration from SS7 to IP and explaining how SS7 information is transported over IP.","tags":["Hardware","Wireless Technology","Telecommunications","VoIP"]},{"id":"9781119812449","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Smart Grids and Internet of Things","authors":["Sanjeevikumar Padmanaban","Rajesh Kumar Dhanaraj","Malathy Sathyamoorthy"],"pages":"480","publication_date":"May 2023","description":"SMART GRIDS AND INTERNET OF THINGS\n\nSmart grids and the Internet of Things (IoT) are rapidly changing and complicated subjects that are constantly changing and developing.

This book is written to ensure that you, your family, and your company get your fair share of the trillions of dollars the U.S. government will spend subsidizing individual health insurance plans between now and 2025. You will learn how to navigate the Affordable Care Act to save money without sacrificing coverage, and how to choose the plan that offers exactly what you, your family and your company need.\n\nOver the next 10 years, 100 million Americans will move from employer-provided to individually purchased health insurance. The purpose of The End of Employer-Provided Health Insurance is to show you how to profit from this paradigm shift while helping you, your family, and your employees get better and safer health insurance at lower cost. It will help you save thousands of dollars per person each year and protect you from the greatest threat to your financial future—our nation's broken employer-provided health insurance system.\n\nWe are at the beginning of a paradigm shift in the way businesses offer employee health benefits and the way Americans get health insurance—a shift from an employer-driven defined benefit model to an individual-driven defined contribution model. This parallels a similar shift in employer-provided retirement benefits that took place two to three decades ago from defined benefit to defined contribution retirement plans.\n\nWritten by a world-renowned economist and New York Times best-selling author, this insightful guide explains how individual health insurance offers more to employees than employer-provided plans. Using the techniques outlined in this book, you and your employer will save money on health insurance by migrating from employer-provided health insurance coverage to employer-funded individual plans at a total cost that is 20 percent to 60 percent lower for the same coverage. That's $4,000 to $12,000 in savings per year for a family of four for the same hospitals, same doctors, and same prescriptions.","tags":["Travel & Hobbies","Health & Fitness","Health"]},{"id":"9781783286331","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Haskell Data Analysis cookbook","authors":["Nishant Shukla"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"June 2014","description":"The \"Haskell Data Analysis Cookbook\" offers a comprehensive and practical approach to leveraging the Haskell programming language for advanced data analysis and machine learning tasks.

Just as packaged microprocessor ICs vary widely in their attributes, so do microprocessors packaged as IP cores. However, SOC designers still compare and select processor cores the way they previously compared and selected packaged microprocessor ICs. The big problem with this selection method is that it assumes that the laws of the microprocessor universe have remained unchanged for decades. This assumption is no longer valid.Processor cores for SOC designs can be far more plastic than microprocessor ICs for board-level system designs. Shaping these cores for specific applications produces much better processor efficiency and much lower system clock rates. Together, Tensilica’s Xtensa and Diamond processor cores constitute a family of software-compatible microprocessors covering an extremely wide performance range from simple control processors, to DSPs, to 3-way superscalar processors. Yet all of these processors use the same software-development tools so that programmers familiar with one processor in the family can easily switch to another.This book emphasizes a processor-centric MPSOC (multiple-processor SOC) design style shaped by the realities of the 21st-century and nanometer silicon. It advocates the assignment of tasks to firmware-controlled processors whenever possible to maximize SOC flexibility, cut power dissipation, reduce the size and number of hand-built logic blocks, shrink the associated verification effort, and minimize the overall design risk.· An essential, no-nonsense guide to the design of 21st-century mega-gate SOCs using nanometer silicon.· Discusses today's key issues affecting SOC design, based on author's decades of personal experience in developing large digital systems as a design engineer while working at Hewlett-Packard's Desktop Computer Division and at EDA workstation pioneer Cadnetix, and covering such topics as an award-winning technology journalist and editor-in-chief for EDN magazine and the Microprocessor Report.· Explores conventionally accepted boundaries and perceived limits of processor-based system design and then explodes these artificial constraints through a fresh outlook on and discussion of the special abilities of processor cores designed specifically for SOC design.· Thorough exploration of the evolution of processors and processor cores used for ASIC and SOC design with a look at where the industry has come from, and where it's going.· Easy-to-understand explanations of the capabilities of configurable and extensible processor cores through a detailed examination of Tensilica's configurable, extensible Xtensa processor core and six pre-configured Diamond cores.· The most comprehensive assessment available of the practical aspects of configuring and using multiple processor cores to achieve very difficult and ambitious SOC price, performance, and power design goals.","tags":["Hardware","Chips & Processors"]},{"id":"9781786309044","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Queues Applied to Telecoms","authors":["Toky Basilide Ravaliminoarimalalason","Falimanana Randimbindrainibe"],"pages":"272","publication_date":"January 2023","description":"From queues to telecoms.

Typical sensors, such as Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers, cannot be used under the surface and other inertial systems suffer from a strong integration drift. On top of that, the seabed is generally uniform and unstructured, making it difficult to apply Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) methods to perform localization. Reliable Robot Localization presents an innovative new method which can be characterized as a raw-data SLAM approach. It differs from extant methods by considering time as a standard variable to be estimated, thus raising new opportunities for state estimation, so far underexploited. However, such temporal resolution is not straightforward and requires a set of theoretical tools in order to achieve the main purpose of localization. This book not only presents original contributions to the field of mobile robotics, it also offers new perspectives on constraint programming and set-membership approaches. It provides a reliable contractor programming framework in order to build solvers for dynamical systems. This set of tools is illustrated throughout this book with realistic robotic applications.","tags":["Hardware","Internet of Things (IoT)","Robotics"]},{"id":"01120100041SI","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Korean War: The SIGINT Background","authors":["David A.

As an instructor teaching a master’s-level course on microwave measurements, the author recognized that few of today’s graduate electrical engineering students are knowledgeable about microwave measurements beyond basic distributed circuit analysis. Written in a \"how-it-works\" spirit—strongly borrowing from instrument catalogs and application notes—this text covers a wide range of topics, clarifies many terms used widely on the subject, and equips the reader with the ability to grasp more advanced material.\n\nIt starts with a brief overview of the basic theory and the building blocks required for understanding and using microwave measurement techniques. Oriented around the most commonly used instruments in microwave measurements—the network analyzer, the spectrum analyzer, and synthesized microwave source—it introduces the latest instruments and techniques and provides a brief description of traditional measurement techniques (slotted waveguide etc.).\n\nIt offers an introduction to the mathematical basis behind microwave measurements as well as an overview of some of the practical components that are frequently used in microwave instruments. Observing that students generally grasp the subject better when actual numbers are given, rather than symbolic relations, the author includes examples involving numerical values that are scattered throughout the book. He also provides a detailed description of the vector network analyzer and the spectrum analyzer (explaining its principle of operation and calibration), which form the backbone of modern microwave measurements. In addition, he briefly addresses advanced topics such as pulsed measurements and non-linear network analysis.\n\nComprised of ten chapters, this text:\n\nDiscusses noise measurement and synthesized signal generation\nProvides an overview of RF wafer-probing and modern microwave oscilloscopes—relatively advanced topics\nContains detailed derivations and exercises\n\nAn Introduction to Microwave Measurements\n\nprovides proficiency in subjects related to radio frequency (RF) and microwave systems, and is an ideal resource for senior undergraduate and first-year master’s-level students as well as professionals in the wireless industry who deal with such systems but are not specialists in the area.","tags":["Hardware","Embedded Systems","Microelectronics"]},{"id":"9781492090038","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Predictive Analytics for Healthcare","authors":["Jaquie Finn","Gavin Troughton","Paul Baxter"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"September 2020","description":"Before the onset of COVID-19, the healthcare community was already moving to meet the challenges of a growing global population.

It is one of the most important topics of research in the area of mobile and personal communications. SDR is viewed as the enabler of global roaming and a platform for the introduction of new technologies and services into existing live networks. It therefore gives networks a greater flexibility into mobile communications. It bridges the inter-disciplinary gap in the field as SDR covers two areas of development, namely software development and digital signal processing and the internet. It extends well beyond the simple re-configuration of air interface parameters to cover the whole system from the network to service creation and application development. Reconfigurability entails the pervasive use of software reconfiguration, empowering upgrades or patching of any element of the network and of the services and applications running on it. It cuts across the types of bearer radio systems (Paging to cellular, wireless local area network to microwave, terrestrial to satellite, personal communications to broadcasting) enable the integration of many of today's disparate systems in the same hardware platform. Also it cuts across generation (second to third to fourth). This volume complements the already published volumes 1 and 2 of the Wiley Series in Software Radio. The book discusses the requirements for reconfigurability and then introduces network architectures and functions for reconfigurable terminals. Finally it deals with reconfiguration in the network. The book also provides a comprehensive view on reconfigurability in three very active research projects as CAST, MOBIVAS and TRUST/SCOUT.\n\nKey features include:\n\nPresents new research in wireless communications\n\nSummarises the results of an extensive research program on software defined radios in Europe\n\nProvides a comprehensive view on reconfigurability in three very active research projects as CAST (Configurable radio with Advanced Sodftware Technology), MOBIVAS (Downloadable MOBIle Value Added Services through Software Radio and Switching Integrated Platforms), TRUST (Transparently Re-configurable Ubiquitous Terminal) and SCOUT (Smart User-Centric Communciation Environment).","tags":["Hardware","Wireless Technology","Telecommunications","Radio"]},{"id":"9781449371920","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Data Push Apps with HTML5 SSE","authors":["Darren Cook"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"March 2014","description":"Make sure your website or web application users get content updates right now with minimal latency.

RFID tags can be small adhesive stickers containing antennas that receive and respond to transmissions from RFID transmitters. RFID tags are used to identify and track everything from food, dogs, beer kegs to library books. RFID tags use a standard that has already been hacked by several researchers. RFID Security discusses the motives for someone wanting to hack an RFID system and shows how to protect systems. Coverage includes: security breaches for monetary gain (hacking a shops RFID system would allow a hacker to lower the pricing on any product products). How to protect the supply chain (malicous/mischievous hackers can delete/alter/modify all identifying information for an entire shipment of products). How to protect personal privacy (privacy advocates fear that RFID tags embedded in products, which continue to transmit information after leaving a store, will be used to track consumer habits).The purpose of an RFID system is to enable data to be transmitted by a portable device, called a tag, which is read by an RFID reader and processed according to the needs of a particular application. The data transmitted by the tag may provide identification or location information, or specifics about the product tagged, such as price, colour, date of purchase, etc. .* Deloitte & Touche expects over 10 billion RFID tags to be in circulation by the end of 2005 * Parties debating the security issue of RFID need information on the pros and cons of the technology and this is that information* Little competition in a market desperate for information","tags":["Hardware","Wireless Technology","Radio-frequency identification (RFID)"]},{"id":"9781118452936","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Inkjet Technology for Digital Fabrication","authors":["Ian M.

From the beginning, the concept of cyber-physical systems (CPS), or the sensing and control of physical phenomena through networks of devices that work together to achieve common goals, has been implicit in the IoT enterprise. This book focuses on the increasingly hot topic of Human-in-the-loop Cyber-Physical Systems (HiTLCPS)—CPSs that incorporate human responses in IoT equation.\n\nWhy have we not yet integrated the human component into CPSs? What are the major challenges to achieving HiTLCPS? How can we take advantage of ubiquitous sensing platforms, such as smartphones and personal devices to achieve that goal?

In the experience economy, patients will shift to being empowered consumers who are active participants in their own care. Tailor explores this shift by creating a vision for a newly designed health care system that's focused on both sickness and wellness, and is driven by data and analytics. The new system seamlessly integrates health into our daily lives, and delivers care so uniquely personalized that no two people are provided identical treatments. Connected through data, everyone across the health care ecosystem, including clinicians, insurers, and researchers, will be able to meet individuals wherever they are in their health journey to reach the ultimate goal of keeping people healthy.\n\nThe patient revolution has just begun and an exciting journey awaits us.\n\nPraise for the patient revolution\n\n\"A full 50% of the US population has at least one chronic disease that requires ongoing monitoring and treatment. Our current health care system is woefully inadequate in providing these individuals with the treatment and support they need. This disparity can only be addressed through empowering patients to better care for themselves and giving providers better tools to care for their patients. Both of those solutions will require the development and application of novel technologies. In Krisa Tailor's book The Patient Revolution, a blueprint is articulated for how this could be achieved, culminating in a vision for a learning health system within 10 years.\"\n\n—Ricky Bloomfield, MD, Director, Mobile Technology Strategy; Assistant Professor, Duke Medicine\n\n\"In The Patient Revolution, Krisa Tailor astutely points out that 80% of health is impacted by factors outside of the health care system. Amazon unfortunately knows more about our patients than we do. The prescriptive analytics she describes will allow health care providers to use big data to optimize interventions at the level of the individual patient. The use of analytics will allow providers to improve quality, shape care coordination, and contain costs. Advanced analytics will lead to personalized care and ultimately empowered patients!\"\n\n—Linda Butler, MD, Vice President of Medical Affairs/Chief Medical Officer/Chief Medical Information Officer, Rex Healthcare\n\n\"The Patient Revolution provides a practical roadmap on how the industry can capture value by making health and care more personalized, anticipatory, and intuitive to patient needs.\"\n\n—Ash Damle, CEO, Lumiata\n\n\"Excellent read. For me, health care represents a unique economy—one focused on technology, but requiring a deep understanding of humanity. Ms. Tailor begins the exploration of how we provide care via the concepts of design thinking, asking how we might redesign care with an eye toward changing the experience. She does an excellent job deconstructing this from the patient experience. I look forward to a hopeful follow-up directed at changing the provider culture.\"\n\n—Alan Pitt, MD, Chief Medical Officer, Avizia\n\n\"Whether you're a health care provider looking to gain an understanding of the health care landscape, a health data scientist, or a seasoned business pro, you'll come away with a deeper, nuanced understanding of today's evolving health care system with this book.

They don't understand that for many computer users, a ready-made system is about as satisfying as popping a frozen dinner in the microwave when you'd rather have real food instead. Sure, it works, but it's not exactly what you need or want. There's a lot to be said for a computer that has exactly the quality components you choose, by the manufacturers you choose, rather than the conveniently bundled assortment made for your price point. But perhaps you've stopped short of building your own because you're inexperienced or you're concerned it won't come out right. After all, you want your computer to be perfect. Hesitate no longer: Building the Perfect PC delivers end-to-end instructions (that even inexperienced PC-builders can follow) for creating your ideal machine. Written by hardware experts Robert Bruce Thompson and Barbara Fritchman Thompson, this book covers it all, beginning with the various reasons why you'd want to build your own PC, planning and picking out the components, and putting it all together. The book outlines a variety of complete systems and all of their components, including a small form factor PC; a middle-of-the-road \"sweet spot\" system with top-notch components; and a top-end gaming PC with high-end video, a fast processor, and enough RAM to make your palms sweat just thinking about it. Straightforward language, clear directions, and extensive illustrations make this guide a breeze for computer builders of any level to follow--even those with little or no experience.

The book covers how to use HTML5 in order to serve the needs of people with disabilities and older persons using assistive technology (AT). It aims to be a useful 'go-to' guide, providing practical advice. It takes several approaches, including a look at the new semantics of HTML5 and how to combine its use with authoring practices you know from using earlier versions of HTML. It also demonstrates how HTML5 content is currently supported (or not) by assistive technologies such as screen readers, and what this means practically for accessibility in your web projects.\n\nThe HTML5 specification is huge, with new APIs and patterns that can be difficult to understand. Accessibility can also seem complex and nuanced if you have no experience interacting with people with disabilities. This book walks you though the process of designing exciting user interfaces that can potentially be used by everyone, regardless of ability. Accessibility is really a quality design issue, and getting it right is often more a matter of approach than having sophisticated, cutting-edge tools at your disposal.\n\nThis book will be your companion in your journey to understand both HTML5 and accessibility, as the author has many years of experience as a designer and web developer working directly with people with all types of disabilities.

Rohde"],"pages":"656","publication_date":"August 1997","description":"Over the past decade, great strides have been made in the technology of microwave oscillators and synthesizers, with digital frequency synthesizers in particular attracting much attention. These synthesizers are now being used in virtually all modern signal generators and radio communication equipment. Until now, however, detailed information about their design has been hard to come by-much of it scattered through journal articles-and most books on the subject have taken a primarily theoretical approach. Enter Microwave and Wireless Synthesizers-the first book to emphasize both practical circuit information from RF to millimeter-wave frequencies and up-to-date theory. Based on course material taught by author Ulrich L. Rohde at George Washington University and recent work done by the author at Compact Software, Inc. and Synergy Microwave Corporation, this volume is a complete revision and update of Rohde's landmark text, Digital PLL Frequency Synthesizers: Theory and Design. While it provides all the necessary theory and formulas, it also offers an in-depth look at the practical side of the phase-lock loop (PLL) in synthesizers-including special loops, loop components, and practical circuits-material that is not available in any other book. Rohde explains loop fundamentals, demonstrates the linear approach to oscillator phase noise, discusses the digital direct synthesizer technique, addresses low noise oscillator design, and provides insight into the role and design of crystal oscillators, mixers, phase/frequency discriminators, wideband high-gain amplifiers, programmable dividers, and loop filters. He goes on to cover conventional multiloop synthesizers and survey existing state-of-the-art microwave synthesizer applications. Extensive appendices review the mathematics of useful functions and various applications, including even the complex nonlinear theory of noise in large signal systems such as mixers and oscillators. Microwave and Wireless Synthesizers allows anyone with a PC running either Windows 3.11 or Windows NT to explore real-world design. It uses programs for the solution of digital phase-lock loop systems, tabulates the results, and shows how Bode diagrams are determined by the computer's graphic capabilities. It also includes examples using commercially available linear and nonlinear CAD programs to provide accurate evaluation and optimization of oscillators and other useful circuits and many practical charts. For companies involved in test and communication equipment, this book reduces design and research costs by providing a large number of proven circuits and expediting the design process. It is also an outstanding senior/graduate level textbook for electrical engineering students and an invaluable resource for practicing engineers, senior engineers, and managers who would like to be able to evaluate new trends and techniques in the field.","tags":["Hardware","Embedded Systems","Microelectronics"]},{"id":"9781501505621","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"IoT Security Issues","authors":["Alasdair Gilchrist"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"January 2017","description":"IoT Security Issues looks at the burgeoning growth of devices of all kinds controlled over the Internet of all varieties, where product comes first and security second.

They may even be directly imposed upon religion by external forces. The volume is therefore based on the premise that societal differentiation – and secularity as a specific expression of it – is a widespread structural feature that nonetheless takes on various forms, depending on its historical and cultural context. In order to make this diversity visible, the volume adopts a global comparative perspective, and examines historical distinctions and differentiations in the West and beyond. By examining different forms and modes of secularity in statu nascendi, the volume contributes to developing a better understanding of the diversity of secularities, even of those found in the present day, in terms of their historicity and their specific path dependencies.\n\nWith this shift in perspective, this special volume initiates a global and historical turn in the theory of differentiation, as well as in the study of secularity.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","History"]},{"id":"9780123743978","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Computers as Components, 2nd Edition","authors":["Marilyn Wolf"],"pages":"544","publication_date":"July 2008","description":"Computers as Components, Second Edition, updates the first book to bring essential knowledge on embedded systems technology and techniques under a single cover.

Yet sweeping changes were underway. In l958 Congress awarded the new state over 100 million acres to promote economic development. In 1971, it gave Native groups more than 40 million acres to settle land claims and facilitate the building of an 800-mile oil pipeline. Spurred by the newly militant environmental movement, it also began to consider the preservation of Alaska's magnificent scenery and wildlife. Northern Landscapes is an essential guide to Alaska's recent past and to contemporary local and national debates over the future of public lands and resources. It is the first comprehensive examination of the campaign to preserve wild Alaska through the creation of a vast system of parks and wildlife refuges. Drawing on archival sources and interviews, Daniel Nelson traces disputes over resources alongside the politics of the Alaska statehood movement. He provides in-depth coverage of the growth of Alaskan environmental organizations, their partnerships with national groups, and their participation in political campaigns into the 1970s and after. Engagingly written, Northern Landscapes focuses on efforts to persuade public officials to recognize the value of Alaska's mountains, forests, and wildlife. That activity culminated in the passage of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) of 1980, which set aside more than 100 million acres, doubling the size of the national park and wildlife refuge systems, and tripling the size of the wilderness preservation system. Arguably the single greatest triumph of environmentalism, ANILCA also set the stage for continuing battles over the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and Alaska's national forests.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","History"]},{"id":"9780240820767","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"HTML5, 2nd Edition","authors":["Matthew David"],"pages":"320","publication_date":"April 2013","description":"Implement the powerful multimedia and interactive capabilities offered by HTML5, including style control tools, illustration tools, video, audio, and rich media solutions.

The major forces driving the embedded firmware development process today are reduced development times, increased complexity, and the need to handle multiple tasks simultaneously. These forces translate into strenuous design requirements for embedded engineers and programmers. Many low-level embedded microcontroller designs have insufficient memory and/or architectural limitations that make the use of a real-time operating system impractical.

One of the major performance limitations in today's chip designs is clock skew, the uncertainty in arrival times between a pair of clocks. Increasing clock frequencies are forcing many engineers to rethink their timing budgets and to use skew-tolerant circuit techniques for both domino and static circuits. While senior designers have long developed their own techniques for reducing the sequencing overhead of domino circuits, this knowledge has routinely been protected as trade secret and has rarely been shared. Skew-Tolerant Circuit Design presents a systematic way of achieving the same goal and puts it in the hands of all designers.This book clearly presents skew-tolerant techniques and shows how they address the challenges of clocking, latching, and clock skew. It provides the practicing circuit designer with a clearly detailed tutorial and an insightful summary of the most recent literature on these critical clock skew issues.\n\nSynthesizes the most recent advances in skew-tolerant design in one cohesive tutorial\nProvides incisive instruction and advice punctuated by humorous illustrations\nIncludes exercises to test understanding of key concepts and solutions to selected exercises","tags":["Hardware","Embedded Systems","Microelectronics"]},{"id":"9781509302154","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Programming for the Internet of Things: Using Windows 10 IoT Core and Azure IoT Suite","authors":["Dawid Borycki"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"May 2017","description":"Rapidly implement Internet of Things solutions\n\nCreating programs for the Internet of Things offers you an opportunity to build and program custom devices whose functionality is limited only by your imagination.

It thoroughly examines Lovejoy's contributions to the study of Africa, particularly in exploring issues around production and exchanges at local, regional and international levels. The book offers readers a fresh perspective on the discourse of slavery and colonialism while simultaneously introducing them to the quality of work already accomplished by a stellar scholar.\n\nAs the book argues, Lovejoy presents verifiable historical data that nudges us to reconsider our perception of Africa’s growth trajectory, especially before its encounter with the Americas. A chapter examines the various ways by which the people experienced slavery before it became proliferated during the time Europeans entered into the business. Another chapter addresses questions about the progressive efforts of slave traders to access the interior to drive more victims who would be shipped to the Atlantic for the business of servitude to advance the European economy. Alongside this exploration, a provides the background as to the contributions of Africans to ensure the continuity of this business. Lovejoy notes, for instance, that Muslims were found in every region in the Americas during slavery, which indicates that they were being taken there through transatlantic slavery. While Muslims were found in these areas, it was not true that they were there in large numbers. This is underscored by their resistance to all forms of forced extraction of the people from their homeland. In essence, they challenged the system in ways that redefined their participation in the exercise. The book analyzes how Muslims ensured that economic and political power were withdrawn from the hands of the victims and how they systematically created institutions that promoted that very inequity.\n\nLovejoy’s extensive knowledge allows us to develop theories and establish applicable methodologies for understanding African reality since the precolonial era. He presents original perspectives about addressing issues of African-American engagements and the roles of critical voices in the diaspora. Consequently, the book is an invaluable educational resource, particularly for people who want to deepen their understanding of African social and economic history.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","History"]},{"id":"9781491902899","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Abusing the Internet of Things","authors":["Nitesh Dhanjani"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"August 2015","description":"A future with billions of connected \"things\" includes monumental security concerns.

With its key aims of eradicating the five giant social ills of Want, Ignorance, Disease, Squalor and Idleness, it aimed to providing a minimum standard of living, with all people of working age paying a weekly contribution; in return, benefits would be paid to anyone who was sick, unemployed, retired or widowed. The modern welfare state, therefore, is about maintaining a delicate equilibrium between dependent social groups on the one hand and the active working classes on the other. In the case of old-age security, this balance is being achieved (or not) by the so-called Generation Contract. This social pact is more of an implicit, unwritten and unspecified social contract. This ground-breaking book demonstrates how countries are addressing population-ageing challenges in depth, using the case study of Austria to gain the required complexity and differentiation in a comparative European framework of empirical evidence. This is a broad social science study in political economy and sociology, not an economic analysis. Though focusing on pensions, it centres on the (im)balance between work and non-work, issues of health, work ability, employability, and benefit receipt from old-age security to disability allowance. It will be required reading for all sociologists and social policy experts and academics working within this area.","tags":["Travel & Hobbies","Health & Fitness","Health"]},{"id":"9780123694850","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"High-Performance Embedded Computing","authors":["Wayne Wolf"],"pages":"544","publication_date":"July 2010","description":"Over the past several years, embedded systems have emerged as an integral though unseen part of many consumer, industrial, and military devices.

Provincializing Euro-American queer history, it illustrates how a history of concepts which encompasses the visual offers a greater depth of analysis of the transfer of ideas across regions than texts alone would offer. It also underlines how gay and lesbian history needs to be reframed under a queer lens and understood in a global perspective. Following the journey of the Pink Triangle and its many iterations, A Badge of Injury pinpoints the roles of cultural memory and power in the creation of gay and lesbian transregional narratives of pride or the construction of the historical queer subject.

Whether you're a hobbyist or a professional, it isn't just a breadboard and a hazy idea that keeps you going. It's essential to institute a proper design, device instrumentation and, indeed, test your project thoroughly before committing to a particular prototype.\n\nPractical Arduino Engineering begins by outlining the engineering process, from the basic requirements and preliminary design to prototyping and testing. Each and every chapter exemplifies this process and demonstrates how you can profit from the implementation solid engineering principles—regardless of whether you just play in your basement or you want to publicize and sell your devices.\n\nArduino is a brilliant prototyping platform that allows users to test and iterate design ideas. Imitation by other Arduino makers, hackers and engineers often proves your design's popularity. Practical Arduino Engineering will teach you to follow the engineering process carefully; over time, you will be able to review and improve this process, and even extend its scope.\n\nPractical Arduino Engineering is not purely theoretical. In addition, you'll learn the process of hardware engineering as applicable to Arduino projects, and the importance of the process in each and every project presented in this book.\n\nTo set the stage, Practical Arduino Engineering begins by reviewing the Arduino software landscape, then shows how to set up an Arduino project for testing. Even if you already know your compiler toolchain and the basics of Arduino programming, this refresher course can help fill in the gaps and explain why your compiler may spit out certain error messages.\n\nPractical Arduino Engineering then gradually builds up the engineering process, from single devices like LCDs, potentiometers and GPS modules, to the integration of several modules into larger projects, such as a wireless temperature measurement system, and ultimately an entire robot.\n\nThe engineering projects become progressively more challenging throughout the first 4 engineering chapters. Next, you'll proceed with simple steps towards the first intelligent part of a robot: the object detector. You'll find yourself teaching your robot how to avoid very hot objects or insurmountable obstacles. The basic design requirements for a complete robot and, indeed, the detailed design and prototyping for robots can be extremely tricky, which is why engineering discipline is invaluable.\n\nPractical Arduino Engineering then enters the world of domestic engineering by introducing home alarm systems—not quite as simple as they seem. A solid, robust system can only be built by following the engineering process detailed in previous chapters, and this section reinforces that process.\n\nYou'll then take a step further in your Arduino engineering process: instrumentation and control, and some error messaging using GSM. Control is introduced via the Xbox controller, a very powerful piece of technology able to play a considerable role in robotics projects. Having already learned to control motion and to sense and avoid objects, you'll learn how to debug your Arduino projects of varying complexities via the hardware instrumentation software LabVIEW.\n\nTo complete the journey into Practical Arduino Engineering, you'll discover how to use a special Arduino board to rely on Bluetooth Mate Silver for control of domestic and mobile Arduino projects. Using Bluetooth Mate Silver, you'll learn to implement basic engineering design with almost any Arduino project, and be able to justify, build, debug, and extend Arduino-based designs using a solid engineering approach.","tags":["Hardware","Internet of Things (IoT)","Arduino"]},{"id":"9781680455991","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Make: Technology on Your Time Volume 29","authors":["Mark Frauenfelder"],"pages":"176","publication_date":"January 2012","description":"The first magazine devoted entirely to do-it-yourself technology projects presents its 29th quarterly edition for people who like to tweak, disassemble, recreate, and invent cool new uses for technology.MAKE Volume 29 takes bio-hacking to a new level.

The clash between Palmerston and Metternich stands out. Both men were at the forefront of European foreign relations and were symbols of two different political currents. This work aims to challenge the ‘traditional’ view of Palmerston as a progressive statesman who defended the freedom of European liberalism and Metternich as a reactionary who opposed social modernization.

Building robotics system in the micro scale is an engineering task that has resulted in many important applications, ranging from micromanufacturing techniques to cellular manipulation. However, it is also a very challenging engineering task. One of the reasons is because many engineering ideas and principles that are used in larger scales do not scale well to the micro-scale. For example, locomotion principles in a fluid do not function in the same way, and the use of rotational motors is impractical because of the difficulty of building of the required components.\n\nMicrorobotics is an area that is acknowledged to have massive potential in applications from medicine to manufacturing.

It's about our beginnings as a nation of go-getters who believed they were winners before they won. Using the inspiring story of his own rise from humble beginnings, and that of his parents and grandparents, Bryant shows how individually we can change our mindset from survivor to thriver to winner and move beyond just getting by or being financially independent to becoming wildly successful.

These robots will be intelligent, autonomous, communicative, emotional, and continually progressing in their abilities.\n\nThis book provides an in-depth look at how American consumers will react to the significant social, economic and marketplace changes that will be brought about by the robot revolution. Our insights come from national surveys of over 2,700 Americans, as well as a thorough review of existing academic research and expert predictions. We provide suggestions for publically-acceptable robot roles, robot design and the optimal marketplace approaches for successful human-robot interactions. Ready or not, it’s coming.

With home networking you can move files from one computer to another, share resources, print to a single printer or multiple printers from any computer in the house, and IM the kids when they're holed up in their rooms. And the downside? Anyone who's ever had to troubleshoot a network glitch doesn't need to ask that question. The simple words, \"Why can't I print? Why can't I get to the Internet? Why does my computer say 'Access Denied' today, when it worked fine yesterday?\" are enough to send the home network administrator running for cover. And the concept of \"network security\" can keep the soundest sleeper tossing and turning all night.Currently, more than 8 million homes in the US have installed a network of some kind, and within five years, that number is expected to jump to 37 million. This speaks to the availability of easy-to-install home networking products. Unfortunately, there's also a glut of potential headaches that can occur after installation (and during, sometimes) with no warning label on the box saying, \"This product sure to cause annoyances.\"But help is here. Home Networking Annoyances will ease the headaches and annoyances of anyone who runs a home network. This book tackles all the common annoyances associated with running your network--whether it's wired or wireless, or a combination thereof. Its friendly, off-the-cuff approach will put you in a position of power over those home networking glitches, including file sharing, printing, cabling, security, and much more.

As the sickening results of exposure became evident, many still refused to recognize them. Why? The consequences are still being tallied in the wasted bodies and disrupted lives of thousands who gave their all when the need was greatest, but whose demands for justice have been consumed by years of politics and courtroom maneuvers. Why?, separating reality from myth - and doing so with exceptional literary style and grace. DePalma covered Ground Zero for The New York Times for four years. DePalma introduces heroic firefighters, dedicated doctors and scientists, obsessive city officials, partisan politicians, aggressive lawyers, and compassionate judges and reveals the individual decisions that destroyed public trust, and the desperate attempts made to rebuild it. The dust that was the World Trade Center has changed everything it touched. This is the story of that dust, the 9/11 disaster after the disaster, and what it tells us about ourselves and our future.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","History"]},{"id":"9781430247432","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"HTML5 Game Programming with enchant.js","authors":["Brandon McInnis","Ryo Shimizu","Hidekazu Furukawa"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"May 2013","description":"HTML5 Game Programming with enchant.js gives first-time programmers of all ages the tools to turn their video game ideas into reality.

Also known as “additive manufacturing” or “rapid prototyping,” 3-D printing is the printing of solid, physical 3-D objects. Unlike machining processes, which are subtractive in nature, 3-D printing systems join together raw materials to form an object. Some see 3-D printing and related technologies as having transformative implications. “Just as the Web democratized innovation in bits, a new class of ‘rapid prototyping’ technologies, from 3-D printers to laser cutters, is democratizing innovation in atoms,” Wired magazine’s longtime editor-in-chief, Chris Anderson, stated in his new book Makers: The New Industrial Revolution. “A new digital revolution is coming, this time in fabrication,” MIT professor Neil Gershenfeld wrote in a recent issue of Foreign Affairs. But in addition to 3-D printing’s technological implications, recent evolutions in 3-D printing offer important management lessons for executives about the changing face of technological innovation — and what that means for businesses. In this article, the authors examine the rapid emergence of a movement called open-source 3-D printing and how it fits into a general trend toward open-source innovation by collaborative online communities. They then discuss how existing companies can respond to — and sometimes benefit from — open-source innovation if it occurs in their industry.","tags":["Hardware","Making","3D Printing"]},{"id":"9789814613798","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Integrated Nanophotonic Resonators","authors":["Ya Sha Yi"],"pages":"310","publication_date":"September 2015","description":"The rapid advancement of integrated optoelectronics has been driven considerably by miniaturization.

Web standards are the standard technology specifications enforced by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to make sure that web designers and browser manufacturers are using the same technology syntax. Utilizing web standards helps deliver content to the widest audience possible, while also ensuring future compatibility. These standards also allow content to be more compatible with different viewing devices, such as screen readers, mobile phones and handheld devices. HTML, XHTML, and CSS are all examples of Web Standards technologies.\n\nThis book is your essential guide to understanding the advantages you can bring to your web pages by implementing web standards and knowing precisely how to apply them.\n\nWeb standards such as XHTML and CSS are now fairly well-known technologies, and they will likely be familiar to you, the web designer-indeed, they are all around you on the Web. However, within web standards still lies a challenge-while the browser's support for web stan- dards is steadily increasing, many web developers and designers have yet to discover the real benefits of web standards or to respect the need to adhere to them. The real art is in truly understanding the benefits and implementing the standards efficiently.\n\nWeb Standards Solutions is broken down into 16 short chapters, each covering the theory and practice of different web standards concepts and showing multiple solutions to given problems for easy learning. You'll learn about creating multicolumn layouts, using image replacement techniques to your best advantage, making the best use of tables and lists, and much more.

Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is a technology that can provide more accurate information in near real time and thus increase the quality and timeliness of decisions based on that information. RFID systems are currently in use in areas such as inventory management, process control, asset tracking and monitoring, and retail point of sale. Organizations which appropriately incorporate RFID into their operations and information management systems have increased their agility, effectiveness, and efficiency resulting in organizational growth and increased profitability. The appropriate utilization of RFID allows organizations to become more agile resulting in their ability to respond to customers more efficiently and effectively. Technology by itself does not result in improvements and RFID is no exception. RFID is not a solution for every problem. However, when coupled with other appropriate technologies to address an appropriate objective, RFID can offer a variety of benefits to businesses. The proper integration into the firm's competitive plans and processes, and the ability to leverage those technologies for competitive advantage results in increased performance for organizations. The intent of this book is to provide a sufficient discussion of RFID to enable readers with no prior knowledge to develop a basic understanding of the technology. The book discusses current applications and specific examples of RFID usage taken from a variety of industries. The appropriate coupling of RFID with other technologies such as GPS, ERP, and robotics is discussed as well as an overview of the RFID implementation process.

It includes the design of innovative Robot Process Automation (RPA) concepts, the discussion of related research fields (e.g., Artificial Intelligence, AI), the evaluation of existing software products, and findings from real-life implementation projects.\n\nSimilar to the substitution of physical work in manufacturing (blue collar automation), Robotic Process Automation tries to substitute intellectual work in office and administration processes with software robots (white-collar automation). The starting point for the development of RPA was the observation that – despite the use of process-oriented enterprise systems (such as ERP, CRM and BPM systems) – additional manual activities are still indispensable today. In the RPA approach, these manual activities are learned and automated by software robots, either by defining rules or by observing manual activities.\n\nRPA is related to business process management, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. Tools for RPA originated from dedicated stand-alone software. Today, RPA functionalities are also integrated into elaborated process management suites. From a conceptual perspective, RPA can be structured into input components (sensors in the wide sense), an intelligence center, and output components (actuators in the wide sense). From a strategic perspective, the impact of RPA can be related to the support of existing tasks, the complete substitution of human activities, and the innovation of processes as well as business models.\n\nAt present, high expectations are related to the use of RPA in the improvement of software-supported business processes. Manual activities are learned and automated by software robots that interact with existing applications via the presentation layer. In combination with artificial intelligence (AI) as well as innovative interfaces (e. g., voice recognition) RPA creates a novel level of automation for office and administration processes. Its benefit potential reaches a return on investment (ROI) up-to 800% that is documented in various case studies.","tags":["Hardware","Internet of Things (IoT)","Robotics","Robotic Process Automation"]},{"id":"9780471332329","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Sensors and Signal Conditioning, 2nd Edition","authors":["Ramón Pallás-Areny","John G.

Its sublime imagery makes spirits soar. Its positive portrayal of women such as the Samaritan woman, the Bethany sisters, and Mary Magdalene, tickle the imagination when it comes to the roles of women in the early church. Its disparagement of the Jews, however, reverberates through the long history of anti-Judaism and antisemitism to this very day.\n\nAdele Reinhartz has been one of the foremost interpreters of the Gospel of John for the past thirty years and more. This volume contains a selection of her essays on the Fourth Gospel, originally published from 1991 to 2020. The collection focuses on four major themes. Essays on Gender consider the Gospel’s portrayal of female characters, its christological use of female imagery, and the possibility of reading social history into or out of the Fourth Gospel. Essays on \"the Jews\" explore the representation of the ioudaioi, and respond to approaches employed by scholars to address the fraught question of anti-Judaism. The section on Method includes essays that apply different approaches, such as trauma theory, postcolonial theory, and literary and rhetorical criticism to issues in Johannine studies. The final section, on Ethics, considers ethics from two perspectives: the ethical stance(s) that a reader brings to her reading of John, and the question of whether the Gospel portrays Jesus as an ethical actor.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","History"]},{"id":"9781484290071","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Sensors and Protocols for Industry 4.0: Industrial Applications of Maker Tech","authors":["G.

The essays in this book examine both the vital and violent ways in which recent associations have been made between the AIDS pandemic and African diasporic cultural practices, including religious worship, music, dance, sculpture, painting, orature, literature and film. While pointing to the lengthy and complex history of the metaphor of African contagion, Browning argues that in its politicized, life-affirming embodiment, the figure might actually teach us to respond to epidemia humanely.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","History"]},{"id":"0596009623","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Asterisk: The Future of Telephony","authors":["Jim Van Meggelen","Jared Smith","Leif Madsen"],"pages":"408","publication_date":"September 2005","description":"It may be a while before Internet telephony with VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) reaches critical mass, but there's already tremendous movement in that direction. A lot of organizations are not only attracted to VoIP's promise of cost savings, but its ability to move data, images, and voice traffic over the same connection. Think of it: a single Internet phone call can take information sharing to a whole new level.\n\nThat's why many IT administrators and developers are actively looking to set up VoIP-based private telephone switching systems within the enterprise. The efficiency that network users can reach with it is almost mind-boggling. And cheap, if the system is built with open source software like Asterisk. There are commercial VoIP options out there, but many are expensive systems running old, complicated code on obsolete hardware. Asterisk runs on Linux and can interoperate with almost all standards-based telephony equipment. And you can program it to your liking.\n\nAsterisk's flexibility comes at a price, however: it's not a simple system to learn, and the documentation is lacking. Asterisk: The Future of Telephony solves that problem by offering a complete roadmap for installing, configuring, and integrating Asterisk with existing phone systems. Our guide walks you through a basic dial plan step by step, and gives you enough working knowledge to set up a simple but complete system.\n\nWhat you end up with is largely up to you. Asterisk embraces the concept of standards-compliance, but also gives you freedom to choose how to implement your system. Asterisk: The Future of Telephony outlines all the options, and shows you how to set up voicemail services, call conferencing, interactive voice response, call waiting, caller ID, and more. You'll also learn how Asterisk merges voice and data traffic seamlessly across disparate networks. And you won't need additional hardware. For interconnection with digital and analog telephone equipment, Asterisk supports a number of hardware devices.\n\nReady for the future of telephony? We'll help you hook it up.","tags":["Hardware","Wireless Technology","Telecommunications","VoIP","Asterisk"]},{"id":"9781484233634","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Smarter Homes: How Technology Will Change Your Home Life","authors":["Alexandra Deschamps-Sonsino"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"September 2018","description":"Examine the history of smart homes, how technology shapes our lives, and ways you can think about the home when developing new products.

The drastic increase in available information has compelled individuals to find a way to sift through the media that is literally at their fingertips. Content recommendation systems have emerged as the technological solution to this social and informational problem, but they’ve also created a bigger crisis in confirming our biases by showing us only, and exactly, what it predicts we want to see.\n \nData versus Democracy investigates and explores how, in the era of social media, human cognition, algorithmic recommendation systems, and human psychology are all working together to reinforce (and exaggerate) human bias. The dangerous confluence of these factors is driving media narratives, influencing opinions, and possibly changing election results. \nIn this book, algorithmic recommendations, clickbait, familiarity bias, propaganda, and other pivotal concepts are analyzed and then expanded upon via fascinating and timely case studies: the 2016 US presidential election, Ferguson, GamerGate, international political movements, and more events that come to affect every one of us.\n \nWhat are the implications of how we engage with information in the digital age? Data versus Democracy explores this topic and an abundance of related crucial questions. We live in a culture vastly different from any that has come before. In a society where engagement is currency, we are the product.

The rise in service sector industries has meant an increase in employees being exposed to risks such as musculo-skeletal injury and stress-related illnesses.\n\nAt a time when both public and private sector organisations are becoming ever more aware of the importance of promoting positive public images and enjoying good standing among stakeholders, safety specialists are keen to persuade managers to take a more comprehensive view of how health and safety can contribute to wider business objectives. It is no longer enough just complying with the minimum requirements of the law.","tags":["Travel & Hobbies","Health & Fitness","Health"]},{"id":"9780415919807","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Infectious Rhythm","authors":["Barbara Browning"],"pages":"256","publication_date":"June 2013","description":"Barbara Browning follows the trail of \"infectious rhythm\" from the ecstatic percussion of a Brazilian carnival group to the eerily silent video image of the LAPD beating a man like a drum. Throughout, she identifies the metaphoric strain of contagion which both celebrates the diasporic spread of African culture, and serves as the justification for its brutal repression. The essays in this book examine both the vital and violent ways in which recent associations have been made between the AIDS pandemic and African diasporic cultural practices, including religious worship, music, dance, sculpture, painting, orature, literature and film. While pointing to the lengthy and complex history of the metaphor of African contagion, Browning argues that in its politicized, life-affirming embodiment, the figure might actually teach us to respond to epidemia humanely.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","History"]},{"id":"0596009623","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Asterisk: The Future of Telephony","authors":["Jim Van Meggelen","Jared Smith","Leif Madsen"],"pages":"408","publication_date":"September 2005","description":"It may be a while before Internet telephony with VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) reaches critical mass, but there's already tremendous movement in that direction. A lot of organizations are not only attracted to VoIP's promise of cost savings, but its ability to move data, images, and voice traffic over the same connection. Think of it: a single Internet phone call can take information sharing to a whole new level.\n\nThat's why many IT administrators and developers are actively looking to set up VoIP-based private telephone switching systems within the enterprise. The efficiency that network users can reach with it is almost mind-boggling. And cheap, if the system is built with open source software like Asterisk. There are commercial VoIP options out there, but many are expensive systems running old, complicated code on obsolete hardware. Asterisk runs on Linux and can interoperate with almost all standards-based telephony equipment. And you can program it to your liking.\n\nAsterisk's flexibility comes at a price, however: it's not a simple system to learn, and the documentation is lacking. Asterisk: The Future of Telephony solves that problem by offering a complete roadmap for installing, configuring, and integrating Asterisk with existing phone systems. Our guide walks you through a basic dial plan step by step, and gives you enough working knowledge to set up a simple but complete system.\n\nWhat you end up with is largely up to you. Asterisk embraces the concept of standards-compliance, but also gives you freedom to choose how to implement your system. Asterisk: The Future of Telephony outlines all the options, and shows you how to set up voicemail services, call conferencing, interactive voice response, call waiting, caller ID, and more. You'll also learn how Asterisk merges voice and data traffic seamlessly across disparate networks. And you won't need additional hardware. For interconnection with digital and analog telephone equipment, Asterisk supports a number of hardware devices.\n\nReady for the future of telephony? We'll help you hook it up.","tags":["Hardware","Wireless Technology","Telecommunications","VoIP","Asterisk"]},{"id":"9781484233634","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Smarter Homes: How Technology Will Change Your Home Life","authors":["Alexandra Deschamps-Sonsino"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"September 2018","description":"Examine the history of smart homes, how technology shapes our lives, and ways you can think about the home when developing new products.

When President Gerald Ford ordered these aphorisms distributed to his White House staff in 1974, the collection became known as \"Rumsfeld's Rules.\"\n\nFirst gathered as three-by-five cards in a shoebox and then typed up and circulated informally over the years, these eminently nonpartisan rules have amused and enlightened presidents, business executives, chiefs of staff, foreign officials, diplomats, and members of Congress.  They earned praise from the Wall Street Journal as \"Required reading,\" and from the New York Times which said: \"Rumsfeld's Rules can be profitably read in any organization…The best reading, though, are his sprightly tips on inoculating oneself against that dread White House disease, the inflated ego.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the collection continued to grow as Rumsfeld added new rules derived from things he read, heard, or observed in more than eight decades of a remarkable life. Now these legendary rules are made available for the first time to corporate executive. Rumsfeld has selected his most useful and important rules for effective leadership, enhanced with fresh insights and entertaining anecdotes, and discusses them in the blunt and witty style that made his Pentagon press conferences \"must-see TV.\"\n\nDistilled from a career of unusual breadth and accomplishment, and organized under practical topics like hiring people, running a meeting, and dealing with the press, Rumsfeld's Rules can benefit people at every stage in their careers and in every walk of life, from aspiring politicos and industrialists to recent college graduates, teachers, and business leaders.\n\nThe book provides unprecedented insight into leadership, management, strategy, and life—thinking that not only helped Rumsfeld lead the Pentagon in wartime, but earned him a reputation as one of America's toughest and most effective CEOs.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","History"]},{"id":"9781000325751","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Optoelectronic Organic-Inorganic Semiconductor Heterojunctions","authors":["Ye Zhou"],"pages":"378","publication_date":"January 2021","description":"This book summarizes advances in the development of organic-inorganic semiconductor heterojunctions, points out challenges and possible solutions for material/device design, and evaluates prospects for commercial applications.

Which processor will I use? How should I choose it?' Given the task of selecting an architecture or design approach, both engineers and managers require a knowledge of the whole system and an explanation of the design tradeoffs and their effects. This is information that rarely appears in data sheets or user manuals. This book fills that knowledge gap.Section 1 provides a primer and history of the three basic microprocessor architectures. Section 2 describes the ways in which the architectures react with the system. Section 3 looks at some more commercial aspects such as semiconductor technology, the design cycle, and selection criteria. The appendices provide benchmarking data and binary compatibility standards. Since the first edition of this book was published, much has happened within the industry. The Power PC architecture has appeared and RISC has become a more significant challenger to CISC. The book now includes new material on Power PC, and a complete chapter devoted to understanding the RISC challenge. The examples used in the text have been based on Motorola microprocessor families, but the system considerations are also applicable to other processors. For this reason comparisons to other designs have been included, and an overview of other processors including the Intel 80x86 and Pentium, DEC Alpha, SUN Sparc, and MIPS range has been given. Steve Heath has been involved in the design and development of microprocessor based systems since 1982. These designs have included VMEbus systems, microcontrollers, IBM PCs, Apple Macintoshes, and both CISC and RISC based multiprocessor systems, while using operating systems as varied as MS-DOS, UNIX, Macintosh OS and real time kernels.

This book describes the principles of MEMS via a unified approach and closed-form solutions to micromechanical problems, which have been recently developed by the author and go beyond what is available in other texts. The closed-form solutions allow the reader to easily understand the linear and nonlinear behaviors of MEMS and their design applications.\n\nBeginning with an overview of MEMS, the opening chapter also presents dimensional analysis that provides basic dimensionless parameters existing in large- and small-scale worlds. The book then explains microfabrication, which presents knowledge on the common fabrication process to design realistic MEMS. From there, coverage includes:\n\nStatics/force and moment acting on mechanical structures in static equilibrium\n\nStatic behaviors of structures consisting of mechanical elements\n\nDynamic responses of the mechanical structures by the solving of linear as well as nonlinear governing equations\n\nFluid flow in MEMS and the evaluation of damping force acting on the moving structures\n\nBasic equations of electromagnetics that govern the electrical behavior of MEMS\n\nCombining the MEMS building blocks to form actuators and sensors for a specific purpose\n\nAll chapters from first to last use a unified approach in which equations in previous chapters are used in the derivations of closed-form solutions in later chapters. This helps readers to easily understand the problems to be solved and the derived solutions. In addition, theoretical models for the elements and systems in the later chapters are provided, and solutions for the static and dynamic responses are obtained in closed-forms.\n\nThis book is designed for senior or graduate students in electrical and mechanical engineering, researchers in MEMS, and engineers from industry. It is ideal for radio frequency/electronics/sensor specialists who, for design purposes, would like to forego numerical nonlinear mechanical simulations. The closed-form solution approach will also appeal to device designers interested in performing large-scale parametric analysis.","tags":["Hardware","Embedded Systems","Microelectronics"]},{"id":"9781789342055","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Hands-On Robotics with JavaScript","authors":["Kassandra Perch"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"August 2018","description":"\"Hands-On Robotics with JavaScript\" empowers readers to leverage their JavaScript skills to design and program functional robots using Johnny-Five and Raspberry Pi.

Did Americans truly want to “subvert” the Soviet regime with abstraction, and were the Soviets really “afraid” of non-figurative art? And, most noteworthy, can we adequately assess the role of art as a “weapon” of the Cold War? The significance of Shared Images lies in its revision of what, to date, has been a biased, politicized approach to American art and Soviet cultural policies during the Cold War. Shared Images proposes that we write Cold War art history without merely projecting political events onto the art historical timeline and interpolating the logic of Cold War politics into cultural history. Instead, the monograph presents a careful narrative which, along with major political events, also considers individual agencies, affective regimes, and, of course, formative contexts other than the political. Exploring American art as an essentially global phenomenon, the monograph employs the concept of a “shared history” to analyze interconnections and mutual dependence of Soviet and American art histories from the late 1940s to the 1960s. Shared Images, thus, revises narratives on Soviet and American isolationism, allegedly a distinctive feature of Cold War cultures.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","History"]},{"id":"0321430840","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"HTML, XHTML, & CSS, Sixth Edition: Visual QuickStart Guide","authors":["Elizabeth Castro"],"pages":"456","publication_date":"August 2006","description":"Need to learn HTML fast?

It has become an empire.\"Garrison traces the roots of the American empire to the very beginnings of the republic, in particular to the historic willingness of United States' to use military might in the defense of two consistent --- if sometimes contradictory --- foreign policy objectives: protection of American commercial interests and promotion of democracy.How long can the American empire last? Garrison looks at American history within the context of the rise and fall of empires and argues that the U. S. can gain important insights into durability from the Romans. He details the interplay between military power, political institutions, and legal structures that enabled the Roman empire at it's apogee to last for longer than America has as a country.But the real question is, what kind of empire can and should America be? As the sole superpower, America must lead in shaping a new global order, just as after World War II Roosevelt and Truman took the lead in shaping a new international order. That international order is now crumbling under the pressures of globalization, persistent poverty, terrorism and fundamentalism. Garrison outlines the kinds of cooperative global structures America must promote if its empire is to leave a lasting legacy of greatness. Garrison calls for Americans to consciously see themselves as a transitional empire, one whose task is not to dominate but to catalyze the next generation of global governance mechanisms that would make obsolete the need for empire. If this is done, America could be the final empire.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","History"]},{"id":"9781439863015","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Mobile Intelligent Autonomous Systems","authors":["Jitendra R.

Mit Blick auf die Periode zwischen Knappschaftsgesetz einerseits und Gründung der Reichsknappschaft andererseits (1854-1923) untersucht diese Arbeit ein versicherungsökonomisches Problem, über das bereits die zeitgenössischen Beobachter der Knappschaftsvereine intensiv diskutierten: Wie ist die optimale Größe eines Sozialversicherungsträgers zu bestimmen und zu implementieren? Gibt es überhaupt eine „optimale“ Größe? Oder gilt nicht vielmehr „je größer, desto besser“? Vor dem Hintergrund zweier ökonomischer Kategorien – versicherungstechnisches Risikos und Verwaltungseffizienz – werden diese Fragen am konkreten historischen Beispiel der preußischen Knappschaftsvereine untersucht. Obwohl die jüngere Historiographie die außerordentliche Bedeutung der Knappschaftsvereine des 19. Jahrhunderts als eines der ersten Sozialversicherungssysteme überhaupt herausgestellt hat, stellt deren Wirtschafts- bzw. Versicherungsgeschichte ein Forschungsdesiderat dar. Diese Arbeit füllt zu einem gewissen Grad diese Forschungslücke, indem sie auf ein historisches Phänomen fokussiert, dessen Analyse nicht ohne den direkten Bezug auf grundlegende ökonomische Zusammenhänge auskommt: der zu beobachtende Prozess interner und insbesondere externer Konzentration innerhalb der Knappschaftsvereine, der spätestens mit dem frühen 1870iger Jahren einsetzte und in der Gründung der Reichsknappschaft kulminierte.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","History"]},{"id":"53863MIT60119","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Four Ways Jobs Will Respond to Automation","authors":["Scott Latham","Beth Humberd"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"October 2018","description":"The robots are coming!

Machine-to-machine communications, big data, cloud computing, distributed systems, networking, mobile and telco, apps, and smart devices all contribute to IoT capabilities. This O’Reilly report examines the critical role that operational databases play in that convergence.\n\nIoT data management platforms need to handle data in motion (fast data) as well as data at rest (big data). Legacy data systems aren’t designed to manage vast inflows of high-velocity data from multiple devices and sources. But as VoltDB CTO Ryan Betts explains, operational databases have the performance and scalability to combine data from analytics run against collected (big) data with the current state and readings of things (fast).\n\nThis report explains how operational databases enable IoT applications to fulfill four data management capabilities:\n\nFast Ingest: In-memory performance and horizontal scalability that provide a single ingestion point for high-velocity data feeds\nExplore and Analyze: Real-time access to applications and querying engines\nAct: The ability to trigger events and make decisions based on inbound streams\nExport: The ability to export accumulated, filtered, enriched, or augmented data to downstream systems\n\nAbout the author\n\nRyan Betts, VoltDB CTO, is one of the company’s founding developers.
