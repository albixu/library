Pearson"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"April 2017","description":"It is impossible to block negative emotions from the workplace. Whether provoked by bad decisions, misfortune, or employees’ personal problems, no organization is immune from trouble, and trouble agitates bad feelings. In many organizations, negative emotions are brushed aside or are altogether taboo. However, discounting or brushing aside negative emotions can be costly to organizations — leading to lost productivity and employee disengagement. For more than two decades, the author has studied workplace circumstances that evoke negative emotions, from exceptional organizational crises to everyday incivility. One fundamental finding is that few executives handle employees’ negative feelings well. Many managers report that they do not know how to deal with negative emotions in the workplace. To address this condition, the author details how to improve competence and confidence in responding to negative emotions. She recommends specific actions to prepare for and step up to negative emotions at work — including anger, fear, and sadness, in particular. Promptly stepping up to negative emotions, the author points out, can stem interpersonal turbulence and keep satisfaction, engagement, and productivity intact. What’s more, when negative emotions are acknowledged openly, the author argues, employees can learn to anticipate and interpret their colleagues’ reactions to difficult circumstances more astutely. They grow to understand their own reactions better, too. With these improvements, appropriate responses to challenging situations can be made earlier, when adjustments are generally easier, more effective, and less expensive.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Communication","Emotional Intelligence"]},{"id":"9781098182472","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Serious Cryptography, 2nd Edition","authors":["Jean-Philippe Aumasson"],"pages":"376","publication_date":"October 2024","description":"This practical guide to modern encryption breaks down the fundamental mathematical concepts at the heart of cryptography without shying away from meaty discussions of how they work.

The book focuses on principles and theory which are independent of any one market design. It outlines where the theory is not implemented in practice, perhaps due to other over-riding concerns. The book covers the basic modelling of electricity markets, including the impact of uncertainty (an integral part of generation investment decisions and transmission cost-benefit analysis). It draws out the parallels to the Nordpool market (an important point of reference for Europe). Written from the perspective of the policy-maker, the first part provides the introductory background knowledge required. This includes an understanding of basic economics concepts such as supply and demand, monopoly, market power and marginal cost. The second part of the book asks how a set of generation, load, and transmission resources should be efficiently operated, and the third part focuses on the generation investment decision. Part 4 addresses the question of the management of risk and Part 5 discusses the question of market power. Any power system must be operated at all times in a manner which can accommodate the next potential contingency. This demands responses by generators and loads on a very short timeframe. Part 6 of the book addresses the question of dispatch in the very short run, introducing the distinction between preventive and corrective actions and why preventive actions are sometimes required. The seventh part deals with pricing issues that arise under a regionally-priced market, such as the Australian NEM. This section introduces the notion of regions and interconnectors and how to formulate constraints for the correct pricing outcomes (the issue of \"constraint orientation\").

Using traditional computing, even common desktop encryption could take decades for specialized ‘crackers’ to break and government and infrastructure-grade encryption would take billions of times longer. In light of these facts, it may seem that today’s computer cryptography is a rock-solid way to safeguard everything from online passwords to the backbone of the entire internet. Unfortunately, many current cryptographic methods will soon be obsolete. In 2016, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) predicted that quantum computers will soon be able to break the most popular forms of public key cryptography. The encryption technologies we rely on every day—HTTPS, TLS, WiFi protection, VPNs, cryptocurrencies, PKI, digital certificates, smartcards, and most two-factor authentication—will be virtually useless. . . unless you prepare. \n\nCryptography Apocalypse is a crucial resource for every IT and InfoSec professional for preparing for the coming quantum-computing revolution.

Over 70 percent of degree-granting institutions offer online classes, and while technical resources abound, the courses often fall short of integrating the best practices in online pedagogy, even if they comply with online course design standards. Typically these standards omit the best practices in teaching and learning and the principles from cognitive science, leaving students struggling to keep the pace, understand the material, and fulfill their true potential as learners. This book fills the gap, providing evidence-based practices for online teaching, online course design, and online student motivation integrated with pedagogical and cognitive science to help you build the distance learning courses and programs your students deserve.\n\nAs more and more students opt for distance learning, it's up to designers and instructors to rethink traditional methods and learn to work more effectively within the online learning environment, and up to administrators to provide the needed leadership. Online Teaching at Its Best provides practical, real-world advice grounded in educational science to help online instructors, instructional designers, and administrators deliver an exceptional learning experience.\n\nAdopt new pedagogical techniques designed specifically for online learning environments\nEnsure strong course alignment and effective student learning for online classes\nIncrease student retention, build necessary support structures, and train faculty more effectively\nIntegrate research-based course design and cognitive psychology into graduate or undergraduate programs\n\nDistance is no barrier to a great education; what do stand in the way are inadequate online course design and implementation and deficient faculty training and support—all of which administrators can mitigate. Online Teaching at Its Best will help you ensure that your online classes measure up to the rigor and quality of excellence in teaching and assessment, build in the personal touch for developing a learning community and equip your students to succeed in the next challenge.","tags":["Other","Education"]},{"id":"9780124104884","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"High-Performance Embedded Computing, 2nd Edition","authors":["Marilyn Wolf"],"pages":"506","publication_date":"March 2014","description":"High-Performance Embedded Computing, Second Edition, combines leading-edge research with practical guidance in a variety of embedded computing topics, including real-time systems, computer architecture, and low-power design.

In fact, instructional design is applied learning science. To create effective learning experiences that engage, we need to know how learning works and what facilitates and hinders it. We need to track the underlying research and articulate how our designs reflect what is known. Otherwise, how can we claim to be scrutable in our approaches?\n\nLearning Science for Instructional Designers: From Cognition to Application distills the current scope of learning science into an easy-to-read primer.\n\nGood instructional design makes learning as simple as possible by removing distractions, minimizing the cognitive load, and chunking necessary information into digestible bits. But our aim must go beyond enabling learners to recite facts to empowering them to make better decisions—decisions about what to do, when, and how. This book prepares you to design learning experiences that ensure retention over time and transfer to the appropriate situations.\n\nGain insights into:\n\nProviding spaced practice and reflection\nTapping into motivation and challenge to build learner confidence\nUsing performance-support tools, social learning, and humor appropriately\n\nPrompts at the end of each chapter will spark your thinking about how to use these concepts and more in your daily work.\n\nWritten by Clark N.

Making Sense of People provides the scientific frameworks and tools we need to improve our intuition, and assess people more consciously, systematically, and effectively.\n\nLeading neuroscientist Samuel H. Barondes explains the research behind each standard personality category: extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness. He shows readers how to use these traits and assessments to do a better job of deciding who they'll enjoy spending time with, whom to trust, and whom to keep at a distance. Barondes explains:\n\nWhat neuroscience and psychological research can tell us about how personality types develop and cohere.\n\nThe intertwined roles of genes, nurture, and education in personality development.\n\nHow to recognize troublesome personality patterns such as narcissism, sociopathy, and paranoia.\n\nHow much a child's behavior predicts their adult personality, and how personality stabilizes in young adulthood.\n\nHow to assess integrity, fairness, wisdom, and other traits related to morality.\n\nWhat genetic testing may (or may not) teach us about personality in the future.\n\nGeneral strategies for getting along with people, with specific tactics for special circumstances.\n\nKirkus Reviews\n\nA succinct look at personality psychology.\n\nAs a psychiatrist and neuroscientist at the University of California, Barondes (Molecules and Mental Illness, 2007, etc.) has spent years studying human behavior, and this book reflects his systematic, scientific approach for personality assessment. The average person isn't likely to have time to research a difficult boss or potential love interest, but the author supplements intuition with a useful cornerstone for gauging human behavior: a table of the \"Big Five\" personality traits, among them Extraversion vs. Introversion and Agreeableness vs. Antagonism. To learn how to apply the Big Five, Barondes supplies a link for a professional online personality test, in addition to a basic introduction of troubling personality patterns–e.g., narcissism and compulsiveness. While genetics may play a heavy hand in influencing personality, Barondes writes, it's awareness of a person's background, character and life story that is paramount in unearthing reasons for adult behavior. Readers might like to see the author weave more everyday examples into the text–his exercise in fostering compassion by imagining an adult as a 10-year-old child is a gem–but there is plenty here to ponder.\n\nThose looking for traditional \"self-help\" advice won't find it here, but this book clearly lays the groundwork for deeper human interaction and better life relationships.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Communication","Emotional Intelligence"]},{"id":"9781782175063","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Python Projects for Kids","authors":["Jessica Ingrassellino"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"April 2016","description":"Embark on a journey into Python programming specifically customized for young learners with \"Python Projects for Kids.\" This book introduces programming basics through engaging projects, making it delightful for children to learn coding as a fun and interactive craft.

How does a trainer find the right combination and proportion of these elements? How does a trainer know what’s possible?\n\nTo answer these questions, Brian Washburn offers a simple yet elegant periodic table of learning elements modeled on the original periodic table of chemical properties. Washburn’s elements—which are organized into solids, liquids, gases, radioactive, and interactive categories similar to their chemical cousins—are metaphors for the tools and strategies of the field of learning design; when they’re combined, and under certain conditions, they have the potential to create amazing learning experiences for participants. They are that impactful.\n\nFrom critical gas-like elements like the air we breathe, present in every training room (think instructional design or visual design), to radioactive elements, powerful and dangerous yet commonly used (think PowerPoint), Washburn guides you through the pitfalls and choices you confront in creating engaging learning experiences. A well-designed training program can be world-changing, he argues, and if you believe in your craft as a learning professional, you can do this too. Whether you’re an experienced learning designer or new to the field, this book inspires with new ideas and ways to organize the design of your learning programs.

The semiconductor industry is relying more on resolution enhancement techniques (RETs), since their implementation does not require significant changes in fabrication infrastructure. Computational Lithography is the first book to address the computational optimization of RETs in optical lithography, providing an in-depth discussion of optimal optical proximity correction (OPC), phase shifting mask (PSM), and off-axis illumination (OAI) RET tools that use model-based mathematical optimization approaches.\n\nThe book starts with an introduction to optical lithography systems, electric magnetic field principles, and the fundamentals of optimization from a mathematical point of view. It goes on to describe in detail different types of optimization algorithms to implement RETs. Most of the algorithms developed are based on the application of the OPC, PSM, and OAI approaches and their combinations. Algorithms for coherent illumination as well as partially coherent illumination systems are described, and numerous simulations are offered to illustrate the effectiveness of the algorithms. In addition, mathematical derivations of all optimization frameworks are presented.\n\nThe accompanying MATLAB® software files for all the RET methods described in the book make it easy for readers to run and investigate the codes in order to understand and apply the optimization algorithms, as well as to design a set of optimal lithography masks. The codes may also be used by readers for their research and development activities in their academic or industrial organizations. An accompanying MATLAB® software guide is also included. An accompanying MATLAB® software guide is included, and readers can download the software to use with the guide at ftp://ftp.wiley.com/public/sci_tech_med/computational_lithography.\n\nTailored for both entry-level and experienced readers, Computational Lithography is meant for faculty, graduate students, and researchers, as well as scientists and engineers in industrial organizations whose research or career field is semiconductor IC fabrication, optical lithography, and RETs. Computational lithography draws from the rich theory of inverse problems, optics, optimization, and computational imaging; as such, the book is also directed to researchers and practitioners in these fields.","tags":["Hardware","Embedded Systems","Microelectronics"]},{"id":"9780134486819","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Foundations of Economics, 8th Edition","authors":["Robin Bade","Michael Parkin"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"January 2017","description":"An engaging, practice-oriented approach to understanding core economic principles\n\nFoundations of Economics,8th Edition introduces readers to the economic principles they can use to navigate the financial decisions of their futures.

But we can replace the current picture of global upheaval, unsustainability, and uncertainty with one of an economy that works for all people, and the planet. First, we must eliminate rising income inequality within societies where productivity and wage growth has slowed. Second, we must reduce the dampening effect of monopoly market power wielded by large corporations on innovation and productivity gains. And finally, the short-sighted exploitation of natural resources that is corroding the environment and affecting the lives of many for the worse must end.\n\nThe debate over the causes of the broken economy—laissez-faire government, poorly managed globalization, the rise of technology in favor of the few, or yet another reason—is wide open. Stakeholder Capitalism: A Global Economy that Works for Progress, People and Planet argues convincingly that if we don't start with recognizing the true shape of our problems, our current system will continue to fail us. To help us see our challenges more clearly, Schwab—the Founder and Executive Chairman of the World Economic Forum—looks for the real causes of our system's shortcomings, and for solutions in best practices from around the world in places as diverse as China, Denmark, Ethiopia, Germany, Indonesia, New Zealand, and Singapore. And in doing so, Schwab finds emerging examples of new ways of doing things that provide grounds for hope, including:\n\nIndividual agency: how countries and policies can make a difference against large external forces\nA clearly defined social contract: agreement on shared values and goals allows government, business, and individuals to produce the most optimal outcomes\nPlanning for future generations: short-sighted presentism harms our shared future, and that of those yet to be born\nBetter measures of economic success: move beyond a myopic focus on GDP to more complete, human-scaled measures of societal flourishing\n\nBy accurately describing our real situation, Stakeholder Capitalism is able to pinpoint achievable ways to deal with our problems. Chapter by chapter, Professor Schwab shows us that there are ways for everyone at all levels of society to reshape the broken pieces of the global economy and—country by country, company by company, and citizen by citizen—glue them back together in a way that benefits us all.","tags":["Business","Economics"]},{"id":"9781430259411","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Reasonably Simple Economics: Why the World Works the Way It Does","authors":["Evan Osborne"],"pages":"332","publication_date":"May 2013","description":"The goal of Reasonably Simple Economics is, not surprisingly, simple: to help us think like economists.

Koo dives deep into the failure of traditional economic solutions to address the economic and social problems of post-Great Recession and post-pandemic economies. Starting with the original concepts of balance sheet recessions and global competition for capital, the author explains why the Great Recession lasted for so long and why well-intentioned policies that worked so well in the past are no longer working today.\n\nReaders will discover that advanced economies moved from what the author calls the \"golden era\" to the \"pursued era\" of economic development long ago, but the policy debate in these countries continues to be informed by golden era assumptions that are no longer relevant but are still taught in universities. That mismatch has led to an over-reliance on monetary policy and an under-reliance on fiscal policy that are distorting economies and worsening inequality in a profoundly transformed world.\n\nWith many real-world examples from the author's extensive involvement in the policy debate on economic, banking and trade issues in several countries, including the U.S., the book describes the correct policy mix in the pursued era as distinct from that in the golden era. It also explains the challenges central banks face in fighting inflation after a decade of over-reliance on monetary policy that flooded the world’s economies with unprecedented liquidity.\n\nInstead of simply assuming the existence of \"trend growth rates\", this book tackles the issue of economic growth head-on so as to elucidate the symmetry between the drivers of growth and the drivers of recession. It also argues that the fundamental disconnect between free trade and free capital movements must be addressed in order to maximize the gains from globalization while minimizing its costs. Written in simple language and with a great sense of urgency, Pursued Economy should be of interest to anyone who is concerned about the global economy, financial stability and geopolitics.","tags":["Business","Economics"]},{"id":"9781786301482","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Analog Electronics for Measuring Systems","authors":["Davide Bucci"],"pages":"180","publication_date":"May 2017","description":"Many instrumentation engineers and scientists often deal with analog electronic issues when approaching delicate measurements.

Until some ten years ago, the analysis of transmission lines was a standard topic in the EE and CpE undergraduate curricula. Today most of the undergraduate curricula contain a rather brief study of the analysis of transmission lines in a one-semester junior-level course on electromagnetics. In some schools, this study of transmission lines is relegated to a senior technical elective or has disappeared from the curriculum altogether. This raises a serious problem in the preparation of EE and CpE undergraduates to be competent in the modern industrial world. For the reasons mentioned above, today's undergraduates lack the basic skills to design high-speed digital and high-frequency analog systems. It does little good to write sophisticated software if the hardware is unable to process the instructions. This problem will increase as the speeds and frequencies of these systems continue to increase seemingly without bound. This book is meant to repair that basic deficiency.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Engineering","Electrical Engineering"]},{"id":"9781138027190","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Mechatronics Engineering and Electrical Engineering","authors":["Ai Sheng"],"pages":"396","publication_date":"May 2015","description":"The 2014 International Conference on Mechatronics Engineering and Electrical Engineering (CMEEE2014) was held October 18-19, 2014 in Sanya, Hainan, China.

This book is a welcome addition to a vitally important debate.”—Ian Bremmer, president of Eurasia Group and author of Every Nation for Itself\n\n“Understanding the pluses and minuses of modern ‘capitalism,’ in more than a sloganeering way, is the great challenge for corporations and for government from North America to Europe to East Asia. Strategic Capitalism is a valuable contribution to clear thinking about this imperative.” —James Fallows, The Atlantic, and author of China Airborne\n\n“Professor D’Aveni is a business provocateur extraordinaire. He tells you the straight scoop and will never cave to conventional wisdom unless there is proof that it is right. Strategic Capitalism is another example of D’Aveni’s ability to synthesize a complex topic down to its key elements.” —Bill Achtmeyer, Founder, Chairman, and Managing Partner of The Parthenon Group\n\nThe Capitalist Cold War Has Begun\n\nThe United States and its economic allies are under attack by a force unlike any they have ever faced. China and other emerging nations are competing for markets around the world using their own versions of capitalism—and, thus far, they are winning handily.\n\nIn Strategic Capitalism, one of the world’s leading authorities on global business strategy, Richard D’Aveni, describes how the “economic cold war” began, how it is being played out now, and how the West can change the course of events in its favor.\n\nBrilliantly conceived—and sure to ignite passions on both sides of the political aisle— Strategic Capitalism calls for an end to the economic idealism that dominates the national dialog. It also calls for a cold, hard focus on reality, which is this: government-managed capitalist systems consistently outmaneuver and outperform the traditional laissez-faire capitalism of the West.\n\nWith refreshing levels of thoroughness, knowledge, and detachment, D’Aveni describes the competitive landscape today. These are the facts:\n\nThe world’s best competitors—with China in the lead—have adopted elements of managed capitalism, in which government and businesses work together toward a single aim.\nChina’s objective is clear—to displace the United States as the world’s economic leader by becoming the global rule maker.\nIf the West does not act soon, it stands to lose everything it holds most dear: financial prosperity, economic freedom, geopolitical power, national security, and even democratic values.\n\nThis is disruptive innovation on a global scale. But instead of companies using breakthrough products and brands to gain market share, nations are devising “game-changing” economic systems to seize influence over—and beyond—the global economy.\n\nBleak as the situation may be, D’Aveni contends that the West can reverse the trends currently tilting the global balance of power.\n\nIn order to meet the challenges of the future, America must revisit long-held assumptions about economics and economies, seriously consider radical alternative policies, and embrace the concept of Strategic Capitalism.","tags":["Business","Economics"]},{"id":"9781119824169","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Cultivating Curiosity","authors":["Doreen Gehry Nelson"],"pages":"336","publication_date":"September 2021","description":"Give your students a leg up and improve learning outcomes with this revolutionary, hands-on approach to teaching\n\nIn Cultivating Curiosity: Teaching and Learning Reimagined, distinguished educator and author Doreen Gehry Nelson inspires anyone yearning to break away from formulaic teaching.

More. Future.\n\nArtificial intelligence, big data, modern science, and the internet are all revealing a fundamental truth: The world is vastly more complex and unpredictable than we've allowed ourselves to see.\n\nNow that technology is enabling us to take advantage of all the chaos it's revealing, our understanding of how things happen is changing--and with it our deepest strategies for predicting, preparing for, and managing our world. This affects everything, from how we approach our everyday lives to how we make moral decisions and how we run our businesses.\n\nTake machine learning, which makes better predictions about weather, medical diagnoses, and product performance than we do--but often does so at the expense of our understanding of how it arrived at those predictions. While this can be dangerous, accepting it is also liberating, for it enables us to harness the complexity of an immense amount of data around us. We are also turning to strategies that avoid anticipating the future altogether, such as A/B testing, Minimum Viable Products, open platforms, and user-modifiable video games. We even take for granted that a simple hashtag can organize unplanned, leaderless movements such as #MeToo.\n\nThrough stories from history, business, and technology, philosopher and technologist David Weinberger finds the unifying truths lying below the surface of the tools we take for granted--and a future in which our best strategy often requires holding back from anticipating and instead creating as many possibilities as we can. The book’s imperative for business and beyond is simple: Make. More.

For decades OTP has helped developers create incredibly robust, scalable applications with unparalleled uptime. Make the most of them as you build a stateful web app with Elixir, OTP, and Phoenix. Model domain entities without an ORM or a database. Manage server state and keep your code clean with OTP Behaviours. Layer on a Phoenix web interface without coupling it to the business logic. Open doors to powerful new techniques that will get you thinking about web development in fundamentally new ways.\n\nElixir and OTP provide exceptional tools to build rock-solid back-end applications that scale. In this book, you'll build a web application in a radically different way, with a back end that holds application state. You'll use persistent Phoenix Channel connections instead of HTTP's request-response, and create the full application in distinct, decoupled layers.\n\nIn Part 1, start by building the business logic as a separate application, without Phoenix. Model the application domain with Elixir functions and simple data structures. By keeping state in memory instead of a database, you can reduce latency and simplify your code. In Part 2, add in the GenServer Behaviour to make managing in-memory state a breeze. Create a supervision tree to boost fault tolerance while separating error handling from business logic.\n\nPhoenix is a modern web framework you can layer on top of business logic while keeping the two completely decoupled. In Part 3, you'll do exactly that as you build a web interface with Phoenix. Bring in the application from Part 2 as a dependency to a new Phoenix project. Then use ultra-scalable Phoenix Channels to establish persistent connections between the stateful server and a stateful front-end client.\n\nYou're going to love this way of building web apps!\n\nWhat You Need:\n\nYou'll need a computer that can run Elixir version 1.5 or higher and Phoenix 1.3 or higher.

In this masterfully conceived and executed work, Michael Lewitt, one of Wall Street's most respected market strategists and money managers, updates his groundbreaking examination of the causes of the 2008 crisis and argues that economic and geopolitical conditions are even more unstable today. His analysis arrives in time for the impending economic and geopolitical debates of the 2016 election season. Lewitt explains in detail how debt has now overrun the world's capacity, how federal policies of the past few decades have created a downward vortex sapping growth and vitality from the American economy, and how greed and corruption are preventing reform.\n\nThe financial crisis created tens of trillions of debt, leaving investors to pay a huge price for these policy failures:\n\nThe highest asset inflation we've seen in our lifetimes, although the government claims there isn't enough inflation\nMore than $2 trillion of stock buybacks funded with low cost debt that are artificially inflating stock prices\nThe Federal Reserve and other global central banks becoming the largest buyers of government debt in order to suppress interest rates\nAn M&A boom resulting from companies needing to find growth outside of their core businesses\n\nWhile the financial media misses the story, Lewitt pulls no punches explaining how all of these trends are leading to the brink of another crisis.\n\nLewitt lays out a survival plan for the average investor to protect their assets when the debt bubble bursts. The first edition of this book expressed hope that policymakers would not let the financial crisis go to waste.

Contrary to conventional wisdom, the biggest culprits are not video games, pop culture, or female-dominated schools biased toward girls. The real problem is that boys have been thrust into a bewildering new school environment that demands high-level reading and writing skills long before they are capable of handling them. Lacking the ability to compete, boys fall farther and farther behind. Eventually, the problem gets pushed into college, where close to 60% of the graduates are women. In a time when even cops, construction foremen, and machine operators need post-high school degrees, that’s a problem. Why Boys Fail takes a hard look at how this ominous reality came to be, how it has worsened in recent years, and why attempts to resolve it often devolve into finger-pointing and polarizing politics. But the book also shares some good news. Amidst the alarming proof of failure among boys—around the world—there are also inspiring case studies of schools where something is going right. Each has come up with realistic ways to make sure that every student—male and female—has the tools to succeed in school and later in life.

With honest dialogue these kinds of conflicts can usually be resolved. But other peer conflicts are more troublesome because they involve personal values, office politics and power, and emotional reactions. To resolve these more difficult peer conflicts, managers should examine three key issues that can cause such clashes and also influence their outcome. One, they should assess their emotional \"hot buttons\" that trigger ineffective behaviors and make conflict difficult to manage. Two, they should examine their personal values and how those might conflict with what their peers find important. Finally, they should assess their power in the organization - which can be related to position, influence, expertise, or some other factor - and learn how to use it to manage conflicts. Navigating these issues won't rid an organization of conflict among peers.

You know you need concurrent applications, but also know these are almost impossible to get right. Meet Elixir, a functional, concurrent language built on the rock-solid Erlang VM. Elixir's pragmatic syntax and built-in support for metaprogramming will make you productive and keep you interested for the long haul. This book is the introduction to Elixir for experienced programmers. Maybe you need something that's closer to Ruby, but with a battle-proven environment that's unrivaled for massive scalability, concurrency, distribution, and fault tolerance. Maybe the time is right for the Next Big Thing. Maybe it's Elixir. And don't forget to download this handy \"cheat sheet\":https://media.pragprog.com/titles/​elixir/ElixirCheat.pdf for Elixir syntax. As a developer, you've probably heard that functional programming techniques help manage the complexities of today's real-world, concurrent systems. You're also investigating designs that help you maximize uptime and manage security. This book is your guide to Elixir, a modern, functional, and concurrent programming language. Because Elixir runs on the Erlang VM, and uses the underlying Erlang/OTP architecture, it benefits from almost 20 years of research into high performance, highly parallel, and seriously robust applications. Elixir brings a lot that's new: a modern, Ruby-like, extendable syntax, compile and runtime evaluation, a hygienic macro system, and more. But, just as importantly, Elixir brings a sense of enjoyment to parallel, functional programming. Your applications become fun to work with, and the language encourages you to experiment. Part 1 covers the basics of writing sequential Elixir programs. We'll look at the language, the tools, and the conventions. Part 2 uses these skills to start writing concurrent code--applications that use all the cores on your machine, or all the machines on your network! And we do it both with and without OTP. And Part 3 looks at the more advanced features of the language, from DSLs and code generation to extending the syntax. By the end of this book, you'll understand Elixir, and know how to apply it to solve your complex, modern problems.","tags":["Software Development","Programming Languages","Elixir"]},{"id":"9781119707707","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Power Economics","authors":["Elena Cahill"],"pages":"240","publication_date":"March 2021","description":"Energy efficiency is more of a journey than a battle.

If, after the application of any form of smoothing or filtering, the memory of the corresponding data changes heavily, then the final data may lose some important information. This may lead to wrong or erroneous conclusions.

Furthermore, such texts leave it up to the reader to apply their lessons so as to gain value from the knowledge, and to reinforce that knowledge through practice. The \"theory of the firm\" does not resonate with most corporate executives. But in fact, economic forces drive the context for all our important business decisions: When and how much to expand or contract; which markets to enter and exit; when to raise or lower prices; and how to invest surplus resources (retained earnings for companies and savings for individuals). This book is an application of economics (both micro and macroeconomics) to one of the central challenges of our age for any citizen in a developed economy: How to invest their resources in a changed economic landscape. It contends that the quarter century from the early 1980s to the late 2000s was a unique historical period, creating an exceptionally benign commercial and investing environment. It will not return once the Great Recession is firmly behind us. The core message of the book is an extended application of economic principles and reasoning, phrased in a form readily digestible to any interested layman. It can be used as a companion to a traditional economics text, or as a stand-alone application-oriented text. The main application explored is of investment decisions of corporations seeking to deploy retained earnings, and of individuals seeking to prepare for the day when they no longer rely on wage income.","tags":["Business","Economics"]},{"id":"9780124115972","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Academic Press Library in Signal Processing","authors":["Sergios Theodoridis","Rama Chellappa"],"pages":"1012","publication_date":"August 2013","description":"This third volume of a five volume set, edited and authored by world leading experts, gives a review of the principles, methods and techniques of important and emerging research topics and technologies in array and statistical signal processing.\n\nWith this reference source you will:\n\nQuickly grasp a new area of research \nUnderstand the underlying principles of a topic and its application\nAscertain how a topic relates to other areas and learn of the research issues yet to be resolved\nQuick tutorial reviews of important and emerging topics of research in array and statistical signal processing\nPresents core principles and shows their application\nReference content on core principles, technologies, algorithms and applications\nComprehensive references to journal articles and other literature on which to build further, more specific and detailed knowledge\nEdited by leading people in the field who, through their reputation, have been able to commission experts to write on a particular topic","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Engineering","Electrical Engineering","Signal Processing"]},{"id":"9780203495414","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Ethical Hack","authors":["James S.

OO gave developers the ability to create software that was more flexible and robust, but as time went on and applications became more sophisticated, too, certain areas of \"traditional\" OO architectures were found wanting. Aspect-oriented programming (AOP) addresses those issues by extending the OO approach even further.Many developers are interested in AOP--especially in AspectJ, the open source extension of the Java programming language that explicitly supports the AOP approach. Yet, although AspectJ is included with Eclipse, the increasingly popular open source IDE for Java, finding a practical and non-theoretical way to learn this language and other AOP tools and techniques has been a real problem.Until now. The AspectJ Cookbook offers a hands-on solution--in fact, several--with a wide variety of code recipes for solving day-to-day design and coding problems using AOP's unique approach.AOP allows the global properties of a program to determine how it's compiled into an executable program. Before AOP, important program design decisions were difficult to capture in actual code. Instead, the implementation of those design decisions--known as \"aspects\"--were scattered throughout, resulting in \"tangled\" code that was hard to develop and maintain. AOP has been compared to the manufacturing of cloth, in which threads are automatically interwoven. Without AOP, programmers must stitch the threads by hand.The AspectJ Cookbook shows readers why, and how, common Java development problems can be solved by using AOP techniques. With our popular problem-solution-discussion format, the book presents real world examples to demonstrate that AOP is more than just a concept; it's a development process that will benefit users in an immediate and visible manner.If you're interested in how AOP is changing the way software is developed, and how you can use AspectJ to make code more modular, easier to develop, maintain, evolve and deploy, this is the book that really delivers.","tags":["Software Development","Text Editors & IDEs","Eclipse IDE"]},{"id":"0321334612","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Eclipse Rich Client Platform: Designing, Coding, and Packaging Java™ Applications","authors":["Jeff McAffer","Jean-Michel Lemieux"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"October 2005","description":"Build Powerful, Cross-Platform Rich Client Applications\n\nEclipse is more than a state-of-the-art IDE: its Rich Client Platform (RCP) plug-ins form an outstanding foundation for any desktop application, from chat applications to enterprise software front-ends.

Everyone sees the results of their choices, and the consequences for failure are severe. And yet... they keep making the same mistakes over and over again... systematic mistakes you'd think they'd learn how to avoid.

As a result more and more designers have turned to VHDL to help them dramatically improve productivity as well as the quality of their designs.\n\nVHDL, the IEEE standard hardware description language for describing digital electronic systems, allows engineers to describe the structure and specify the function of a digital system as well as simulate and test it before manufacturing. In addition, designers use VHDL to synthesize a more detailed structure of the design, freeing them to concentrate on more strategic design decisions and reduce time to market. Adopted by designers around the world, the VHDL family of standards have recently been revised to address a range of issues, including portability across synthesis tools.\n\nThis best-selling comprehensive tutorial for the language and authoritative reference on its use in hardware design at all levels--from system to gates--has been revised to reflect the new IEEE standard, VHDL-2001. Peter Ashenden, a member of the IEEE VHDL standards committee, presents the entire description language and builds a modeling methodology based on successful software engineering techniques. Reviewers on Amazon.com have consistently rated the first edition with five stars. This second edition updates the first, retaining the authors unique ability to teach this complex subject to a broad audience of students and practicing professionals.* Details how the new standard allows for increased portability across tools.* Covers related standards, including the Numeric Synthesis Package and the Synthesis Operability Package, demonstrating how they can be used for digital systems design.* Presents four extensive case studies to demonstrate and combine features of the language taught across multiple chapters.* Requires only a minimal background in programming, making it an excellent tutorial for anyone in computer architecture, digital systems engineering, or CAD.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Engineering","Electrical Engineering","VHDL"]},{"id":"9780273762539","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Who Cares Wins PDF eBook","authors":["David Jones"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"June 2012","description":"Written by the CEO of Havas Worldwide, this book shows you how to use social media to engage with customers and grow your business.

This important book: \nProvides an understanding of the chemistry of a battery technology\nExplores battery technology's potential as well as the obstacles that hamper the potential from being realized\nHighlights new applications and points out the potential growth areas that can serve as inspirations for future research\nIncludes an understanding of the chemistry of battery materials and how they store and convert energy\nWritten for students and academics in the fields of energy materials, electrochemistry, solid state chemistry, inorganic materials chemistry and materials science, Inorganic Battery Materials focuses on the inorganic chemistry of battery materials associated with both current and future battery technologies to provide a unique reference in the field.\n \nAbout EIBC Books\nThe Encyclopedia of Inorganic and Bioinorganic Chemistry (EIBC) was created as an online reference in 2012 by merging the Encyclopedia of Inorganic Chemistry and the Handbook of Metalloproteins. The resulting combination proves to be the defining reference work in the field of inorganic and bioinorganic chemistry, and a lot of chemistry libraries around the world have access to the online version. Many readers, however, prefer to have more concise thematic volumes in print, targeted to their specific area of interest. This feedback from EIBC readers has encouraged the Editors to plan a series of EIBC Books [formerly called EIC Books], focusing on topics of current interest.\nEIBC Books will appear on a regular basis, will be edited by the EIBC Editors and specialist Guest Editors, and will feature articles from leading scholars in their fields. EIBC Books aim to provide both the starting research student and the confirmed research worker with a critical distillation of the leading concepts in inorganic and bioinorganic chemistry, and provide a structured entry into the fields covered.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Engineering","Electrical Engineering","Batteries"]},{"id":"9780071664516","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Programming and Customizing the Multicore Propeller Microcontroller: The Official Guide","authors":["Parallax"],"pages":"496","publication_date":"February 2010","description":"The Only Official Guide to the Parallax Multicore Propeller Microcontroller\n\nWritten by a team of Propeller experts, this authoritative guide shows you how to realize your design concepts by taking full advantage of the multicore Propeller microcontroller's unique architecture.

And a large part of that detail lies in the practical domain, largely because of the typically small number of microseconds of switching periods involved, and the even smaller tens of nanoseconds of switch transition times --- all these, in effect accentuating various \"second-order\" effects, that eventually end up playing prime havoc with \"normal\" expectations of how the circuit should behave. So not unsurprisingly, even after reading several books, most readers still find themselves no closer to the ultimate goal of designing an actual power supply. Sooner or later, all engineers start realizing the hard fact that designing a switching power supply isn't the trivial task it once seemed to be. But even after years of successfully mastering the underlying theory, the ultimate goal of creating a cost-effective, reliable and commercially viable power supply may still remain a distant dream, since success ultimately hinges on experience. That is, in fact, what clearly differentiates a senior and seasoned power supply engineer from the others --- the ability to navigate and surmount a veritable minefield of tricky issues that can only be learned the hard way, by actual hands-on experience on the job. This book presents practical knowledge the author acquired rather painfully, while working \"in the trenches\" for several years in major engineering companies scattered across several continents. This is intended to be the mythical senior engineer's \"bag of tricks,\" finally made available in the form of an easy-to-read book on your shelf. This book will make life for the ambitious power supply engineer much simpler --- besides reducing significantly, the rigorous requirement of having to be a senior engineer's protégé for years on end, just to gain a small measure of real success in this field.* A practical presentation that answers the important question: why is my switching converter behaving so differently than what I was expecting on the basis of my paper design? And how do I bridge that huge gap?* For the first time, a systematic and thorough discussion of troubleshooting switching power supplies.* Coverage of AC/DC and DC/DC power supplies. * Bench Evaluation of semiconductor ICs used in power conversion --- describing standard and unusual techniques mastered by the author, while testing similar chips at National Semiconductor. * Detailed coverage of vital topics that haven't been covered by available sources --- grounding systems, the subtleties of component datasheets, and using instruments and probes effectively.* Systematic investigation (type of failure mechanism, topology, etc.) and solutions for 5 years of reported power supply issues on a prominent, public web forum. This approach will ensure that engineers will not repeat the same mistakes. * A unique, readable style: personal and direct; no mystification--- just the plain truth, easily and logically explained, with plenty of pictures, graphs and plots.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Engineering","Electrical Engineering"]},{"id":"9780857095268","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Silicon-On-Insulator (SOI) Technology","authors":["O.

The basic skills in the book are new and weren't studied in most curricula some ten years ago. The rapidly changing digital technology has created this demand for a discussion of new analysis skills particularly for the analysis of transmission lines where the conductors that interconnect the electronic modules have become \"electrically large,\" longer than a tenth of a wavelength, which are increasingly becoming important. Crosstalk between the lines is also rapidly becoming a significant problem in getting modern electronic systems to work satisfactorily. Hence this text concentrates on the modeling of \"electrically large\" connection conductors where previously-used Kirchhoff's voltage and current laws and lumped-circuit modeling have become obsolete because of the increasing speeds of modern digital systems. This has caused an increased emphasis on Signal Integrity.\n\nUntil as recently as some ten years ago, digital system clock speeds and data rates were in the hundreds of megahertz (MHz) range. Prior to that time, the \"lands\" on printed circuit boards (PCBs) that interconnect the electronic modules had little or no impact on the proper functioning of those electronic circuits.

The real crisis facing the world is explosive government debt and deficits. Governments are now left with no choice but to spend more than they make, borrow more than they can ever repay, and devalue their currencies to cover it all up.\n\nFormer Hollywood storyteller Adam Baratta brings monetary policy to life in this follow-up to his national bestseller, Gold Is A Better Way. You’ll learn how and why Federal Reserve polices have facilitated an explosion in government debt and have systematically undermined the world financial system in the name of profit. The result? An out of control system where financial inequality has become a ticking time bomb set to blow up the global economy.","tags":["Business","Economics"]},{"id":"9780750680288","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Interfacing PIC Microcontrollers","authors":["Martin P.

This book takes an integrative approach to that topic, showing how short-run and long-run forces operate simultaneously to determine the behavior of key economic indicators such as employment and real, inflation-adjusted GDP. The first goal of macroeconomic policy is to bring real GDP into line with the maximum attainable potential real GDP—the level of real GDP at which there are enough jobs to provide employment for every person who wants to work and at which government has done all it can to eliminate disincentives for workers to seek jobs and for employers to offer them. The second goal is to promote economic growth, which means encouraging innovation and a business climate conducive to innovation. This book corrects a popular view that a protracted economic downturn is necessarily characterized by an excess supply of labor and goods and a need for expansive monetary and fiscal policies. In fact, and as was shown some 40 years ago, the problem could just as well be characterized by an excess demand for labor and goods and a need for contractive monetary and fiscal policy.","tags":["Business","Economics"]},{"id":"9781786303431","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Decision-Making in Crisis Situations","authors":["Sophie Sauvagnargues"],"pages":"218","publication_date":"December 2018","description":"This book presents concepts and methods for optimal training for decision making in crisis situations.

The application of said techniques facilitates message confidentiality and sender/receiver identity authentication, and helps to ensure the integrity and security of computer passwords, ATM card information, digital signatures, DVD and HDDVD content, and electronic commerce. Cryptography is also central to digital rights management (DRM), a group of techniques for technologically controlling the use of copyrighted material that is being widely implemented and deployed at the behest of corporations that own and create revenue from the hundreds of thousands of mini-transactions that take place daily on programs like iTunes.\n\nThis new edition of our best-selling book on cryptography and information hiding delineates a number of different methods to hide information in all types of digital media files. These methods include encryption, compression, data embedding and watermarking, data mimicry, and scrambling. During the last 5 years, the continued advancement and exponential increase of computer processing power have enhanced the efficacy and scope of electronic espionage and content appropriation. Therefore, this edition has amended and expanded outdated sections in accordance with new dangers, and includes 5 completely new chapters that introduce newer more sophisticated and refined cryptographic algorithms and techniques (such as fingerprinting, synchronization, and quantization) capable of withstanding the evolved forms of attack.\n\nEach chapter is divided into sections, first providing an introduction and high-level summary for those who wish to understand the concepts without wading through technical explanations, and then presenting concrete examples and greater detail for those who want to write their own programs. This combination of practicality and theory allows programmers and system designers to not only implement tried and true encryption procedures, but also consider probable future developments in their designs, thus fulfilling the need for preemptive caution that is becoming ever more explicit as the transference of digital media escalates.\n\nIncludes 5 completely new chapters that delineate the most current and sophisticated cryptographic algorithms, allowing readers to protect their information against even the most evolved electronic attacks\nConceptual tutelage in conjunction with detailed mathematical directives allows the reader to not only understand encryption procedures, but also to write programs which anticipate future security developments in their design","tags":["Security","Security Engineering","Encryption / Cryptography"]},{"id":"9781118620632","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Rotating Electrical Machines","authors":["René Le Doeuff","Mohamed El Hadi Zaïm"],"pages":"288","publication_date":"July 2010","description":"In this book a general matrix-based approach to modeling electrical machines is promulgated.

Rohde"],"pages":"656","publication_date":"August 1997","description":"Over the past decade, great strides have been made in the technology of microwave oscillators and synthesizers, with digital frequency synthesizers in particular attracting much attention. These synthesizers are now being used in virtually all modern signal generators and radio communication equipment. Until now, however, detailed information about their design has been hard to come by-much of it scattered through journal articles-and most books on the subject have taken a primarily theoretical approach. Enter Microwave and Wireless Synthesizers-the first book to emphasize both practical circuit information from RF to millimeter-wave frequencies and up-to-date theory. Based on course material taught by author Ulrich L. Rohde at George Washington University and recent work done by the author at Compact Software, Inc. and Synergy Microwave Corporation, this volume is a complete revision and update of Rohde's landmark text, Digital PLL Frequency Synthesizers: Theory and Design. While it provides all the necessary theory and formulas, it also offers an in-depth look at the practical side of the phase-lock loop (PLL) in synthesizers-including special loops, loop components, and practical circuits-material that is not available in any other book. Rohde explains loop fundamentals, demonstrates the linear approach to oscillator phase noise, discusses the digital direct synthesizer technique, addresses low noise oscillator design, and provides insight into the role and design of crystal oscillators, mixers, phase/frequency discriminators, wideband high-gain amplifiers, programmable dividers, and loop filters. He goes on to cover conventional multiloop synthesizers and survey existing state-of-the-art microwave synthesizer applications. Extensive appendices review the mathematics of useful functions and various applications, including even the complex nonlinear theory of noise in large signal systems such as mixers and oscillators. Microwave and Wireless Synthesizers allows anyone with a PC running either Windows 3.11 or Windows NT to explore real-world design. It uses programs for the solution of digital phase-lock loop systems, tabulates the results, and shows how Bode diagrams are determined by the computer's graphic capabilities. It also includes examples using commercially available linear and nonlinear CAD programs to provide accurate evaluation and optimization of oscillators and other useful circuits and many practical charts. For companies involved in test and communication equipment, this book reduces design and research costs by providing a large number of proven circuits and expediting the design process. It is also an outstanding senior/graduate level textbook for electrical engineering students and an invaluable resource for practicing engineers, senior engineers, and managers who would like to be able to evaluate new trends and techniques in the field.","tags":["Hardware","Embedded Systems","Microelectronics"]},{"id":"9781118748756","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"eBay For Dummies, 8th Edition","authors":["Marsha Collier"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"January 2014","description":"The leading guide for eBay buyers and sellers, updated to give you all the essentials for buying and selling on eBay\n\nMore than 112 million people regularly use eBay.

But today, most corporations are obsessed with maximizing their stock prices, resulting in short-term thinking and the kind of cook-the-books corruption seen in the Enron and WorldCom scandals. How did this happen?In this groundbreaking book, Lawrence E. Mitchell traces the origins of the problem to the first decade of the 20th century, when industrialists and bankers began merging existing companies into huge “combines”—today's giant corporations—so they could profit by manufacturing and selling stock in these new entities. He describes and analyzes the legal changes that made this possible, the federal regulatory efforts that missed the significance of this transforming development, and the changes in American society and culture that led more and more Americans to enter the market, turning from relatively safe bonds to riskier common stock in the hopes of becoming rich. Financiers and the corporations they controlled encouraged this trend, but as stock ownership expanded and businesses were increasingly forced to cater to stockholders' “get rich quick” expectations, a subtle but revolutionary shift in the nature of the American economy occurred: finance no longer served industry; instead, industry began to serve finance.The Speculation Economy analyzes the history behind the opening of this economic Pandora's box, the root cause of so many modern acts of corporate malfeasance.","tags":["Business","Economics"]},{"id":"9781953349255","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Macroeconomics, Third Edition, 3rd Edition","authors":["Professor David G.

Formal work is both a facilitator of such processes and is often supported by them, as people can only afford to undertake low paid formal work as a result of their informal incomes. By looking at the informal nature of formal work and practices, informal practices, gift giving, volunteer work and the economies of the household the book is one of the first to give an overview of the nature of the informal economy in all spheres of everyday practice.","tags":["Business","Economics"]},{"id":"53863MIT67130","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Business Leaders Must Address the U.S. STEM Education Gap","authors":["Matt McManus"],"pages":"4","publication_date":"August 2025","description":"U.S. businesses must invest in STEM education — along with scholarships, employee upskilling, diverse hiring, and alternative credentials — to address the talent crisis and maintain competitiveness in AI and technology innovation.

How was it going to survive and succeed in the emerging new era of \"open innovation,\" where collaboration and cooperation between firms, rather than market conquest, would be the keystones of success?\n\nThis was the challenge facing Microsoft founder and Chairman Bill Gates. But \"like Cortez burning his ships at the shores of the New World,\" Gates decided to embrace the change that was needed. He recruited Marshall Phelps—the legendary \"godfather\" of intellectual property who had turned IBM’s IP portfolio into a $2 billion-a-year gold mine—out of retirement and into the cauldron of controversy that was Microsoft. Only this time Phelps’ mission was infinitely more challenging than simply making money from IP. It was to help reform Microsoft’s \"man the barricades\" culture, encourage the company to abandon its fortress mentality around its technology and share it with others for mutual benefit, and use intellectual property not as a weapon of competitive warfare but as a bridge to collaboration with other firms instead.\n\nHere, for the first time (and 500 collaboration deals later), is the inside story of what one analyst has called \"the biggest change Microsoft has undergone since it became a multinational company.\"\n\nIn this book, authors Marshall Phelps and David Kline take the reader inside the dramatic struggle within Microsoft to find a new direction. They offer an extraordinary behind-the-scenes view of the high-level deliberations of the company’s senior-most executives, the internal debates and conflicts among executives and rank-and-file employees alike over the company’s new collaborative direction, and the company’s controversial top-secret partnership building efforts with major open source companies and others around the world. Nothing was held back from this book save for information specifically prohibited from disclosure by confidentiality agreements that Microsoft signed with other companies. Indeed, the degree of access to Microsoft’s inner workings granted to the authors—and the honest self-criticism offered by Microsoft leaders and employees alike—was unprecedented in the company’s 34-year history.\n\nThere are lessons in this book for executives in every industry—most especially on the role that intellectual property can play in liberating previously untapped value in a company and opening up powerful new business opportunities in today’s era of \"open innovation.\" Here is a powerful inside account of the dawn of a new era at what is arguably the most powerful technology company on earth.","tags":["Business","Economics","Next Economy"]},{"id":"9780124166196","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Modeling and Analysis of Real-Time and Embedded Systems with UML and MARTE","authors":["Bran Selic","Sebastien Gerard"],"pages":"314","publication_date":"October 2013","description":"Modeling and Analysis of Real-Time and Embedded Systems with UML and MARTE explains how to apply the complex MARTE standard in practical situations.

The number of American companies listed on the stock market dropped by half between 1996 and 2012. In recent years we've seen some of the most storied corporations go bankrupt (General Motors, Chrysler, Eastman Kodak) or disappear entirely (Bethlehem Steel, Lehman Brothers, Borders). Gerald Davis argues this is a root cause of the income inequality and social instability we face today. Corporations were once an integral part of building the middle class. He points out that in their heyday they offered millions of people lifetime employment, a stable career path, health insurance, and retirement pensions. They were like small private welfare states. The businesses that are replacing them will not fill the same role. For one thing, they employ far fewer people—the combined global workforces of Facebook, Yelp, Zynga, LinkedIn, Zillow, Tableau, Zulily, and Box are smaller than the number of people who lost their jobs when Circuit City was liquidated in 2009. And in the “sharing economy,” companies have no obligation to most of the people who work for them—at the end of 2014 Uber had over 160,000 “driver-partners” in the United States but recognized only about 2,000 people as actual employees.Davis tracks the rise of the large American corporation and the economic, social, and technological developments that have led to its decline. The future could see either increasing economic polarization, as careers turn into jobs and jobs turn into tasks, or a more democratic economy built from the grass roots. It's up to us.","tags":["Business","Economics","Next Economy"]},{"id":"9789353948252","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Express Learning - Computer Graphics and Multimedia","authors":["ITL ESL"],"pages":"350","publication_date":"December 2013","description":"Express Learning is a series of books designed as quick reference guides to important undergraduate courses.

Integrating consideration of human abilities, limitations, and preferences into engineering systems yields important cost and performance benefits that otherwise would not have been accomplished. In order for this new discipline to be effective, however, a cultural change—starting with organizational leadership—is often necessary.\n\nThe Economics of Human Systems Integration explains the difficulties underlying valuation of investments in people's training and education, safety and health, and work productivity. It provides an overview of how the field of economics addresses these difficulties, focusing on human issues associated with design, development, production, operations, maintenance, and sustainment of complex systems.\n\nThe set of thought leaders recruited as contributors to this volume collectively provides a compelling set of data and principles for assessing the economic value of investing in people, not just in general but in specific investment situations. The early chapters provide the contexts for HSI and investment analysis, illustrating the enormous difference context makes in how issues are best framed and analyzed. A host of practical methods and tools for investment valuation are then presented. Provided are:\n\nA variety of real-world applications of economic analysis ranging from military acquisition and automotive investment to healthcare and high-tech investments in general, in both the U.S. and abroad\n\nA range of economics-based methods and tools for cost analysis, cost-benefit analysis, and investment analysis, as well as sources of data for performing such analyses\n\nDiffering perspectives on economic decision-making, including a range of private sector points of view, as well as government and regulatory perspectives\n\nIn addition, five real-world case studies illustrate how such valuations have been done and their major impacts on investment decisions.

In this article, the authors explore the manifestations and costs associated with what they call the “headquarters knows best” syndrome, as well as ways companies can address the problem. Many of the things companies have done are fairly predictable, such as decentralizing global responsibilities, changing the reporting relationships, internationalizing senior management, and creating cross-national teams.\n\nAt Irdeto B.V., a Dutch developer of security software for digital media, the remedy was more extreme: It elected to create two headquarters, one in the Netherlands and the other in China. While this was expensive — and something the CEO’s successor ultimately did away with in 2015 — the decision to operate out of dual headquarters helped the company realign its focus, and it had significant positive effects on Irdeto’s performance.\n\nThe authors argue that many corporate executives aren’t aware that the “headquarters knows best” syndrome exists. Typically, top executives interact with executives from the subsidiaries that are closest to headquarters (in terms of geography, economic development, and culture); the executives’ frame of reference is based on subsidiary managers who benefit from ample attention, autonomy, or influence. Executives from peripheral subsidiaries are the ones who are most likely to be affected and least likely to be heard. In addition, the value of missed opportunities and lost talent is hard to assess, and headquarters executives can easily invoke contextual factors (such as competition for labor) to explain problems. They can also try to pin blame on the local entities.\n\nAfter establishing its dual headquarters in 2007, the authors note, Irdeto saw measurable improvements on four fronts: increased top management attention, greater subsidiary contributions, richer lateral exchanges, and tighter local connections. Although what works for one company may not be right for another, the authors maintain that Irdeto’s experience nonetheless offers broad lessons for companies seeking to eliminate their local biases and become more global. These lessons involve openness to changing the existing structure, a commitment to promoting fairness, and the willingness to learn what it takes to operate virtually.","tags":["Business","Economics","Next Economy"]},{"id":"9781562865313","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Training Across Generations","authors":["Kim.

The high incidence of poverty and the need for increased agricultural productivity remain acute in rural areas of sub-Saharan Africa, where a lack of secure land rights and a growing scarcity of land relative to the size of the population are becoming increasingly critical issues. Indeed, land issues in the region are high on the international policy agenda. Yet our knowledge about land tenure security and other rural factor markets (such as labor, oxen, manure, purchased inputs, and credit) is far from adequate to formulate sensible policies.\n\nThe case studies in the book show that, while land markets and especially informal markets have been rapidly emerging in densely populated parts of Africa - and have generally been to the benefit of the poor--their functions remain imperfect. This is due to policy-induced tenure insecurity and the fragmentation of agricultural land. Applying rigorous quantitative analyses, the book provides a basis for taking into account the role of land markets in national land policies. All too often, the authors argue, land policies have been extreme, either prohibiting all land transactions or giving unrestricted freehold rights to a small elite at the expense of the poor. From the long experience in Asia, it is known that such policies are detrimental to both production efficiency and equity of land use. The authors argue that future policies in Africa should work with the markets. Regulations should be imposed only with careful testing that they are having the intended effects.\n\nThe Emergence of Land Markets in Africa is a resource for teaching in developed and developing countries, as it provides both comprehensive reviews of the literature and detailed case studies. It is intended to facilitate the dialogue between researchers and policymakers, as well as inspire researchers to go further in their investigations and build an even stronger basis for good policies. The Emergence of Land Markets in Africa is the first publication in the new Environment for Development (EfD) book series. EfD books focus on research and applications in environmental and natural resource economics as they are relevant to poverty reduction and environmental problems in developing countries.

Today's 21st century education presents unique challenges and opportunities to students, and this is a trailblazing practical guide to making sure education is ready for the future. #EdJourney focuses on four key questions:\n\nWhat new learning strategies are the top schools implementing to prepare our students for their future rather than for our past?\nHow do teachers and administrators manage transitions to new types of teaching and learning?\nWhat are the key obstacles to shifting away from the assembly line model of education?\nHow can we all leverage the lessons of success from the most innovative schools?\n\nThe concrete examples and advice in this book will help you bring innovation and educational design concepts into your school. #EdJourney goes beyond the theoretical need for change—by now a familiar topic to almost everyone—and takes a real-world approach to achieving transformative education in any school.","tags":["Other","Education"]},{"id":"9788417880781","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Valuism","authors":["María Lladró"],"pages":"160","publication_date":"July 2023","description":"Valuism is a critical and creative thinking essay about the necessary transformations of our global economic system, as well as the values and beliefs that sustain it.","tags":["Business","Economics"]},{"id":"9781631578670","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Accelerating TechnOnomic Medium ('ATOM')","authors":["Kartik Gada"],"pages":"149","publication_date":"June 2017","description":"The accelerating pace and diffusion of technological change has taken control of an ever-growing fraction of the world economy. This fraction is being assimilated into a different set of economic fundamentals, such as the rapid and exponential price deflation inherent to technology. The effect of this was insignificant until recently, but is now beginning to create conspicuous distortions in many economic metrics, and is just years from being the dominant force across the entire economy. In response to technological deflation, the central banks of the world will have to create new money in perpetuity, increasing the stream at an exponentially rising rate much higher than is currently assumed. This now-permanent need for monetary expansion, if embraced, can fund government spending more directly. This in turn creates a very robust, dynamic, and efficient safety net for citizens, while simultaneously reducing and even eliminating most forms of taxation by 2025. Failure to recognize that technological deflation mandates permanent and ever-rising central bank monetary expansion that can and should gradually become the primary source of government spending will precipitate a major financial crisis starting as soon as 2017.","tags":["Business","Economics"]},{"id":"9781606497234","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Fiscal Policy within the IS-LM Framework","authors":["Shahdad Naghshpour"],"pages":"156","publication_date":"January 2014","description":"Undoubtedly, what happens to the economy affects the lives of the citizens of a country, and often the lives of people in other countries around the globe. In addition to natural disasters two things affect the economy more than anything else: monetary and fiscal policies. Fiscal policy and monetary policy represent forms of government intervention to influence market performance. Fiscal policy relates to government spending and revenue collection; monetary policy relates to the supply of money, which is controlled by factors such as reserve requirements and interest rates. If there were a universally accepted set of rules that prescribe appropriate actions to bring and sustain prosperity to the economy the study of economics would have been a positive science, as opposed to a collection of normative beliefs. The study of these policies is normative in nature because fiscal and monetary policies do not necessarily impact everyone equally or in the same way. In other words not everybody loses or gains equally as the result of fiscal and monetary policies. Nevertheless, there are non-normative economic theories that explain the expected outcome of specific fiscal or monetary policies.The economists that advocate for fiscal or monetary policies generally agree on the economic consequences produced by each policy when implemented. What differentiates the economists is the degree to which they believe in the effectiveness of the policy, their ability to know the extent of the need that it is intended to address, the proper amount of intervention required in order to effect the desired correction, and the length of the time it would take to see the consequence of the policy.This book covers fiscal policy. It is part of a projected two volume set covering fiscal and monetary policies. The two volumes will be written to be complimentary to but independent of each other.","tags":["Business","Economics"]},{"id":"9781637424155","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"#Share, 2nd Edition","authors":["Natalie T.

The challenge of economic openness is considered through the globalization of the world economic system by the example of modern Russia. The tendency of archaization of socio-economic relations is explored which is connected with the gradual disappearance of ineffective institutes and their replacement by new institutes.\n\nAttention is paid to the regional aspect of the digital economy – perspectives of development of the ethno-economy in the context of integration of regional economic systems are determined. The problem of preserving social identity and supporting the uniqueness of competitive advantages of the region’s economy in the conditions of digitization is actualized, and its perspective solutions based on a region’s globalization management are offered. Also, the problem of national and regional food security is considered. Increased social significance of the agro-industrial complex and the necessity for its de-economization on the platform of the digital economy are substantiated.\n\nA new concept of the market economy in the conditions of digitization and the Fourth industrial revolution is developed; economic power of technological progress and possibilities of managing and re-directing this power are determined. The authors substantiate the transition to the Sixth technological mode and the related transformation processes in the economy. Also, the authors dwell on the problem of the shadow economy and corruption and consider the perspectives of its overcoming based on the possibilities of digital technologies. The idea of de-regulation based on the possibilities of automatization and AI is opposed to the idea of increase of state regulation based on ubiquitous computing and digital monitoring of economic activities. The perspectives of increasing the economy’s transparency in the digital age are proved.\n\nThe alternatives to the current model of development of the digital economy are given, and scenario analysis of consequences of observing these models based on the cognitive approach is performed. New opportunities for development of the integration processes in entrepreneurship in the conditions of the digital economy are shown – in particular, in the aspect of inter-regional and transnational sectorial clustering. Clusters are considered as growth points of the Russian economy, and the new Russian experience of formation and development of clusters in the sphere of higher education in the context of region’s economy is studied.\n\nThe authors determine the contribution of key technological events in the development of entrepreneurship through the example of modern Russia. They come to the conclusion that despite the unique possibilities digital technologies do not necessarily create additional value for entrepreneurship, and their application could be ineffective due to additional capital expenditures in case of complexity of return of long-term venture investments.\n\nThe needs of entrepreneurship for innovative infrastructural provision in the context of the digital economy are determined, and barriers on the path of its creation and practical application due to necessity for applying new forms of business organization are shown. Specific features of state management of a region’s economy in the conditions of digital modernization are shown, and the modern Russian practice of e-government as a response to the modern challenges is studied. The authors outline new perspectives of development of public-private partnership as an effective direction of industrial and cluster policy of a modern region.","tags":["Business","Economics"]},{"id":"9780071794985","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"The Transformative CEO: IMPACT LESSONS FROM INDUSTRY GAME CHANGERS","authors":["Jeffrey J.

It has been since before the Great Recession of 2008, and the negative trend in American entrepreneurship has been accelerated by the Covid pandemic. New firms are being started at a slower rate, are employing fewer workers, and are being formed disproportionately in just a few major cities in the U.S. At the same time, large chains are opening more locations. Companies such as Amazon with their \"deliver everything and anything\" are rapidly displacing Main Street businesses.\n\nIn The New Builders, we tell the stories of the next generation of entrepreneurs -- and argue for the future of American entrepreneurship. That future lies in surprising places -- and will in particular rely on the success of women, black and brown entrepreneurs. Our country hasn't yet even recognized the identities of the New Builders, let alone developed strategies to support them.\n\nOur misunderstanding is driven by a core misperception. Consider a \"typical\" American entrepreneur. Think about the entrepreneur who appears on TV, the business leader making headlines during the pandemic. Think of the type of businesses she or he is building, the college or business school they attended, the place they grew up.\n\nThe image you probably conjured is that of a young, white male starting a technology business. He's likely in Silicon Valley. Possibly New York or Boston. He's self-confident, versed in the ins and outs of business funding and has an extensive (Ivy League?) network of peers and mentors eager to help his business thrive, grow and make millions, if not billions.\n\nYou’d think entrepreneurship is thriving, and helping the United States maintain its economic power.\n\nYou'd be almost completely wrong.\n\nThe dominant image of an entrepreneur as a young white man starting a tech business on the coasts isn't correct at all. Today's American entrepreneurs, the people who drive critical parts of our economy, are more likely to be female and non-white. In fact, the number of women-owned businesses has increased 31 times between 1972 and 2018 according to the Kauffman Foundation (in 1972, women-owned businesses accounted for just 4.6% of all firms; in 2018 that figure was 40%). The fastest-growing group of female entrepreneurs are women of color, who are responsible for 64% of new women-owned businesses being created.\n\nIn a few years, we believe women will make up more than half of the entrepreneurs in America.\n\nThe age of the average American entrepreneur also belies conventional wisdom: It's 42. The average age of the most successful entrepreneurs -- those in the top .01% in terms of their company's growth in the first five years -- is 45.\n\nThese are the New Builders. Women, people of color, immigrants and people over 40.\n\nWe're failing them. And by doing so, we are failing ourselves.\n\nIn this book, you'll learn:\n\nHow the definition of business success in America today has grown corporate and around the concepts of growth, size, and consumption.\nWhy and how our collective understanding of \"entrepreneurship\" has dangerously narrowed. Once a broad term including people starting businesses of all types, entrepreneurship has come to describe only the brash technology founders on the way to becoming big.\nWho are the fastest growing groups of entrepreneurs? What are they working on? What drives them?\nThe real engine that drove Silicon Valley’s entrepreneurs. The government had a much bigger role than is widely known\nThe extent to which entrepreneurs and small businesses are woven through our history, and the ways we have forgotten women and people of color who owned small businesses in the past.\nHow we're increasingly afraid to fail\nThe role small businesses are playing saving the wilderness, small","tags":["Business","Economics","Next Economy"]},{"id":"9781501502460","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Communication and Learning","authors":["Paul Witt"],"pages":"774","publication_date":"September 2016","description":"In this volume, leading scholars from the fields of communication, educational psychology, and international education address what is known about the strategic role of interpersonal communication in the teaching/learning process.

So Pine and coauthor Kim Korn show you how to create new value for your customers with offerings that fuse the real and the virtual. Think of the Xbox Kinect, which combines virtual video games with a powerful physical dimension—you play by moving your own body; new apps that, when you point your smartphone camera at a real street, overlay digital information about the scene onto the image; and virtual dashboards that track the real world, moment by moment.Digital technology offers limitless opportunities—you really can create anything you want—but real-world experiences have a richness that virtual ones do not. So how can you use the best of both? How do you make sense of such infinite possibility? What kinds of experiences can you create? Which ones should you offer?Pine and Korn provide a profound new tool geared to exploring and exploiting the digital frontier.

By shedding new light on how IGA relates to FEM, we can see how IGA can be implemented on top of an FE code in order to improve the solution of problems that require more regularity. This is illustrated by using IGA with FEM in a non-invasive fashion to perform efficient and robust multiscale global/local simulations in solid mechanics.

This is an important book well worth reading.” -- John A. Allison, President and CEO, Cato Institute, and author of the New York Times bestselling The Financial Crisis and the Free Market Cure\n\n“Few topics today are as misunderstood as the subject of money. Steve Forbes understands money better than most heads of state do, and in this provocative book he shares his vast knowledge and gives us sensible and time-tested recommendations for stopping future financial meltdowns.” -- Lawrence Kudlow, CNBC Senior Contributor\n\n“Economic and monetary policies can be difficult to master for even the savviest politicians. Money effectively communicates these complexities into a cohesive argument for economic recovery and preventing a new financial crisis. Steve Forbes and Elizabeth Ames deliver a gripping read and an intriguing viewpoint on how to get our economy back on track.” --Greta Van Susteren, host of On the Record, Fox News Channel\n\nFew topics are as misunderstood today as the subject of money. Since the U.S. abandoned a gold-linked dollar more than four decades ago, the world’s governments have slid into a dangerous ignorance of the fundamental monetary principles that guided the world’s most successful economies for centuries. Today’s wrong-headed monetary policies are now setting the stage for a new global economic and social catastrophe that could rival the recent financial crisis and even the horrors of the 1930s. Coauthored by Steve Forbes, one of the world’s leading experts on finance, Money shows you why that doesn’t need to happen--and how to prevent it.\n\nAfter reading this entertaining and hugely well-informed book, you will know more about money than most people in the highest government positions today. Money explains why a return to sound money is absolutely essential if the U.S. and other nations are ever to overcome today’s problems. Stable money, Steve Forbes and Elizabeth Ames argue, is the only way to a true recovery and a stable and prosperous economy.\n\nToday’s system of fluctuating “fiat” money, in which governments manipulate the value of the dollar and other currencies, has been responsible for the biggest economic failures of recent decades, including the 2008 financial crisis, from whose effects we continue to suffer. The Obama/Bernanke/Yellen Federal Reserve and its unstable dollar policies are accelerating our course toward disaster, the authors show, in numerous convincing examples. In Money, Forbes and Ames answer these crucial questions:\n\nWhat is the difference between money and value? What is real wealth?\n\nHow does sound money contribute to a well-functioning society?\n\nHow have our money policy errors led to the current problems in global financial markets?\n\nWhat can we do now to reestablish the strength of the dollar and other currencies?\n\nThe authors argue that the most effective way to return to a sound money policy and a healthy economy is to put the dollar back on a gold standard, and they outline the several different forms a gold standard could take. They also share invaluable suggestions for how to preserve our wealth and where to invest our money.\n\nMoney is essential reading for anyone interested in this crucially important subject.","tags":["Business","Economics"]},{"id":"9781439880081","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Local Economic Development and the Environment","authors":["Susan M.

A valuable guide for new engineers, economists (or forecasters), regulators, and policy makers who want to further develop their knowledge of best practice calculations techniques or experienced practitioners (and even managers) who desire to acquire more useful tips, this book offers expert advice for using such cost models to determine optimally-sized distribution systems and optimally-structured power supplying entities. In other words, this book provides an Everything-that-you-want-to-know-about-cost-modelling-for-electric-utilities (but were afraid to ask) approach to modelling the cost of supplying electricity. In addition, the author covers the concept of multiproduct and multistage cost functions, which are appropriate in modelling the cost of supplying electricity. The author has done all the heavy number-crunching, and provides the reader with real-world, practical examples of how to properly quantify the costs associated with providing electric service, thus increasing the accuracy of the results and support for the policy initiatives required to ensure the competitiveness of the power suppliers in this new world in which we are living.\n\nThe principles contained herein could be employed to assist in the determination of the cost-minimizing amount of output (i.e., electricity), which could then be used to determine whether a merger between two entities makes sense (i.e., would increase profitability).

These programs are typically based on step-by-step numerical integrations of power system stability models to simulate system dynamic behaviors. Unfortunately, this offline practice is inadequate to deal with current operating environments. For years, direct methods have held the promise of providing real-time stability assessments; however, these methods have presented several challenges and limitations.\n\nThis book addresses these challenges and limitations with the BCU methods developed by author Hsiao-Dong Chiang. To date, BCU methods have been adopted by twelve major utility companies in Asia and North America. In addition, BCU methods are the only direct methods adopted by the Electric Power Research Institute in its latest version of DIRECT 4.0.\n\nEverything you need to take full advantage of BCU methods is provided, including:\n\nTheoretical foundations of direct methods\n\nTheoretical foundations of energy functions\n\nBCU methods and their theoretical foundations\n\nGroup-based BCU method and its applications\n\nNumerical studies on industrial models and data\n\nArmed with a solid foundation in the underlying theory of direct methods, energy functions, and BCU methods, you'll discover how to efficiently solve complex practical problems in stability analysis.

To spread their messages and encourage people to connect and interact with one another, stakeholders are now deploying a variety of channels, including websites, user forums, e-newsletters, videos, and social media platforms. By following the connections among their various media, the authors have observed the ways these stakeholder groups find and influence one another, building their communities and aligning with others who share similar objectives. Individually, many of these stakeholders may be powerless, but together, they can have a huge impact on how a crisis evolves. Moreover, by creating their own media, these stakeholders can bypass the “gatekeepers” of traditional media: the editors and journalists who in the past decided what news was fit to publish.\n\nTo understand the role of stakeholder-controlled media in controlling how a corporate crisis unfolds, the authors investigated numerous events in which stakeholders seemed to dictate how the action played out. In those crises, they found that the stakeholders were able to leverage three key assets: frontline information, their own news channels, and the ability to determine when and how a crisis ends. The authors offer recommendations about how companies should respond to stakeholder concerns during a crisis.","tags":["Business","Economics","Next Economy"]},{"id":"9781430263494","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Business Journalism: How to Report on Business and Economics","authors":["Keith Hayes"],"pages":"248","publication_date":"January 2014","description":"Business Journalism: How to Report on Business and Economics is a basic guide for journalists working in countries moving to open-market economies, students in journalism courses, journalists changing direction from general news reporting to business and economic reporting, and bloggers.

Using the ideas that are central to how markets and economics and dating work, Oyer shows how you can apply these ideas to take advantage of the economics in everyday life, all around you, all the time.For all online datersand for anyone else swimming in the vast sea of the information economythis book uses Oyer’s own experiences, and those of millions of others, to help you navigate the key economic concepts that drive the modern age.","tags":["Business","Economics"]},{"id":"758505","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Write Better Behavorial Objectives—Instructional Systems Development","authors":["M.

Umair Haque argues that just as positive psychology revolutionized our understanding of mental health by recasting the field as more than just treating mental illness, we need to rethink our economic paradigm. Why? Because business as we know it has reached a state of diminishing returnsthough we work harder and harder, we never seem to get anywhere. This has led to a diminishing of the common wealth: wage stagnation, widening economic inequality, the depletion of the natural world, and more. To get out of this trap, we need to rethink the future of human exchange.

The result is imbalances between aggregate supply and aggregate demand that can cause economic contractions. These imbalances may be self-correcting, or they may become long-lived and require government intervention through the exercise of corrective monetary and fiscal policy.\n\nVolume I examines economic behavior on the assumption that economic agents correctly interpret the data before them. It thus takes a “micro foundations” approach, under which aggregate supply equals aggregate demand.\n\nVolume II allows for the possibility of myopia on the part of economic agents and for the resulting economic malperformance that can result from this myopia. It examines the short-run disparities between aggregate supply and aggregate demand that can result from ill-informed choices of individual economic agents or from a misdiagnosis of economic data by policy makers. It concludes with a review of recent U.S. economic policy.\n\nThe book aims to correct a good number of misconceptions that bedevil economic policymaking—among them the idea that protracted economic contractions necessarily call for increased government spending and lower taxes. It challenges the common understanding that government deficits raise interest rates and “crowd out” private investment.","tags":["Business","Economics"]},{"id":"9780749468996","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Complete Training","authors":["Robin Hoyle"],"pages":"272","publication_date":"May 2013","description":"Complete Training is a practical, comprehensive guide to implementing effective learning throughout an organization catering to the needs of every employee from recruitment to retirement.","tags":["Business","Human Resources","Employee Training"]},{"id":"9780749465568","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Emotional Fitness Coaching","authors":["Warren Redman"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"June 2012","description":"Emotional Fitness Coaching is the practical approach to applying the principles of emotional intelligence to the workplace to create a healthy, positive and creative environment in every situation.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Communication","Emotional Intelligence"]},{"id":"9780749450786","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"The Experiential Learning Toolkit","authors":["Colin Beard"],"pages":"288","publication_date":"July 2010","description":"Better understand experiential learning across a range of cultures and contexts, from education to corporate training, with this popular book.","tags":["Other","Education"]},{"id":"9780133382761","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"From Financial Crisis to Recovery (Collection)","authors":["Mark Zandi"],"pages":"593","publication_date":"December 2012","description":"A new collection of objective, authoritative insights into the American economy: 2 authoritative books by top economist Mark Zandi, now in a convenient e-format, at a great price!\n\n2 authoritative eBooks offer a realistic, non-ideological, and actionable view of the U.S. economy: what’s happened, where we stand, and where we’re headed\n\nGet past politics and ideology: gain an objective understanding of where America’s economy stands, where it’s headed, and the best ways to improve it for the long-term. Moody Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi – who’s advised leaders in both political parties and every sector of the economy – now offers the deep insights you need to make intelligent plans as an investor, businessperson, employee, and citizen. In the new updated edition of Financial Shock: Global Panic and Government Bailouts--How We Got Here and What Must Be Done to Fix It, Zandi offers timely insights into the market meltdown and the Obama administration’s policy responses, bringing objective insight to the crucial question: why did the U.S. economy collapse, and how can we keep it from happening again? He outlines the true roles of mortgage lenders, investment bankers, speculators, the real estate industry, regulators, the Fed, and homebuyers… previews tomorrow’s most worrisome areas of global financial risk… and offers realistic policies for preventing the next dangerous shocks. Then, in Paying the Price: Ending the Great Recession and Ensuring a New American Century, Zandi takes stock of the American economy as it stands now, reviewing the progress towards recovery, and outlining what still needs to be done. Zandi offers a surprisingly optimistic diagnosis: one of growth, stability in the housing markets, a safer financial system, lower household debt. He thoughtfully reviews the key problems that still remain, from mounting government debt to the growth of disenfranchised workers, outlining the progress that has -- and hasn’t -- been made.

However, most people recognize that even though the recession was said to be over, its after-effects lingered well into the next decade, and even in 2017, some ten years later, governments in America and around the world were struggling with problems of low growth, wage stagnation and high poverty. Most economists were caught off guard, and they began to look for new ideas that may be appropriately called NEW MACROECONOMICS. This book examines conventional economics in the context of recent developments. It shows that a new theory, known as the wage-productivity model, explains almost every macro-economic experience of the global economy since 1980. You have to read this theory to believe it.

The expectational Phillips curve may be used to examine the economic aspects of this interrelation. Macroeconomic politics relates to voter behavior, presidential reelection ambition, partisan economic priorities, and special interests. These factors impact the fiscal and monetary policy actions of the president, Congress, and central bank. According to the electoral effect, presidents attempt to boost the economy before an election to increase reelection votes.\n\nAccording to the partisan effect, conservative presidencies are relatively inflation averse, while liberal administrations are relatively unemployment averse. The evidence, however, suggests that the electoral and partisan effects occurred idiosyncratically in the U.S. economy during 1961–2016. The economy also affects presidential approval, Congressional elections, consumer sentiment, voter participation, and macropartisanship. An international dimension of the political macroeconomy is the issue of free trade versus protectionism and the perspectives of economic liberalism, neomercantilism, and structuralism.","tags":["Business","Economics"]},{"id":"9780749463564","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Emotional Intelligence Coaching","authors":["Stephen Neale","Lisa Spencer-Arnell","Liz Wilson"],"pages":"270","publication_date":"September 2011","description":"Emotional Intelligence Coaching describes how to assess and manage the emotions of one's self, or others.

The extractive economy we live with now enables the financial elite to squeeze out maximum gain for themselves, heedless of damage to people or planet. But Marjorie Kelly and Ted Howard show that there is a new economy emerging focused on helping everyone thrive while respecting planetary boundaries.  At a time when competing political visions are at stake the world over, this book urges a move beyond tinkering at the margins to address the systemic crisis of our economy. Kelly and Howard outline seven principles of what they call a Democratic Economy: community, inclusion, place (keeping wealth local), good work (putting labor before capital), democratized ownership, ethical finance, and sustainability. Each principle is paired with a place putting it into practice: Pine Ridge, Preston, Portland, Cleveland, and more.This book tells stories not just of activists and grassroots leaders but of the unexpected accomplices of the Democratic Economy. Seeds of a future beyond corporate capitalism and state socialism are being planted in hospital procurement departments, pension fund offices, and even company boardrooms. The road to a system grounded in community, democracy, and justice remains uncertain.

One of the most widely acclaimed journalists on food security, Alan Bjerga is up to the task, taking readers from the trading floor of Chicago to the highlands of East Africa to the rice paddies of Thailand on a global trek to find the causes of the food-price crisis and the solutions.","tags":["Business","Economics"]},{"id":"9781422184318","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Conquering the Chaos","authors":["Ravi Venkatesan"],"pages":"224","publication_date":"May 2013","description":"India is back! With the country’s general elections in 2014 resulting in a government formed by a new political party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, led by a business-friendly prime minister, Narendra Kumar Modi, the world’s largest democracy is once again on the minds of business leaders the world over. The renewal of interest in India is all the greater because of what’s happening in neighboring China. For over thirty years, China was the growth engine for many Western multinational companies, but the combination of a slowing economy, rising wages, and increasing political risk has most companies looking for the next China. No other country is better positioned to play that role than India. In the short term, though, India will remain a challenging market, with a well-deserved reputation for corruption, uncertainty, and stultifying bureaucracy. Those hurdles are unlikely to go away soon. Yet India may be on the verge of unprecedented growth. Can you afford to wait or should you plunge into this complex market today? What does it really take to win there? How do executives deal with India’s volatility, uncertainty, and intense competitionand even prosper from it? Ravi Venkatesan, the former Chairman of Microsoft India and Cummins India, offers expert advice on how your company can overcome the unique challenges of the Indian market. He argues that India is in fact an archetype for most developing nations, many of which present similar challenges. Succeeding in India is important not just because it is a big market but also because it is a litmus test for your corporation’s ability to succeed in other emerging markets. If you can win in India, you should be able to win anywhere. Hard as these frontier markets are, Venkatesan argues, the bigger hurdle may well be the internal culture and mind-set at a multinational’s headquarters. The unwillingness to make a long-term commitment or to adequately trust local leadership, combined with the propensity to rigidly replicate the products, business models, and operating systems that have worked at home, drives many companies into a midway trap.” That often results in India remaining an irrelevantly small contributor to the company’s global growth and profits. Combining personal experience and in-depth interviews with CEOs and senior leaders at dozens of companiesincluding Microsoft, GE, JCB, Dell, Honeywell, Volvo, Bosch, Deere, Unilever, and NestléVenkatesan shows you how to tackle political changes, policy uncertainty, and corruption and thrive in India. He proves that you can break through, but it takes a very different type of leadership, both locally and at corporate headquarters. If you want to succeed in the twenty-first century, you must succeed in emerging markets. This practical book, written by one of India’s most respected CEOs, gives you the keys to win in India, other emerging markets, and, indeed, globally.","tags":["Business","Economics","Next Economy"]},{"id":"9780080492230","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Real Time UML Workshop for Embedded Systems","authors":["Bruce Powel Douglass"],"pages":"432","publication_date":"April 2011","description":"This practical new book provides much-needed, practical, hands-on experience capturing analysis and design in UML.

This book's unique focus on the reality of today's markets makes it an invaluable resource for students and practitioners seeking a comprehensive guide to more accurate forecasting. While most books treat the economy as if it were in a vacuum, building models around idealized or perception-biased behaviors, this book deals with the economy as it currently stands—in a state of recovery, limited by financial constraints, imperfect information, and lags and disparities in price movements. The authors identify how these characteristics impact various markets' behaviors, and quantify those behaviors using SAS as the primary statistical tool.\n\nToday's economy bears a number of unique attributes that usual modeling methods fail to consider. This book describes how to approach modeling based on real-world, observable data in order to make better-informed decisions in today's markets.\n\nDiscover the three economic characteristics with the greatest impact on various markets\nCreate economic models that mirror the current post-recession reality\nAdopt statistical methods that identify and adapt to structural breaks and lags\nFactor real-world imperfections into modeling for more accurate forecasting\n\nThe past few years have shown a clear demarcation between policymakers' forecasts and actual outcomes.

Either they collapsed in chaos, or society returned to commodity money before that could happen. Drawing upon novel new research, Paper Money Collapse conclusively illustrates why paper money systems—those based on an elastic and constantly expanding supply of money as opposed to a system of commodity money of essentially fixed supply—are inherently unstable and why they must lead to economic disintegration.\n\nThese highly controversial conclusions clash with the present consensus, which holds that elastic state money is superior to inflexible commodity money (such as a gold standard), and that expanding money is harmless or even beneficial for as long as inflation stays low. Contradicting this, Paper Money Collapse shows that:\n\nThe present crisis is the unavoidable result of continuously expanding fiat money\n\nThe current policy of accelerated money production to \"stimulate\" the economy is counterproductive and could lead to a complete collapse of the monetary system\n\nWhy many in financial markets, in media, and in the policy establishment are unable (and often unwilling) to fully appreciate the underlying problems with elastic money\n\nThis compelling new book looks at the breakdown of modern economic theory and the fallacy of mathematical models. It is an analysis of the current financial crisis and shows in very stark terms that the solutions presented by paper money-enthusiasts around the world are misguided and inherently flawed.","tags":["Business","Economics"]},{"id":"9781118841549","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Implement, Improve and Expand Your Statewide Longitudinal Data System: Creating a Culture of Data in Education","authors":["Jamie McQuiggan","Armistead W.

Would it make any difference, to the overall function of the economy, earnings, employment, etc., if a given sum of money is spent by an individual, a small business, a corporation, or the government? Is it good for the country if people spend money or is it better if they save it? Would it make a difference if spending originates from printing money or citizens’ savings?

Greater market freedom has spread since the end of the Cold War, and with it institutional changes which have further assisted emerging economies in becoming more productive, flexible, and resilient. The Western financial crisis from 2008 has quickened the pace of the relative rise of emerging markets - their relative economic power, and with it political power, but also their financial power as savers, investors and creditors.\n\nEmerging Markets in an Upside Down World - Challenging Perceptions in Asset Allocation and Investment argues that finance theory has misunderstood risk and that this has led to poor investment decisions; and that emerging markets constitute a good example of why traditional finance theory is faulty. The book accurately describes the complex and changing global environment currently facing the investor and asset allocator. It raises many questions often bypassed because of the use of simplifying assumptions and models.

Whether broadly in favour or against these changes, the vast majority of these frameworks employ ahistorical analyses that cannot conceptualise, let alone address, the questions of \"why have these changes occurred?\" and \"why now?\"\n\nThis book argues that the fundamental underlying problem in all cases is the ontological shallowness of these theories, which can only be remedied by attention to ontological presuppositions. Accordingly, Tyfield sets out an introduction to the existing literature on the economics of science together with novel discussion of the field from a critical realist perspective in ways that also develop critical realism as a philosophical project. The first of two volumes, this book explores substantive illustrations of the social challenges associated with the commercialization of science before turning to a critical engagement with critical realism’s critique of mainstream economics that underpins the project as a whole.","tags":["Business","Economics"]},{"id":"9780323988667","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Quadrupoles in Electron Lens Design","authors":["Martin Hÿtch","Peter W.

As such, electrical energy storage is becoming more vital today than at any time in human history. Electrochemical systems, such as batteries, supercapacitors, fuel cells, and photoelectrochemical cells, can help meet this objective. Future generations of rechargeable lithium batteries will be required to power portable electronic devices, store electricity from renewable sources, and serve as a vital component to pursuing electric mobility in the future to reduce fossil fuel demand and mitigate environmental issues. In this context, engineering of new materials, especially at the nanoscale, has become imperative to achieve enhanced energy and power density to meet the future challenges of energy storage.\n\nThis book outlines the state of the art of nanoscale aspects of advanced energy storage devices, such as lithium-ion batteries, including microbatteries and electrochemical supercapacitors. It focuses on various fundamental issues related to device performance of various positive and negative electrode materials, with special reference to their nanoscale advantages. It also includes fundamentals and processing techniques with regard to synthesis, characterization, physical, and electrochemical properties, and applications of nanoscale materials pertaining to advanced electrochemical power sources. A variety of advanced nanomaterials, such as transition metal oxides, phosphates, silicates, and conversion electrodes, together with some special nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes, nanorods, and mesoporous carbons are discussed by many notable authorities in the field.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Engineering","Electrical Engineering","Batteries"]},{"id":"9780132617178","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"How to Implement a Seeds of Prosperity Policy Blueprint","authors":["Glenn Hubbard","Peter Navarro"],"pages":"10","publication_date":"November 2010","description":"This Element is an excerpt from Seeds of Destruction: Why the Path to Economic Ruin Runs Through Washington, and How to Reclaim American Prosperity (9780137027736) by Glenn Hubbard and Peter Navarro.

Martin"],"pages":"256","publication_date":"September 2020","description":"American democratic capitalism is in danger. How can we save it?\n\nFor its first two hundred years, the American economy exhibited truly impressive performance. The combination of democratically elected governments and a capitalist system worked, with ever-increasing levels of efficiency spurred by division of labor, international trade, and scientific management of companies. By the nation's bicentennial celebration in 1976, the American economy was the envy of the world.\n\nBut since then, outcomes have changed dramatically. Growth in the economic prosperity of the average American family has slowed to a crawl, while the wealth of the richest Americans has skyrocketed. This imbalance threatens the American democratic capitalist system and our way of life.\n\nIn this bracing yet constructive book, world-renowned business thinker Roger Martin starkly outlines the fundamental problem: We have treated the economy as a machine, pursuing ever-greater efficiency as an inherent good. But efficiency has become too much of a good thing. Our obsession with it has inadvertently shifted the shape of our economy, from a large middle class and smaller numbers of rich and poor (think of a bell-shaped curve) to a greater share of benefits accruing to a thin tail of already-rich Americans (a Pareto distribution).\n\nWith lucid analysis and engaging anecdotes, Martin argues that we must stop treating the economy as a perfectible machine and shift toward viewing it as a complex adaptive system in which we seek a fundamental balance of efficiency with resilience. To achieve this, we need to keep in mind the whole while working on the component parts; pursue improvement, not perfection; and relentlessly tweak instead of attempting to find permanent solutions.\n\nFilled with keen economic insight and advice for citizens, executives, policy makers, and educators, When More Is Not Better is the must-read guide for saving democratic capitalism.","tags":["Business","Economics"]},{"id":"9780240516622","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Introduction to SNG and ENG Microwave","authors":["Jonathan Higgins"],"pages":"224","publication_date":"July 2013","description":"An excellent primer on the subject, this book gives beginning professionals in satellite newsgathering an introduction to the technologies and processes involved.

A complete understanding of this process is timely and necessary, as the electronics industry moves toward the use of renewable energy sources and widely varying loads that can be adequately supported only by power converters using nonlinear controllers.\n\nOf the various advanced control methods used to handle the complex requirements of power conversion systems, sliding mode control (SMC) has been most widely investigated and proved to be a more feasible alternative than fuzzy and adaptive control for existing and future power converters. Bridging the gap between power electronics and control theory, this book employs a top-down instructional approach to discuss traditional and modern SMC techniques. Covering everything from equations to analog implantation, it:\n\nProvides a comprehensive general overview of SMC principles and methods\n\nOffers advanced readers a systematic exposition of the mathematical machineries and design principles relevant to construction of SMC, then introduces newer approaches\n\nDemonstrates the practical implementation and supporting design rules of SMC, based on analog circuits\n\nPromotes an appreciation of general nonlinear control by presenting it from a practical perspective and using familiar engineering terminology\n\nWith specialized coverage of modeling and implementation that is useful to students and professionals in electrical and electronic engineering, this book clarifies SMC principles and their application to power converters. Making the material equally accessible to all readers, whether their background is in analog circuit design, power electronics, or control engineering, the authors—experienced researchers in their own right—elegantly and practically relate theory, application, and mathematical concepts and models to corresponding industrial targets.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Engineering","Electrical Engineering"]},{"id":"9780071806138","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"F-Commerce Handbook","authors":["Paul Marsden","Paul Chaney"],"pages":"97","publication_date":"June 2012","description":"The 10 Secrets to Selling on the World’s #1 Social Network\n\nFacebook is the perfect tool for reaching out to customers.

He drove the future forward and never looked back. His company, International Data Group (IDG), quickly became a global powerhouse with information technology publications in markets around the world. IDG broke new ground in the 1980s by opening offices in China, the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, and other markets deemed off-limits. IDG thrived across a series of technology and media industry shifts— from mainframe computers to minicomputers to personal computers, from print to digital, and through into the age of the Internet and smartphones—that upended many rivals. Living at the intersection of these classic disruptions, McGovern never missed a beat. And he understood well before most that a revolution in information technology was underway and not only was there money to be made but that this business would soon become the world’s largest industry. His leadership in the creation of one of the world’s leading brain research institutes at MIT only served to cement his legacy. His bold vision and fearless risk-taking made McGovern a legend among leaders. In today’s ever-changing global marketplace, his leadership lessons are more timely and important than ever.\nIn Future Forward, leaders will find 10 essential lessons that can be easily applied to any business, from small startups to giant corporations. These include: “Let’s try it. Encourage entrepreneurial behavior and back it up with serious commitment.” “Decentralize. When building a global empire, every market is local.” “Love your employees.

In Seeds of Destruction, former Bush chief White House economist R. Glenn Hubbard and well-known CNBC commentator Peter Navarro explain why current economic policy is a catastrophic failure. Then, they offer a comprehensive, bipartisan blueprint for reversing the decline of America's currency, manufacturing base, and standard of living - setting the stage for the epic policy debates that will precede the 2010 elections. Hubbard and Navarro begin with a \"checklist\" of what it takes to be a prosperous, democratic nation - and show why Obama's policies (some of Bush's also) fail on every level. They explain why the activist Federal Reserve and Obama fiscal stimulus policies are doing far more harm than good... why we must restore the U.S. manufacturing base, whatever China says about it... how to transform tax policy into an engine of growth and innovation... how to apply the \"tough love\" needed to save Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid... why America must resign the job of world policeman... how market-based solutions can finally deliver real energy independence... how to reform our antique financial regulatory system without imposing heavy-handed rules that cause even more trouble.","tags":["Business","Economics"]},{"id":"9781562867553","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Technical Training Basics","authors":["Sarah Wakefield"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"December 2011","description":"Technical training involves teaching specialized complex tasks and work; and is considered \"the other side of the coin\" to those soft skills training sessions like leadership development and interpersonal skills.

As a result, this heightened awareness enhanced the well-being of society.\n\nIn 1969, the Nobel Foundation initiated the new prize category of economic sciences and started awarding the prize annually. At the forefront of their field, prize winners have introduced many innovative ideas. Moreover, an evaluation of their ideas reveals valuable nuggets to enrich the professional lives of non-economists.\n\nDrawing on publications written by the Laureates, Striding with Economic Giants presents the essence of their thoughts in easy-to-understand concepts for the business and academic communities. This book is perfect for business executives, public policy makers, and economics students.\n\nIt describes logic and experimental frameworks in mathematics, econometrics, behavior modeling, and game theory. Next, Striding presents microeconomic contributions, including production theory, theory of institutions, fundamental ideas of markets, and consumerism. Then, it reviews financial theory in capital markets, portfolio choice, and asset pricing.\n\nThe book spotlights contributions to the rule of law, public administration, and political science. It also highlights a growing understanding of human capital by tracing demographic trends and describing health, education, minority, and labor economics. Enhancements to macroeconomic theory are featured in economic mechanisms and cycles, managing the economy, and policy making.\n\nStriding explores the modernization process by outlining the economics of agriculture, growth theories of economic development, and problems with growth.

Our current version of capitalism — the corporate, globalized version 2.0 — is rapidly squandering this heritage. Now, Peter Barnes offers a solution: protect the commons by giving it property rights and strong institutional managers.\n\nBarnes shows how capitalism — like a computer — is run by an operating system. Our current operating system gives too much power to profit-maximizing corporations that devour the commons and distribute most of their profits to a sliver of the population. And government — which in theory should defend the commons — is all too often a tool of those very corporations.\n\nBarnes proposes a revised operating system — Capitalism 3.0 — that protects the commons while preserving the many strengths of capitalism as we know it. His major innovation is the commons trust, a market based legal entity with the power to limit the use of scare commons, charge rent, and pay dividends — in both cash and services — to everyone.\n\nIn Barnes' vision, an array of commons trusts would institutionalize our obligations to future generations, fellow citizens, and nature. Once established, they'd use markets and property rights to create a better world for us all.\n\nCapitalism 3.0 offers a practical alternative to our current flawed economic system. It points the way to a future in which we can retain capitalism's virtues while mitigating its vices.","tags":["Business","Economics"]},{"id":"9781118856185","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Right on the Money: Doug Casey on Economics, Investing, and the Ways of the Real World with Louis James","authors":["Doug Casey"],"pages":"400","publication_date":"December 2013","description":"Your favorite financial contrarian spreads the wealth in interviews on forty separate topics\n\nInvestment guru Doug Casey made headlines with the financial approach he advocated in Totally Incorrect.

Tuerck"],"pages":"148","publication_date":"June 2022","description":"There is controversy among economists over just what it is that economists should do.\n\nThe controversy is centered on the question whether what is called “neoclassical” or “mainstream” economics provides the appropriate template for performing economic analysis. Neoclassical economics is based on the principle that economic behavior is guided by “rational choice,” i.e., choice based on reason rather than sentiment.\n\nChallenges to this principle come from several fields of study: behavioral economics, neuroeconomics, Austrian economics, Keynesian economics, and others. A common thread running through these fields is that the rational choice assumption is unrealistic and therefore not useful for analyzing economic policy choices.\n\nIt is important, however, to distinguish between economic policy choices, which are frequently irrational, and how individuals are observed to react to these choices. Examples of irrational policy choices are minimum wage laws, buy-American rules, and corporate tax increases. The job of the economist is to play a role akin to that of preachers, in exposing such choices for their irrationality. Mainstream economics shows that people react to these choices in a manner that impairs the performance of the economy.","tags":["Business","Economics"]},{"id":"9781953946133","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"DEI&B Education for Employees","authors":["ATD Research"],"pages":"38","publication_date":"August 2021","description":"In recent years, many organizations have launched new diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging (DEI&B) initiatives and expanded existing ones to educate employees around DEI&B concepts, skills, and policies.

The mere threat of litigation and the prospect of a prolonged lawsuit are often all that is necessary to persuade a smaller business to acquiesce to the larger competitor's legal demands. The author writes about a defensive strategy he calls \"lawsourcing\" that turns the tables on large companies by gathering public support, typically through social media and public relations.\n\nThe idea of lawsourcing - which is a variation of what has become known as \"crowdsourcing\" - isn't completely new. Back in 1984, when Ben & Jerry's Homemade Inc. was a six-year-old upstart in the ice cream business, Pillsbury (then the owner of the Häagen-Dazs ice cream brand) attempted to pressure some of its distributors not to handle Ben & Jerry's products. Ben & Jerry's fought back hard, with a scrappy campaign built around the slogan \"What's the Doughboy Afraid Of?\"\n\nWell-executed lawsourcing campaigns can deliver significant benefits to companies, including greater brand awareness and loyalty and increased sales. The author cites a number of examples, including:\n\nHampton Creek Foods Inc., a small San Francisco-based food producer. In the fall of 2014, Unilever, owner of the Hellmann's brand of mayonnaise, filed suit against Hampton Creek for using the word \"mayo\" to describe its vegan mayonnaise substitute, called Just Mayo. Hampton Creek fought back by commenting about the lawsuit on Twitter and Facebook and engaging with media sympathetic to its plight. Unilever withdrew its lawsuit.\n\nVermont artist Bo Muller-Moore, who sells T-shirts adorned with the slogan \"Eat More Kale.\" Atlanta-based fast-food chain Chik-fil-A Inc. claimed that Muller-Moore's slogan infringed upon its federal trademark rights to the phrase \"Eat Mor Chikin.\" After a spirited social media campaign, Muller-Moore got his own trademark.\n\nTesla Motors Inc., which is challenging state franchise regulations that restrict Tesla from selling cars directly to consumers. Tesla's strategy leverages company CEO Elon Musk's strong social media presence and the company's blog to inform sympathizers about the issues and urge them to tell regulators of their opposition to regulations restricting direct sales.The author notes several common themes for effective lawsourcing campaigns, including a compelling story; strong, engaged social media campaigns; direct appeals for support; leveraging social media for mainstream media exposure; and being authentic and following one's instincts.","tags":["Business","Economics","Next Economy"]},{"id":"9781523084586","language":"en","level":null,"title":"The Memo","authors":["John Hope Bryant"],"publication_date":"September 2017","description":"True power in this world comes from economic independence, but too many people have too much month left at the end of their money. John Hope Bryant, founder and CEO of Operation HOPE, illuminates the path toward liberation that is hiding in plain sight. His message is simple: the supermajority of people who live in poverty, whom Bryant calls the invisible class, as well as millions in the struggling middle class, haven't gotten “the memo”—until now. Building on his personal experience of rising up from economically disadvantaged circumstances and his work with Operation HOPE, Bryant teaches readers five rules that lay the foundation for achieving financial freedom. He emphasizes the inseparable connection between “inner capital” (mindset, relationships, knowledge, and spirit) and “outer capital” (financial wealth and property). “If you have inner capital,” Bryant writes, “you can never be truly poor. If you lack inner capital, all the money in the world cannot set you free.” Bryant gives readers tools for empowerment by covering everything from achieving basic financial literacy to investing in positive relationships and approaching wealth with a completely new attitude. He makes this bold and controversial claim: “Once you have satisfied your basic sustenance needs—food, water, health, and a roof over your head—poverty has more to do with your head than your wallet.” Bryant wants to restore readers' “silver rights,” giving them the ability to succeed and prosper no matter what very real roadblocks society puts in their way. We have more power than we realize, if only we can recognize and claim it. “We are our first capital,” Bryant writes. “We are the CEOs of our own lives.”","tags":["Business","Economics"]},{"id":"9780132476096","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Africa: The Tenth Largest Economy in the World","authors":["Vijay Mahajan"],"pages":"10","publication_date":"February 2010","description":"This Element is an excerpt from Africa Rising: How 900 Million African Consumers Offer More Than You Think (ISBN: 9780132339421) by Vijay Mahajan. Available in print and digital formats.\n\nThe surprising numbers: why Africa is a larger market than you ever realized.\n\nIf Africa were a single country, according to World Bank data, it would have had $978 billion total gross national income in 2006.

In this view, the essential pillars of strategic success arenonsubstitutable resources and inimitable capabilities, and competitive advantage stems from uniqueand scarce resources.However, the authors argue that competing on unique, rare and inimitable resources can be risky,because acquiring and protecting such resources can be costly; after all, most companies in an industryare seeking to obtain them. The authors contend that ordinary resources may play an overlooked butimportant role in successful strategies — and competing with ordinary resources can be a valuablecomplement to competing with strategic resources.An ordinary resource is a common resource on the market, generally perceived as neutral in termsof performance. Such a resource is considered, at best, as ensuring competitive parity. While ordinaryresources are not, in and of themselves, a source of competitive advantage and greater performance,they are generally required for the business to function properly. Examples of ordinary resourcesinclude compliance with ISO standards in the automobile industry; stores and salespeople in retailing;and websites and logistics competencies in e-commerce.Unless ordinary resources are leveraged, strategic resources cannot always deliver their full-fledgedcompetitive potential. In particular, the use of ordinary resources enables the duplication of a businessmodel in many business units and/or in many countries. For instance, McDonald’s Corp. is the world’slargest chain of fast-food restaurants. But the replication of the McDonald’s business model is possiblespecifically because the model leverages relatively ordinary resources, in the form of more than 1.8 million employees worldwide. Most entry-level McDonald’s employees are not highly qualified, are part-time workers and can be easily replaced. However, the McDonald’s brand can only be leveraged thanks to these ordinary resources.The authors also observe that the emergence of new business models that leverage a vast array ofordinary resources — particularly multisided platform business models — raises questions about therelevance of the traditional strategic focus on scarcity-based approaches and unique resources. Forexample, Airbnb connects an abundant number of people who want to source out their empty rooms tohirers who are looking for a space for a couple of nights. Airbnb’s user-friendly website, plain and simplebusiness model and 24/7 customer care service allow people to make use of their empty rooms in their house, a resource once considered to be relatively useless or trivial. The authors conclude thatin some cases, the mobilization of massive amounts of ordinary resources through platform businessmodels can outweigh the value of a few unique strategic assets. “Crowd jewels,” they conclude, can bea valuable substitute for “crown jewels.”","tags":["Business","Economics","Next Economy"]},{"id":"9781604911879","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Leadership in Action: Getting an Education - Schools Leaders Need Specialized Development","authors":["Karen M Dyer","Michael T.

But capitalism’s future is far from assured. The global financial meltdown of 2008 nearly produced a great depression. Economies in Europe are still teetering. Income inequality, resource depletion, mass migrations from poor to rich countries, religious fundamentalismthese are just a few of the threats to continuing prosperity. How can capitalism be sustained? And who should spearhead the effort? Critics turn to government. In Capitalism at Risk, Harvard Business School professors Joseph Bower, Herman Leonard, and Lynn Paine argue that while governments must play a role, businesses should take the lead. For enterprising companieswhether large multinationals, established regional players, or small start-upsthe current threats to market capitalism present important opportunities.Capitalism at Risk draws on discussions with business leaders around the world to identify ten potential disruptors of the global market system. Presenting examples of companies already making a difference, the authors explain how business must serve both as innovator and activistdeveloping corporate strategies that effect change at the community, national, and international levels.Filled with rich insights, Capitalism at Risk presents a compelling and constructive vision for the future of market capitalism.","tags":["Business","Economics"]},{"id":"9783110434033","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Understanding Dollarization","authors":["Emre Ozsoz","Erick W.

The most common type of this financial phenomenon is partial (de facto) dollarization where foreign currencies are used side by side with local currency for saving and borrowing purposes in addition to serving as medium of exchange.\n\nGovernments in these countries have been encouraging dollarization for years by allowing their citizens to save and borrow from local banks in foreign currency. Yet the existence of multiple currencies on banks' balance sheets on both the asset and liability side poses risks to the health and stability of the banking system.\n\nThis book evaluates the practical aspects of partial dollarization in countries such as Turkey, South Korea, Peru, and Cambodia among others. Starting with the origins of the phenomenon, the impact on banking systems and financial depth of the credit markets are discussed along with risks to the banking systems. Challenges faced by Central Banks and banking regulators are evaluated using recent country studies.","tags":["Business","Economics"]},{"id":"9780131359468","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The College Solution: A Guide for Everyone Looking for the Right School at the Right Price","authors":["Lynn O’Shaughnessy"],"pages":"304","publication_date":"June 2008","description":"“The College Solution helps readers look beyond over-hyped admission rankings to discover schools that offer a quality education at affordable prices.

Within just one generation, China has transformed itself from an economically impoverished and politically unstable country to the second-largest economy in the world. But China faces monumental challenges, both economic and political, in the years ahead, notes author Yasheng Huang. As he explains, one thing we know about economic growth is that it typically slows down after a period of robust performance. It is much more difficult for a country to grow at a sustainably fast pace when the per capita GDP is high than when per capita GDP is low. Despite more than three decades of reforms, Huang argues, China is still substantially statist in its basic orientation. The result is that for each percentage point of GDP growth, China requires more and more energy and investments, with very worrisome implications for its environment and the health status of its population. China has grown by relying heavily on investments and exports and on its huge, low-cost labor force, not on technology and innovations. But there is increasing evidence that China is seeing diminishing returns with this growth model. Research shows that fast growth at an extremely low income level is relatively easy, although not every low-income country is able to grow. What is harder, says Huang, is being able to grow after the country has attained what is known as “middle-income status” (between $6,000 and $8,000 dollars per capita, a level that China has attained or is very close to attaining). Can China avoid the middle-income trap and grow at a sustained rate for another decade or more? Huang believes it can, but only if the country undertakes significant reforms, especially political reforms. As he points out, the factors that drive a country to grow when its per capita GDP is $700 are totally different from the growth drivers when a country has a per capita GDP near $7,000. At $700, China could simply copy and transplant the technology and production methods of other countries; it didn’t need to come up with its own innovations and technologies. Huang argues that China needs to transition to a stronger, market-based economic system, a political system that is more open and democratic, and a legal system that is rule-based and offers strong IP protection. There should be more freedom to think and to challenge authority, and limitations on the reach and power of government. In other words, China needs political reforms as well as economic reforms to enter the next stage of its growth model.","tags":["Business","Digital Economy","E-Commerce"]},{"id":"9781259587559","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Practical Electronics for Inventors, Fourth Edition, 4th Edition","authors":["Paul Scherz","Simon Monk"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"April 2016","description":"A Fully-Updated, No-Nonsense Guide to Electronics\n\nAdvance your electronics knowledge and gain the skills necessary to develop and construct your own functioning gadgets.

Pearson"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"April 2017","description":"It is impossible to block negative emotions from the workplace. Whether provoked by bad decisions, misfortune, or employees’ personal problems, no organization is immune from trouble, and trouble agitates bad feelings. In many organizations, negative emotions are brushed aside or are altogether taboo. However, discounting or brushing aside negative emotions can be costly to organizations — leading to lost productivity and employee disengagement. For more than two decades, the author has studied workplace circumstances that evoke negative emotions, from exceptional organizational crises to everyday incivility. One fundamental finding is that few executives handle employees’ negative feelings well. Many managers report that they do not know how to deal with negative emotions in the workplace. To address this condition, the author details how to improve competence and confidence in responding to negative emotions. She recommends specific actions to prepare for and step up to negative emotions at work — including anger, fear, and sadness, in particular. Promptly stepping up to negative emotions, the author points out, can stem interpersonal turbulence and keep satisfaction, engagement, and productivity intact. What’s more, when negative emotions are acknowledged openly, the author argues, employees can learn to anticipate and interpret their colleagues’ reactions to difficult circumstances more astutely. They grow to understand their own reactions better, too. With these improvements, appropriate responses to challenging situations can be made earlier, when adjustments are generally easier, more effective, and less expensive.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Communication","Emotional Intelligence"]},{"id":"9780137028450","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Understanding Digital Signal Processing, 3rd Edition","authors":["Richard G.

Everything we do in the digital world is protected by cryptography. But when pure math and algorithms are implemented in code, vulnerabilities emerge and can be exploited by hackers and bad actors. Hacking Cryptography details dozens of practical cryptographic implementations and then breaks down the flaws that adversaries use to exploit them. In Hacking Cryptography you’ll find unique guidance for understanding how cryptography has failed time and again, including:\nDUAL_EC_DRBG random number generation using backdoored constants\nExploiting the RC4 stream cipher, as used in WEP\nBlock ciphers for padding oracle attacks and manipulation of initialization-vectors\nExploiting hash functions by using length extension and rainbow table attacks\nImplementing RSA key generation vulnerable to short private exponents and exploiting it using the Weiner attack\nExploiting PKCS1.5 padding by using Bleichenbacher's signature-forgery attack\nIn Hacking Cryptography you’ll learn the common attack principles used against cryptographic security, and how to spot the implementation errors that make cryptography unsecure. Throughout, you’ll explore historical examples where popular cryptography has failed, such as the root key compromise for Sony PlayStation 3, and see what impact those failures have had on modern cryptography.About the TechnologyEven the strongest cryptographic systems in code and hardware leave cracks and vulnerabilities a would-be attacker can exploit. In this book, you’ll learn to write cryptographically secure code, sidestep common pitfalls, and assess new bugs and vulnerabilities as they are discovered.About the BookHacking Cryptography helps you secure your systems by revealing the “lockpicks” bad actors use to break cryptographic security.

It is intended for first-year graduate students who have some familiarity with probability and random variables, though not necessarily of random processes and systems that operate on random signals. It is also appropriate for advanced undergraduate students who have a strong mathematical background.\n\nThe book has the following features:\n\nSeveral appendices include related material on integration, important inequalities and identities, frequency-domain transforms, and linear algebra. These topics have been included so that the book is relatively self-contained. One appendix contains an extensive summary of 33 random variables and their properties such as moments, characteristic functions, and entropy.\n\nUnlike most books on probability, numerous figures have been included to clarify and expand upon important points. Over 600 illustrations and MATLAB plots have been designed to reinforce the material and illustrate the various characterizations and properties of random quantities.\n\nSufficient statistics are covered in detail, as is their connection to parameter estimation techniques. These include classical Bayesian estimation and several optimality criteria: mean-square error, mean-absolute error, maximum likelihood, method of moments, and least squares.\n\nThe last four chapters provide an introduction to several topics usually studied in subsequent engineering courses: communication systems and information theory; optimal filtering (Wiener and Kalman); adaptive filtering (FIR and IIR); and antenna beamforming, channel equalization, and direction finding. This material is available electronically at the companion website.\n\nProbability, Random Variables, and Random Processes is the only textbook on probability for engineers that includes relevant background material, provides extensive summaries of key results, and extends various statistical techniques to a range of applications in signal processing.\n\nNote: The ebook version does not provide access to the companion files.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Engineering","Electrical Engineering","Signal Processing"]},{"id":"9781597496124","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Practical Lock Picking","authors":["Deviant Ollam"],"pages":"256","publication_date":"September 2010","description":"Practical Lock Picking: A Physical Penetration Tester’s Training Guide introduces the reader to the basic principles of lock picking.

Digital monopolies like Google, Facebook and Amazon act as gatekeepers to the digital world. Amazon is capturing almost all online shopping dollars. We have the illusion of choice, but for most critical decisions, we have only one or two companies, when it comes to high speed Internet, health insurance, medical care, mortgage title insurance, social networks, Internet searches, or even consumer goods like toothpaste. Every day, the average American transfers a little of their pay check to monopolists and oligopolists. The solution is vigorous anti-trust enforcement to return America to a period where competition created higher economic growth, more jobs, higher wages and a level playing field for all. The Myth of Capitalism is the story of industrial concentration, but it matters to everyone, because the stakes could not be higher. It tackles the big questions of: why is the US becoming a more unequal society, why is economic growth anemic despite trillions of dollars of federal debt and money printing, why the number of start-ups has declined, and why are workers losing out.","tags":["Business","Economics"]},{"id":"9780471947837","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Computer Security and Cryptography","authors":["Alan G.

Building on his widely praised seminars, Brooks explains what current is, how it flows, and how it reacts. He begins by reviewing the nature of current, and then explains current flow in basic circuits, discusses sources that supply and drive current, and addresses the unique problems associated with current on PCBs. Brooks concludes by thoroughly illuminating signal integrity issues caused by current flow. He offers practical design solutions for each common type of problem, as well as for complex challenges involving very high frequency harmonics and very short wavelengths.\n\nCoverage includes\n\n• Current: its fundamental nature, basic definitions, and key concepts\n\n• Five fundamental laws of current, including Kirchoff’s law and Ohm’s law\n\n• Basic circuit concepts: resistive circuits, reactive circuits, and impedance\n\n• Voltage and current sources: Where electrons come from and why they move\n\n• Current-related PCB issues: temperature, transmission lines, reflections, coupled currents, power distribution, skin effect, dielectric losses, and vias\n\n• Solutions for signal integrity issues caused by current flow, from on-board inductance and apparent resistance changes to more complex problems\n\nThe text is written to be accessible and valuable for PCB designers at all levels of experience, whether they have engineering training or not.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Engineering","Electrical Engineering","Printed Circuit Board (PCB)"]},{"id":"9780123865335","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Switching Power Supplies A - Z, 2nd Edition","authors":["Sanjaya Maniktala"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"May 2012","description":"Switching Power Supplies A - Z is the most comprehensive study available of the theoretical and practical aspects of controlling and measuring Electromagnetic Interference in switching power supplies, including input filter instability considerations.\n\nThe new edition is thoroughly revised with six completely new chapters, while the existing EMI chapters are expanded to include many more step-by-step numerical examples and key derivations and EMI mitigation techniques.

But, particularly today, doing intelligence is mostly about teamwork—the volume, complexity, and global nature of the work demand collaboration across a diversity of people, disciplines, and organizations.And yet teams in the intelligence community face formidable challenges. Needed information may be classified, and ultimate goals are sometimes covert—concealed from the very people working to achieve them. The bureaucracy is immense and complex, and the extraordinary demands of the work lead to high turnover and frequent transfers. But there is also good news. J. Richard Hackman draws on his unparalleled decade of experience as a researcher on and consultant to the intelligence community to show how to create an environment where teamwork flourishes. Hackman identifies six conditions necessary for any team to succeed: setting up a well-defined, stable, interdependent unit; getting the right people on the team; defining a compelling purpose; establishing clear norms of conduct; creating a supportive organizational context; and providing team-focused coaching. He uses concrete examples to show how each of these conditions helps teams accomplish their missions.Although written with intelligence, defense, crisis management, and law enforcement professionals in mind, the book contains lessons that can be applied to any organization—these necessary conditions are universal.

By using the PropEr framework in both Erlang and Elixir, this book teaches you how to automatically generate test cases, test stateful programs, and change how you design your software for more principled and reliable approaches. You will be able to better explore the problem space, validate the assumptions you make when coming up with program behavior, and expose unexpected weaknesses in your design. PropEr will even show you how to reproduce the bugs it found. With this book, you will be writing efficient property-based tests in no time.\n\nMost tests only demonstrate that the code behaves how the developer expected it to behave, and therefore carry the same blind spots as their authors when special conditions or edge cases show up. Learn how to see things differently with property tests written in PropEr.\n\nStart with the basics of property tests, such as writing stateless properties, and using the default generators to generate test cases automatically. More importantly, learn how to think in properties. Improve your properties, write custom data generators, and discover what your code can or cannot do. Learn when to use property tests and when to stick with example tests with real-world sample projects. Explore various testing approaches to find the one that's best for your code. Shrink failing test cases to their simpler expression to highlight exactly what breaks in your code, and generate highly relevant data through targeted properties. Uncover the trickiest bugs you can think of with nearly no code at all with two special types of properties based on state transitions and finite state machines.\n\nWrite Erlang and Elixir properties that generate the most effective tests you'll see, whether they are unit tests or complex integration and system tests.\n\nWhat You Need\n\nBasic knowledge of Erlang, optionally Elixir\nFor Erlang tests: Erlang/OTP >= 20.0, with Rebar >= 3.4.0\nFor Elixir tests: Erlang/OTP >= 20.0, Elixir >= 1.5.0","tags":["Software Development","Programming Languages","Elixir"]},{"id":"9781617294044","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Elm in Action","authors":["Richard Feldman"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"April 2020","description":"Elm is more than just a cutting-edge programming language, it’s a chance to upgrade the way you think about building web applications.

Hall effect sensors, based on a magnetic phenomena, are one of the most commonly used sensing technologies today. In the 1970s it became possible to build Hall effect sensors on integrated circuits with onboard signal processing circuitry, vastly reducing the cost and enabling widespread practical use. One of the first major applications was in computer keyboards, replacing mechanical contacts. Hundreds of millions of these devices are now manufactured each year for use in a great variety of applications, including automobiles, computers, industrial control systems, cell phones, and many others. The importance of these sensors, however, contrasts with the limited information available. Many recent advances in miniaturization, smart sensor configurations, and networkable sensor technology have led to design changes and a need for reliable information. Most of the technical information on Hall effect sensors is supplied by sensor manufacturers and is slanted toward a particular product line. System design and control engineers need an independent, readable source of practical design information and technical details that is not product- or manufacturer-specific and that shows how Hall effect sensors work, how to interface to them, and how to apply them in a variety of uses.

It's like a shiny new car--no longer content to just admire Eclipse, you're now itching to get in and drive. Eclipse is to Java developers what Visual Studio is to .NET developers--it's an integrated development environment (IDE) that combines a code editor, compiler, debugger, text editor, graphical user interface (GUI) builder, and other components into a single, user-friendly application. It provides a solid foundation that enables Java developers to construct and run integrated software-development tools for web development, application design, modeling, performance, testing, and much more. As with any extensive programming tool, however, there's a lot to learn. And there s no better guy than well-known Java expert Steve Holzner to teach you. An award-winning and best-selling author who has been writing about Java topics since the language first appeared, Holzner delivers just the kind of targeted, practical, everyday knowledge you need to hone your mastery of Eclipse. Perfect as a companion to an Eclipse programming tutorial (such as Holzner's own Eclipse, O'Reilly, April 2004) or an ideal stand-alone for all those developers who either don't want or don't need the tutorial approach, the Eclipse Cookbook contains task-oriented recipes for more than 800 situations you may encounter while using this new Java platform--from deploying a web application automatically to reverse engineering compiled code, from re-naming all references to a class across multiple packages to initializing the SWT JNI libraries. Each recipe in the ever-popular and utterly practical problem-solution-discussion format for O'Reilly cookbooks contains a clear and thorough description of the problem, a brief but complete discussion of a solution, and in-action examples illustrating that solution. The Eclipse Cookbook will satiate Java programmers at all levels who are ready to go beyond tutorials--far beyond writing plug-ins and extensions--and actually use the powerful and convenient Eclipse day to day.","tags":["Software Development","Text Editors & IDEs","Eclipse IDE"]},{"id":"9781118498484","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Low Voltage Electron Microscopy: Principles and Applications","authors":["David C.

There is no shortage of good encryption software, and no shortage of books, articles and essays that purport to be about how to use it. Yet there is precious little for ordinary users who want just enough information about encryption to use it safely and securely and appropriately--WITHOUT having to become experts in cryptography.\n\nData encryption is a powerful tool, if used properly. Encryption turns ordinary, readable data into what looks like gibberish, but gibberish that only the end user can turn back into readable data again.

This book calls them Cacti and Snowflakes—each singularly transcendent. But can people with such fundamentally different ways of making sense of and engaging with the world work together?Yes, says Devora Zack! The key is not to try to change each other. Zack says we can directly control only three things: what we say, what we think, and what we do. The best use of our energy is to focus on our own reactions and perceptions rather than try to “fix” other people. This book includes an assessment so readers can learn where they are on the Thinker/Feeler spectrum—and because it's a spectrum, readers might well be a snowcactus or a cactusflake.

He challenges us to understand how we know what we think we know in order to better discover faulty assumptions that often are camouflaged by language. His knowledge building loop offers guideposts to design experiments and organize feedback to facilitate early adaptation to a changed environment and to avoid being mired in ways of thinking rooted in 'knowledge' of what worked well in the past—a context far different from the context of today. His book explains a way of being that enables those who work for, or invest in, business firms to see beyond accounting silos and short-term quarterly earnings and to focus on capabilities instrumental for creating long-term future and sustainable value for the firm's stakeholders. I can't recommend this astounding book enough especially given its deep and timely insights for our world today.\" —John Seely Brown, former Chief Scientist for Xerox Corp and Director of its Palo Alto Research Center (PARC); co-author with Ann Pendleton-Jullian of Design Unbound: Designing for Emergence in a White Water World\n\n\"In contrast to existing abstract theories of the firm, Madden's pragmatic theory of the firm connects management's decisions in a practical way to a firm's life cycle and market valuation. The book promotes a firm's knowledge building proficiency, relative to competitors, as the fundamental driver of a firm's long-term performance, which leads to insights about organizational capabilities, intangible assets, and excess shareholder returns. Value Creation Principles is ideally suited to facilitate progress in the New Economy by opening up the process by which firms build knowledge and create value, which is a needed step in revising how neoclassical economics treats the firm.\" —Tyler Cowen, Professor of Economics, George Mason University; co-author of the popular economics blog Marginal Revolution\n\n\"Bartley Madden rightfully points out that both textbook and more advanced economic theories of the firm fail to address the concerns of top management and boards of directors.

Candy"],"pages":"472","publication_date":"April 2009","description":"New Bayesian approach helps you solve tough problems in signal processing with ease\n\nSignal processing is based on this fundamental concept—the extraction of critical information from noisy, uncertain data. Most techniques rely on underlying Gaussian assumptions for a solution, but what happens when these assumptions are erroneous? Bayesian techniques circumvent this limitation by offering a completely different approach that can easily incorporate non-Gaussian and nonlinear processes along with all of the usual methods currently available.\n\nThis text enables readers to fully exploit the many advantages of the \"Bayesian approach\" to model-based signal processing. It clearly demonstrates the features of this powerful approach compared to the pure statistical methods found in other texts. Readers will discover how easily and effectively the Bayesian approach, coupled with the hierarchy of physics-based models developed throughout, can be applied to signal processing problems that previously seemed unsolvable.\n\nBayesian Signal Processing features the latest generation of processors (particle filters) that have been enabled by the advent of high-speed/high-throughput computers. The Bayesian approach is uniformly developed in this book's algorithms, examples, applications, and case studies. Throughout this book, the emphasis is on nonlinear/non-Gaussian problems; however, some classical techniques (e.g. Kalman filters, unscented Kalman filters, Gaussian sums, grid-based filters, et al) are included to enable readers familiar with those methods to draw parallels between the two approaches.\n\nSpecial features include:\n\nUnified Bayesian treatment starting from the basics (Bayes's rule) to the more advanced (Monte Carlo sampling), evolving to the next-generation techniques (sequential Monte Carlo sampling)\n\nIncorporates \"classical\" Kalman filtering for linear, linearized, and nonlinear systems; \"modern\" unscented Kalman filters; and the \"next-generation\" Bayesian particle filters\n\nExamples illustrate how theory can be applied directly to a variety of processing problems\n\nCase studies demonstrate how the Bayesian approach solves real-world problems in practice\n\nMATLAB notes at the end of each chapter help readers solve complex problems using readily available software commands and point out software packages available\n\nProblem sets test readers' knowledge and help them put their new skills into practice\n\nThe basic Bayesian approach is emphasized throughout this text in order to enable the processor to rethink the approach to formulating and solving signal processing problems from the Bayesian perspective. This text brings readers from the classical methods of model-based signal processing to the next generation of processors that will clearly dominate the future of signal processing for years to come. With its many illustrations demonstrating the applicability of the Bayesian approach to real-world problems in signal processing, this text is essential for all students, scientists, and engineers who investigate and apply signal processing to their everyday problems.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Engineering","Electrical Engineering","Signal Processing"]},{"id":"9781466506916","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Power Electronics and Control Techniques for Maximum Energy Harvesting in Photovoltaic Systems","authors":["Nicola Femia","Giovanni Petrone","Giovanni Spagnuolo"],"pages":"366","publication_date":"July 2017","description":"This reference examines control circuits, systems, and techniques for maximizing the electrical power produced by a photovoltaic (PV) source under any weather conditions.

The company hired more than 70,000 new employees and opened new stores around the world—all while maintaining its reputation as one of the world’s best corporate citizens.\n\nIn The IKEA Edge, Dahlvig tells the story of how IKEA matured from an entrepreneurial startup to a leader in the furniture industry. He recounts his 26-year career at the company and what he learned along the way. In his rise from store manager to president, Dahlvig developed the unique vision he relied upon to lead IKEA through good times and bad—by combining traditional business goals like profit and growth with the progressive interests of social responsibility and environmental stewardship. Dahlvig proves that these objectives, which are usually viewed as polar opposites, can actually work wonders together.\n\nThe IKEA Edge serves as an expansive case study for “doing good business while being a good business.” Dahlvig clearly lays out the cornerstones that support IKEA: a vision of social responsibility; market leadership with a balanced global portfolio; differentiation through control of the value chain; and building for the long term—four principles that can be applied in any business, in any industry. social and business agenda—and it continues to grow, even during the worst global recession in history. In a time when the public’s trust of business has hit bottom, such an approach to business is more critical than ever.\n\nA combination of personal memoir, call to action, and strategic vision, The IKEA Edge provides the inspiration and information you need to develop a social-good/good-business agenda for your own company. Public trust, brand recognition, customer loyalty, and a world-class reputation will soon follow.","tags":["Business","Economics","Next Economy"]},{"id":"9781845697846","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Electricity Transmission, Distribution and Storage Systems","authors":["Z Melhem"],"pages":"512","publication_date":"October 2013","description":"Electricity transmission and distribution systems carry electricity from suppliers to demand sites.

Author Tom Mahon provides an insider's perspective on the birth of the semiconductor industry, which sparked the region's transformation from sleepy farmland to the heart and soul of the high-tech revolution. Through twenty-five extended, in-person interviews you'll meet a diverse cast of characters whose goal was to create technology and tools in service to humanity. In the Afterword to this edition, the author questions whether they accomplished their objectives and urges readers to rise up and rethink technology.\n\nWhat did it take to create the atmosphere that transformed rich farmland into the wealthy center of high-tech? Five climates lined up in just the right way. Educational institutions (Stanford and Berkeley); an attractive location with balmy, Mediterranean-like weather; a history of technology development (Federal Telegraph in the early twentieth century); financial risk taking (the gold rush); and a cultural climate near the center of an ideological revolution (the hippie movement). The Santa Clara Valley had them all. In spades.\n\nBefore personal computers, or the Internet, or social media came *chips*. Inventive minds took advantage of the quad-electron structure and unique properties - insulative and conductive - of silicon to create semiconductors. But Charged Bodies is more than just the story of new technologies emerging from \"The Valley of the Heart's Delight.\" Using an approach like The Canterbury Tales, Tom Mahon captures the spirit of Silicon Valley in the 80s through the stories of the people all around him. The inventors and bankers have their say. But so do a range of other people who lived through that transition. Listen as artists and hackers, detectives and journalists, lawyers and scientists, flappers and philosophers tell the story of Silicon Valley in their own words.","tags":["Business","Economics","Next Economy"]},{"id":"9781788472678","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Mastering Elixir","authors":["André Albuquerque","Daniel Caixinha"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"July 2018","description":"Mastering Elixir is your guide to becoming an expert in building, deploying, and scaling concurrent and fault-tolerant applications using the Elixir programming language.

Until now, researchers and policymakers have had to dig to find out what we know and what we still have to learn about performance assessment. Beyond the Bubble Test: How Performance Assessments Support 21st Century Learning synthesizes the latest findings in the field, and not a moment too soon.\n\nStatistics indicate that the United States is in danger of falling behind if it fails to adapt to our changing world. The memory and recall strategies of traditional testing are no longer adequate to equip our students with the skills they need to excel in the global economy. Instead teachers need to engage students in deeper learning, assessing their ability to use higher-order skills.\n\nSkills like synthesizing information, understanding evidence, and critical problem-solving are not achieved when we teach to multiple-choice exams. Examples in Beyond the Bubble Test paint a useful picture of how schools can begin to supplement traditional tests with something that works better. This book provides new perspectives on current performance assessment research, plus an incisive look at what's possible at the local and state levels.\n\nLinda Darling-Hammond, with a team of leading scholars, bring together lessons learned, new directions, and solid recommendations into a single, readily accessible compendium. Beyond the Bubble Test situates the current debate on performance assessment within the context of testing in the United States. This comprehensive resource also looks beyond our U.S. borders to Singapore, Hong Kong, and other places whose reform-mindedness can serve as an example to us.","tags":["Other","Education"]},{"id":"9781950496136","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Designing Microlearning","authors":["Sue Iannone","Carla Torgerson"],"pages":"240","publication_date":"December 2019","description":"Learn to Create Effective Microlearning\n\nMicrolearning is an essential tool that talent development professionals can use to fully engage their learners and tackle organizational performance needs.

Van Fleet"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"January 2008","description":"An \"applications first\" approach to discrete wavelet transformations\n\nDiscrete Wavelet Transformations provides readers with a broad elementary introduction to discrete wavelet transformations and their applications. With extensive graphical displays, this self-contained book integrates concepts from calculus and linear algebra into the construction of wavelet transformations and their various applications, including data compression, edge detection in images, and signal and image denoising.\n\nThe book begins with a cursory look at wavelet transformation development and illustrates its allure in digital signal and image applications. Next, a chapter on digital image basics, quantitative and qualitative measures, and Huffman coding equips readers with the tools necessary to develop a comprehensive understanding of the applications. Subsequent chapters discuss the Fourier series, convolution, and filtering, as well as the Haar wavelet transform to introduce image compression and image edge detection. The development of Daubechies filtersis presented in addition to coverage of wavelet shrinkage in the area of image and signal denoising. The book concludes with the construction of biorthogonal filters and also describes their incorporation in the JPEG2000 image compression standard.\n\nThe author's \"applications first\" approach promotes a hands-on treatment of wavelet transforma-tion construction, and over 400 exercises are presented in a multi-part format that guide readers through the solution to each problem. Over sixty computer labs and software development projects provide opportunities for readers to write modules and experiment with the ideas discussed throughout the text. The author's software package, DiscreteWavelets, is used to perform various imaging and audio tasks, compute wavelet transformations and inverses, and visualize the output of the computations. Supplementary material is also available via the book's related Web site, which includes an audio and video repository, final project modules, and softwarefor reproducing examples from the book. All software, including the DiscreteWavelets package, is available for use with Mathematica®, MATLAB®, and Maple.\n\nDiscrete Wavelet Transformations strongly reinforces the use of mathematics in digital data applications, sharpens programming skills, and provides a foundation for further study of more advanced topics, such as real analysis. This book is ideal for courses on discrete wavelet transforms and their applications at the undergraduate level and also serves as an excellent reference for mathematicians, engineers, and scientists who wish to learn about discrete wavelet transforms at an elementary level.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Engineering","Electrical Engineering","Signal Processing"]},{"id":"9781449334758","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"LED Lighting","authors":["Sal Cangeloso"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"July 2012","description":"We’re on the brink of a lighting revolution with light-emitting diodes—the tiny LEDs you’ve seen in electronic devices for years.

According to the 2007 Socha-Gelbmann Electronic Discovery Survey, it is now a $2 billion industry, a 60% increase from 2004, projected to double by 2009. The core reason for the explosion of e-discovery is sheer volume; evidence is digital and 75% of modern day lawsuits entail e-discovery.A recent survey reports that U.S. companies face an average of 305 pending lawsuits internationally. For large U.S. companies ($1 billion or more in revenue)that number has soared to 556 on average, with an average of 50 new disputes emerging each year for nearly half of them. To properly manage the role of digital information in an investigative or legal setting, an enterprise--whether it is a Fortune 500 company, a small accounting firm or a vast government agency--must develop an effective electronic discovery program. Since the amendments to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which took effect in December 2006, it is even more vital that the lifecycle of electronically stored information be understood and properly managed to avoid risks and costly mistakes. This books holds the keys to success for systems administrators, information security and other IT department personnel who are charged with aiding the e-discovery process.\nComprehensive resource for corporate technologists, records managers, consultants, and legal team members to the e-discovery process, with information unavailable anywhere else\nOffers a detailed understanding of key industry trends, especially the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, that are driving the adoption of e-discovery programs\nIncludes vital project management metrics to help monitor workflow, gauge costs and speed the process","tags":["Data","Electronic Discovery"]},{"id":"9781484255254","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"C Programming for the PIC Microcontroller: Demystify Coding with Embedded Programming","authors":["Hubert Henry Ward"],"pages":"282","publication_date":"December 2019","description":"Go beyond the jigsaw approach of just using blocks of code you don’t understand and become a programmer who really understands how your code works. \nStarting with the fundamentals on C programming, this book walks you through where the C language fits with microcontrollers.

Chapters on diachronic developments (language change), comparisons with other (non-)European languages, and on interfaces with neighboring fields of interest are also included.\n\nThe editors and authors hope that readers, regardless of their familiarity with Romance languages, will gain new insights into deixis in general, and into the similarities and differences among deictic structures used in the languages of the world.","tags":["Software Development","Programming Languages","Elixir"]},{"id":"9781523006335","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"We Can't Talk about That at Work!

The results of this pioneering study reveal how education leaders can make data work for students and teachers, rather than against them.\n\nThis book is an essential guide to meeting the challenges of high-stakes accountability, building performance-based schools, and improving student outcomes. By following the advice in this book, you'll be able to transform data overload into a data-positive school culture. You'll learn the difference between \"data-driven leadership\" and \"data-informed leadership,\" and how to use distributed leadership to inspire collaboration and guided analysis.\n\nIncorporating narrative reflections drawn from real educators and administrators, the authors refine their observations and interviews into practical conclusions that leaders can put to use immediately. This book empowers leaders to support inquiry, build trust in data-based initiatives, establish goals for evidence use, and provide educators with the skills they need to mobilize data for the good of all stakeholders.\n\n\"Datnow and Park's ideas are easily accessible and grounded in clear examples, and their seven 'calls' about what needs to be done nail the problem and the solutions.

The growing risks stemming from higher debt, slower growth, and limited room for policy maneuver raise concerns about the ability and propensity of modern economies to find effective solutions to chronic problems. It is important to understand the structural roots of inherent imbalance, persistence-in-error patterns, policy and governance failures, as well as moral and ethical failures.\n\n　　　　 Admittedly, finance and economics have their own failures, with abstract theory bearing little relation with the real economy, uncertainties and vicissitudes of economic life. Economic research has certainly become more empirical despite, or perhaps because of, the lack of guidance from theory. The analytics of Islamic economics and finance may not differ from standard frameworks, methods, and techniques used in conventional economics, but may offer new perspectives on the making of financial crises, nature of credit cycles, roots of financial system instability, and determinants of income disparities.\n\n　　　 The focus is placed on the logical coherence of Islamic economics and finance, properties of Islamic capital markets, workings of Islamic banking, pricing of Islamic financial instruments, and limits of debt financing, fiscal stimulus and conventional monetary policies, inter alia. Readers with investment, regulatory, and academic interests will find the body of analytical evidence to span many areas of economic inquiry, refuting thereby the false argument that given its religious tenets, Islamic economics is intrinsically narrative, descriptive and not amenable to testable implications.

Education is perfectly placed to create the conditions for innovative and imaginative solutions and to provide the formulas that ensure that everyone becomes naturally smart; but to achieve this, we need to recognise that an education that is not grounded in a full understanding of our relationship with the natural world is no education at all. In other words, a total transformation of schools and schooling is needed.\n\nWhile acknowledging that the ecological crisis is global in scale, Paul Clarke maintains that many of the solutions are already evident in our local communities. Drawing on innovative sustainable living programmes from around the world, including Sweden’s Forest Schools, China’s Green Schools programme, the US Green Ribbon Schools programme and his own school-of-sustainability project, Paul Clarke offers practical solutions about how schools and communities can make their contribution.\n\nThis book examines how we might proceed to empower and actively develop schools and communities to connect hand, heart and mind for an eco-literate future. It is thought provoking, timely and challenging, and should be read by school leaders, community and business leaders, as well as anyone grappling with the problems of transition from an industrial past to an ecologically sustainable future.","tags":["Other","Education"]},{"id":"9780123965615","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Dielectric Phenomena in Solids","authors":["Kwan Chi Kao"],"pages":"579","publication_date":"March 2004","description":"In general, a dielectric is considered as a non-conducting or insulating material (such as a ceramic or polymer used to manufacture a microelectronic device).

Good design requires the integration of many different forms of knowledge, including physics, aesthetics, business acumen, engineering, and architecture. It also requires a systems approach that combines and assimilates different technologies and structures. Good design is accomplished when art meets science to achieve higher-performance and more-efficient and effective systems. Introduction to Photovoltaic System Design provides readers with the knowledge they need to design high-performance PV systems. The text takes a systematic approach to designing PV, with emphasis on custom-design approaches for every system. Readers will encounter the latest, real-world information regarding site evaluations, strings and wire sizing, designing to code, PV components, and monitoring and testing.\n\nAbout the Series:\n\nThe Photovoltaics (PV) industry stands on the brink of a revolution. The appeal of a new and growing industry has brought an influx of new PV professionals to the market, but the availability of educational resources has not kept pace with market demands.

When people inside a company develop a shared sense of what’s going on in the world, they see new opportunities faster than their competitors. They have the courage to take a risk on something new. And they have the gut-level certitude to stick with an idea that doesn’t take off right away. People are \"Wired to Care,\" and many of the world’s best organizations are, too.\n\nIn pursuit of this idea, Patnaik takes readers inside big companies like IBM, Target, and Intel to see widespread empathy in action. But he also goes to farmers' markets and a conference on world religions. He dives deep into the catacombs of the human brain to find the biological sources of empathy. And he spends time on both sides of the political aisle, with James Carville, the Ragin’ Cajun, and John McCain, a national hero, to show how empathy can give you the acuity to cut through a morass of contradictory information.\n\nWired to Care is a compelling tale of the power that people have to see the world through each other’s eyes, told with passion for the possibilities that lie ahead if leaders learn to stop worrying about their own problems and start caring about the world around them. As Patnaik notes, in addition to its considerable economic benefits, increasing empathy for the people you serve can have a personal impact, as well: It just might help you to have a better day at work.","tags":["Business","Economics","Next Economy"]},{"id":"9781439838266","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Methods for Estimation and Inference in Modern Econometrics","authors":["Stanislav Anatolyev","Nikolay Gospodinov"],"pages":"234","publication_date":"June 2011","description":"This book covers important topics in econometrics.

In contrast to traditional RF techniques, this innovative book sets forth digitally intensive design techniques that lead the way to the development of low-cost, low-power, and highly integrated circuits for RF functions in deep submicron CMOS processes. Furthermore, the authors demonstrate how the architecture enables readers to integrate an RF front-end with the digital back-end onto a single silicon die using standard ASIC design flow.\n\nTaking a bottom-up approach that progressively builds skills and knowledge, the book begins with an introduction to basic concepts of frequency synthesis and then guides the reader through an all-digital RF frequency synthesizer design:\n\nChapter 2 presents a digitally controlled oscillator (DCO), which is the foundation of a novel architecture, and introduces a time-domain model used for analysis and VHDL simulation\n\nChapter 3 adds a hierarchical layer of arithmetic abstraction to the DCO that makes it easier to operate algorithmically\n\nChapter 4 builds a phase correction mechanism around the DCO such that the system's frequency drift or wander performance matches that of the stable external frequency reference\n\nChapter 5 presents an application of the all-digital RF synthesizer\n\nChapter 6 describes the behavioral modeling and simulation methodology used in design\n\nThe final chapter presents the implementation of a full transmitter and experimental results. The novel ideas presented here have been implemented and proven in two high-volume, commercial single-chip radios developed at Texas Instruments: Bluetooth and GSM.\n\nWhile the focus of the book is on RF frequency synthesizer design, the techniques can be applied to the design of other digitally assisted analog circuits as well.

These systems, from hand-held devices to automotive sub-systems to aerospace vehicles, employ electronics to manage and adapt to a world that is, predominantly, neither digital nor electronic. To respond to this design challenge, the industry has developed and standardized VHDL-AMS, a unified design language for modeling digital, analog, mixed-signal, and mixed-technology systems. VHDL-AMS extends VHDL to bring the successful HDL modeling methodology of digital electronic systems design to these new design disciplines.Gregory Peterson and Darrell Teegarden join best-selling author Peter Ashenden in teaching designers how to use VHDL-AMS to model these complex systems. This comprehensive tutorial and reference provides detailed descriptions of both the syntax and semantics of the language and of successful modeling techniques.

Using graphs as the underlying glue, you can readily join data together and create navigation paths across diverse sets of data. Add Elixir, with its awesome power of concurrency, and you'll soon be mastering data networks. Learn how different graph models can be accessed and used from within Elixir and how you can build a robust semantics overlay on top of graph data structures. We'll start from the basics and examine the main graph paradigms. Get ready to embrace the world of connected data!\n\nGraphs provide an intuitive and highly flexible means for organizing and querying huge amounts of loosely coupled data items. These data networks, or graphs in math speak, are typically stored and queried using graph databases. Elixir, with its noted support for fault tolerance and concurrency, stands out as a language eminently suited to processing sparsely connected and distributed datasets.\n\nUsing Elixir and graph-aware packages in the Elixir ecosystem, you'll easily be able to fit your data to graphs and networks, and gain new information insights. Build a testbed app for comparing native graph data with external graph databases. Develop a set of applications under a single umbrella app to drill down into graph structures. Build graph models in Elixir, and query graph databases of various stripes - using Cypher and Gremlin with property graphs and SPARQL with RDF graphs. Transform data from one graph modeling regime to another. Understand why property graphs are especially good at graph traversal problems, while RDF graphs shine at integrating different semantic models and can scale up to web proportions.\n\nHarness the outstanding power of concurrent processing in Elixir to work with distributed graph datasets and manage data at scale.\n\nWhat You Need:\n\nTo follow along with the book, you should have Elixir 1.10+ installed. The book will guide you through setting up an umbrella application for a graph testbed using a variety of graph databases for which Java SDK 8+ is generally required.

Global financial institutions teetered and fell, while at once-mighty U.S. companies, panicked CEOs slashed jobs. The financial chaos inflicted catastrophic damage: double-digit unemployment; crashing house and stock prices; federal budget deficits in the trillions, and a wider gap between the country’s haves and have-nots. Today many Americans still feel shell-shocked. But while there remains much to be nervous and frustrated about, it is impressive how much progress has been made in righting the wrongs that got us into this mess. The economy is growing and steadily creating jobs; house prices are stable and stock prices are up; debt burdens have eased for most households and the financial system has shored up its foundations to an impressive degree. American companies are as competitive globally as they have been in a half century. This dramatic turn in the economy’s fortunes occurred because of what government did to stem the financial panic and combat the effects of Great Recession. Policymakers’ unprecedented actions – from Congress’ auto and bank bailouts and fiscal stimulus, to the Federal Reserve’s zero interest rates and quantitative easing – remain intensely controversial, but ultimately they will be judged a success. Serious problems remain, including the government’s mounting debt load and a burgeoning number of disenfranchised workers, but we are on our way to addressing them.

To understand the evolution of this ideology and economic system, Liberalism and Capitalism Today examines the work of the two authors who have contributed the most to the analysis of the conditions that lead to the emergence of these types of organization: Alexis de Tocqueville of France and Max Weber of Germany.This book thus analyzes how the evolution of the general environment of a civilization leads to the emergence of new ways of approaching economic life, and then to its development, thanks to innovations in many fields.This historical perspective makes it possible to understand the transformations that liberalism and capitalism could offer. It suggests a potential path that does not involve simply returning to a way of life that has been totally altered by the evolution of civilizations and the economy, but instead leads to a more peaceful way of living in most countries of the world.","tags":["Business","Economics"]},{"id":"9781482245325","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Acting Strategically Using Drama Theory","authors":["James William Bryant"],"pages":"365","publication_date":"October 2015","description":"This book uses drama theory-a radical extension of game theory-to show how best to communicate so as to manage the emotionally charged confrontations occurring in any worthwhile relationship.

The convergence of these emerging workplace trends has created a generation of hyperconnected workers who are placing increased pressure on employers to overhaul their approach to talent management. In The 2020 Workplace, human resources experts Jeanne C. Meister and Karie Willyerd offer a practical game plan companies can use to attract and keep these employees, and, in doing so, transform their organizations; achieve compelling business results, such as increased innovation and improved customer connectedness; and compete more effectively in the global marketplace.\n\nBased on key findings from two surveys of global professionals, as well as case studies from organizations such as Deloitte, Cisco, Bell Canada, JetBlue, Nokia, and NASA, this book shows how the social technologies that are used outside the company in marketing to connect with customers can be adapted for use inside the company to connect with employees. Meister and Willyerd bolster their thought-provoking research with real-world examples of these practices in action, including a YouTube new-hire orientation contest, the use of Twitter for sourcing job candidates, and a video game for new hires. With twenty predictions for the 2020 workplace and a glossary for those who have never texted, posted to Facebook, or Tweeted, this book is a must-read guide to what companies should do—and are already doing—to create tomorrow's workplace of choice.","tags":["Business","Economics","Next Economy"]},{"id":"9780874259483","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Guaranteeing Performance Improvement: A Purely Practical Positive Approach","authors":["Richard F.

However, the emergence of platforms and technologies that can be rented as needed have eroded the relationship between fixed costs and output that defined economies of scale. Together, these new factors have enabled small companies to pursue niche markets and successfully challenge large established companies that are weighed down by investments in mass production, distribution, and marketing. \"Investments in scale used to make a lot of sense,\" argues author Hemant Taneja. They supported the development of cars, airplanes, radio, and television, and built out the electric grid and telephone system. But with the emergence of mobile, social, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence in recent years, Taneja argues that business logic has shifted toward what he describes as \"the economics of unscale,\" which allows for mass customization for increasingly narrow markets. Because companies can stay nimble and focused by easily and instantly renting scale, they can adjust quickly to changing demand and conditions with little cost and relatively little effort. According to Taneja, large corporations are taking note. Traditionally, Procter & Gamble Co. invented most of its new products in-house. But in recent years it has started to tap into ideas from outside inventors who submit ideas via the internet. Other large companies, including General Electric Co. and Walmart Stores Inc., are tapping into new, unscaled businesses as well. Taneja presents three recommendations to large companies seeking to remain relevant. His first recommendation is to become a platform. Operating a platform can be enormously profitable because the companies that operate on the platforms come to depend on them for their success. The author’s second recommendation is to instill a product focus. Big companies, he argues, get sidetracked on issues that have little to do with making great products. But in an unscaled era, this can create openings for focused small competitors. His third recommendation is to find growth opportunities through what he calls \"dynamic rebundling.\" The winners in the unscaled economy, he writes, \"make every customer feel like a market of one.\" Products and services that are tailored to individuals will often have an advantage over mass-market products and services, Taneja says. Corporations, therefore, can try to maintain their advantage with collections of products from their portfolios that they bundle for particular customers.","tags":["Business","Economics","Next Economy"]},{"id":"9781119086413","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Modeling and Optimization of Parallel and Distributed Embedded Systems","authors":["Arslan Munir","Ann Gordon-Ross","Sanjay Ranka"],"pages":"400","publication_date":"February 2016","description":"This book introduces the state-of-the-art in research in parallel and distributed embedded systems, which have been enabled by developments in silicon technology, micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS), wireless communications, computer networking, and digital electronics.

While it is today generally believed that the transition from 'hard' and inflexible commodity money (such as a gold standard) to entirely flexible and potentially unlimited fiat money under national central banks allows for superior economic stability, Paper Money Collapse shows that the opposite is true. Systems of highly elastic and constantly expanding money are not only unnecessary, even for growing economies, they are always extremely destabilizing. Over time, they must lead to substantial imbalances, including excessive levels of debt and distorted asset prices, that will require ever faster money production to sustain. Ultimately, however, there is no alternative to a complete liquidation of these distortions. Based on insights of many renowned economists and in particular of the Austrian School of Economics, the book explains through rigorous logic and in precise language why our system of flexible fiat money is incompatible with a market economy and therefore unsustainable. Paper money systems have always led to economic disintegration—without exception—throughout history. It will not be different for our system and we may be closer to the endgame than many think.\n\nThe updated second edition incorporates:\n\nA new introduction and an extended outlook section that discusses various \"endgames\"\n\nResponses to criticisms, alternative views, and a critical assessment of 'solutions'\n\nComments on recent policy trends, including attempts to exit the 'easy money' policy mode\n\nAn evaluation of new crypto-currency Bitcoin\n\nPaper Money Collapse: The Folly of Elastic Money, Second Edition clarifies the problem of paper money clearly and eloquently, and proposes multiple routes to a solution.","tags":["Business","Economics"]},{"id":"9781483135519","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Maplin Electronic Circuits Handbook, 2nd Edition","authors":["Michael Tooley"],"pages":"312","publication_date":"October 2013","description":"The Maplin Electronic Circuits Handbook, Second Edition provides information pertinent to the design, testing, and construction of electronic circuits.

Learning transforms people's lives, and teaching, in any forum, is the art and science of bringing out the brilliance that drives those transformations.”Or it should be. But what often happens is that people who teach—in classrooms, meetings, workshops, coaching sessions, or any other setting where learning happens—don't know how to transfer their great content to others effectively. They spend 70 percent of their time on what they are teaching and only 30 percent on how to teach it, when it should be the other way around. Halsey is here to reverse that equation, laying out a comprehensive instructional design model that deeply engages and energizes learners because it focuses not on how smart they are but on how they are smart. She shows how to create content that is clear, relevant, easily absorbed, and readily retained because it is tailored to each participant's specific needs, abilities, and inclinations. Halsey's six-step ENGAGE Model replaces the old “sit 'n' get” model with “woo 'n' do”—learners are actively drawn in and perform activities that reinforce the learning. She presents hundreds of proven ideas, strategies, and practices that will enable you to Energize learners at the beginning of any learning session; help them Navigate the new content and Generate personal meaning and relevance from it; Apply their learning to the real world; Gauge and celebrate their progress; and Extend their learning to action.

However, because of the introduction of computer engineering courses into already-crowded four-year undergraduate programs, the transmission line courses in many electrical engineering programs have been relegated to a senior technical elective, if offered at all.\n\nNow, Analysis of Multiconductor Transmission Lines, Second Edition has been significantly updated and reorganized to fill the need for a structured course on transmission lines in a senior undergraduate- or graduate-level electrical engineering program. In this new edition, each broad analysis topic, e.g., per-unit-length parameters, frequency-domain analysis, time-domain analysis, and incident field excitation, now has a chapter concerning two-conductor lines followed immediately by a chapter on MTLs for that topic. This enables instructors to emphasize two-conductor lines or MTLs or both.\n\nIn addition to the reorganization of the material, this Second Edition now contains important advancements in analysis methods that have developed since the previous edition, such as methods for achieving signal integrity (SI) in high-speed digital interconnects, the finite-difference, time-domain (FDTD) solution methods, and the time-domain to frequency-domain transformation (TDFD) method. Furthermore, the content of Chapters 8 and 9 on digital signal propagation and signal integrity application has been considerably expanded upon to reflect all of the vital information current and future designers of high-speed digital systems need to know.\n\nComplete with an accompanying FTP site, appendices with descriptions of numerous FORTRAN computer codes that implement all the techniques in the text, and a brief but thorough tutorial on the SPICE/PSPICE circuit analysis program, Analysis of Multiconductor Transmission Lines, Second Edition is an indispensable textbook for students and a valuable resource for industry professionals.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Engineering","Electrical Engineering","Signal Processing"]},{"id":"9789814411691","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Spintronics in Nanoscale Devices","authors":["Eric R.

These forces translate into strenuous design requirements for embedded engineers and programmers. Many low-level embedded microcontroller designs have insufficient memory and/or architectural limitations that make the use of a real-time operating system impractical. The techniques presented in this book allow the design of robust multitasking firmware through the use of interleaved state machines. This book presents a complete overview of multitasking terminology and basic concepts. Practical criteria for task selection and state machine design are also discussed.Designing multitasking firmware is arduous, complex and fraught with potential for errors, and there is no one, “standard way to do it.

This is done in a reader-friendly fashion, without complex mathematical arguments and proofs. Economic Growth and the High Wage Economy shows how high wage economies help make firms and economies more productive and why high wage economies can be competitive even in an increasingly globalized environment. It also demonstrates why concerns that labor supply will dry up as wages increase and social benefits rise are largely based on impoverished economic reasoning.\n\nThe first chapters provide a theoretical basis for the rest of the book, showing for instance how higher wages are prone to increasing the level of economic efficiency by getting people to work harder and smarter (mainly smarter). Altman also explains that our understanding of technological change can be markedly improved by modelling technological change as a product of higher wages and improved working conditions and other shocks to the economic system. As the book develops, it is shown that increasing and high levels of income inequality are not necessary for growth and development, because the economic ‘pie’ grows when the economic wellbeing of the lower half and even the middle improves. The evolution of the state can also be better understood by applying this analytical framework. So too can the persistence of inefficient systems of production and cultural traits that appear to be inconsistent with economic prosperity. On top of this, the book examines the implications of Altman’s theoretical framework for macroeconomic analysis and policy. Finally, it is shown that labor supply can be better understood by introducing target income into the analytical mix.\n\nThe main contribution of this book is providing the theoretical underpinning for why relatively high wages and, moreover, competition with high wages is good for dynamic growth and development. This work establishes why an alternative model of labor supply, based on the notion and reality of target income, does a better job of explaining the evolution of labor supply. The latter also reinforces the view that increasing wage and workers’ benefits should not be expected to damage the economy, even in the realm of labor supply. This book will be of interest to public policy experts, trade unions, human rights experts and scholars of behavioural economics, labour economics and globalization.","tags":["Business","Economics"]},{"id":"9781484224601","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Magento 2 DIY","authors":["Viktor Khliupko"],"pages":"198","publication_date":"December 2016","description":"Learn how Magento 2, the newest version of the eCommerce platform, works.

Market booms and busts, tulip manias and dotcom bubbles, venture capitalists and vulture funds, he lets you know, are best explained not by dry statistics and obscure theories but by the metaphors and analogies of literature.\n\nNow, in Mobs, Messiahs, and Markets, Bonner and freelance journalist Lila Rajiva use literary economics to offer broader insights into mass behavior and its devastating effects on society. Why is it, they ask, that perfectly sane and responsible individuals can get together, and by some bizarre alchemy turn into an irrational mob? What makes them trust charlatans and demagogues who manipulate their worst instincts? Why do they abandon good sense, good behavior and good taste when an empty slogan is waved in front of them. Why is the road to hell paved with so many sterling intentions? Why is there a  fool on every corner and a knave in every public office?\n\nIn attempting an answer, the authors weave a light-hearted journey through history, politics and finance to show group think at work in an improbable array of instances, from medieval crusades to the architectural follies of hedge-fund managers. Their journey takes them ultimately to the desk of the chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank and to a cautionary tale of the current bubble economy. They warn that the gush of credit let loose by Alan Greenspan and multiplied by the sophisticated number games of Wall Street whizzes is fraught with perils for the unwary.

Two things are required: first, to replace the mind-as-container metaphor with one that envisions a mind capable of sustaining knowledgeable, intelligent behavior without actually containing stored beliefs; second, to recognize a fundamental difference between knowledge building and learning--both of which are essential parts of education for the knowledge age. Connectionism in cognitive science addresses the first need; certain developments in post-positivist epistemology address the second. The author explores both the theoretical bases and the practical educational implications of this radical change in viewpoint. The book draws on current new ways of thinking about knowledge and mind, including information processing, cognitive psychology, situated cognition, constructivism, social constructivism, and connectionism, but does not adhere strictly to any \"camp.\" Above all, the author is concerned with developing a way of thinking about the mind that can usher education into the knowledge age.

The multilevel inverters can be approximately compared to a sinusoidal waveform because of their increased number of direct current voltage levels, which provides an opportunity to eliminate harmonic contents and therefore allows the utilization of smaller and more reliable components. On the other side, multilevel inverters require more components than traditional inverters and that increases the overall cost of the system. The various algorithms for multilevel neutral point clamped inverter fed induction motor are proposed and implemented, and the results are analyzed. The performance of these algorithms is evaluated in terms of inverter output voltage, current waveforms and total harmonic distortion.

Suitable for researchers in computer graphics, computer vision, visualization, medical imaging, and geometric modeling as well as graduate and senior undergraduate students in computer science, Diffusion-Driven Wavelet Design for Shape Analysis presents recent research results in wavelet designs on 3D shapes and their applications in shape analysis. It explains how to apply the design methods to various types of 3D data, such as polygonal meshes, point clouds, manifolds, and volumetric images.\n\nExtensions of Wavelet Generation on Volumetric and Manifold DataThe first part of the book introduces design methods of wavelets on manifold data, incorporating interdisciplinary knowledge from differential geometry, functional analysis, Fourier transform, spectral graph theory, and stochastic processes. The authors show how wavelets are purely determined by the shape geometry and how wavelet transforms are computed as inner products of wavelet kernels and input functions.\n\nWavelets for Solving Computer Graphics ProblemsThe second part presents applications in shape analysis/representation. The book looks at wavelets as spectral tools for geometry processing with filters in a joint space-frequency domain and examines wavelets as detail extractors for shape feature definition and detection. Going beyond these fundamental applications, the book also covers middle- and high-level applications, including shape matching, shape registration, and shape retrieval.\n\nEasy-to-Understand Implementations and AlgorithmsUnlike many other wavelet books, this one does not involve complicated mathematics. Instead, the book uses simplified formulations and illustrative examples to explain deep theories.

One of the major performance limitations in today's chip designs is clock skew, the uncertainty in arrival times between a pair of clocks. Increasing clock frequencies are forcing many engineers to rethink their timing budgets and to use skew-tolerant circuit techniques for both domino and static circuits. While senior designers have long developed their own techniques for reducing the sequencing overhead of domino circuits, this knowledge has routinely been protected as trade secret and has rarely been shared. Skew-Tolerant Circuit Design presents a systematic way of achieving the same goal and puts it in the hands of all designers.This book clearly presents skew-tolerant techniques and shows how they address the challenges of clocking, latching, and clock skew. It provides the practicing circuit designer with a clearly detailed tutorial and an insightful summary of the most recent literature on these critical clock skew issues.\n\nSynthesizes the most recent advances in skew-tolerant design in one cohesive tutorial\nProvides incisive instruction and advice punctuated by humorous illustrations\nIncludes exercises to test understanding of key concepts and solutions to selected exercises","tags":["Hardware","Embedded Systems","Microelectronics"]},{"id":"9781000529111","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Sociology and Management Education","authors":["Manish Thakur"],"pages":"126","publication_date":"October 2021","description":"While examining the intersections and engagements between sociology and management education in historical and contemporary terms, this volume outlines the agenda of a promising prospective engagement between the two.

This technology is just now being implemented into hardware and working its way into wireless standards such as the ubiquitous 802.11g, as well as third- and fourth-generation cellular standards.\n\nMultiple-Input Multiple-Output Channel Models uniquely brings together the theoretical and practical aspects of MIMO communications, revealing how these systems use their multipath diversity to increase channel capacity. It gives the reader a clear understanding of the underlying propagation mechanisms in the wideband MIMO channel, which is fundamental to the development of communication algorithms, signaling strategies, and transceiver design for MIMO systems.\n\nMIMO channel models are important tools in understanding the potential gains of a MIMO system. This book discusses two types of wideband MIMO models in detail: correlative channel models—specifically the Kronecker, Weichselberger, and structured models—and cluster models, including Saleh-Valenzuela, European Cooperation in the field of Scientific and Technical Research (COST) 273, and Random Cluster models. From simple to complex, the reader will understand the models' mechanisms and the reasons behind the parameters. Next, channel sounding is explained in detail, presenting the theory behind a few channel sounding techniques used to sound narrowband and wideband channels. The technique of digital matched filtering is then examined and, using real-life data, is shown to provide very accurate estimates of channel gains. The book concludes with a performance analysis of the structured and Kronecker models.\n\nMultiple-Input Multiple-Output Channel Models is the first book to apply tensor calculus to the problem of wideband MIMO channel modeling. Each chapter features a list of important references, including core literary references, Matlab implementations of key models, and the location of databases that can be used to help in the development of new models or communication algorithms.

Communism is dead, but in the wake of Enron and similar scandals, many see capitalism as amoral and too easily abused. A blueprint for progress is needed and Moral Capitalism provides one.Moral Capitalism is based on principles developed by the Caux Round Table, an extraordinary international network of top business executives who believe that business can-and must-weigh both profit and principle. Caux Round Table's global chair, Stephen Young, argues that the ethical standards inherent in capitalism have been compromised by cultural values inimical to capitalism's essentially egalitarian, rational spirit, and distorted by the short-sighted dog-eat-dog doctrines of social Darwinism into what he calls brute capitalism. He demonstrates how the Caux Round Table's Seven General Principles for Business can serve as a blueprint for a new moral capitalism, and explores in detail how, if guided by these principles, capitalism is really the only system with the potential to reduce global poverty and tyranny and address the needs and aspirations of individuals, societies, and nations.","tags":["Business","Economics"]},{"id":"9781118944868","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Design Economics for the Built Environment: Impact of Sustainability on Project Evaluation","authors":["Ben Ilozor","Barry Gilbertson","Barry Symonds"],"pages":"432","publication_date":"May 2015","description":"The drive towards environmentally friendly buildings and infrastructure has led to a growing interest in providing design solutions underpinned by the core principles of sustainability to balance economic, social and environmental factors.\n\nDesign Economics for the Built Environment: Impact of sustainability on project evaluation presents new directions, reflecting the need to recognise the impact of climate change and the importance of sustainability in project evaluation.

Koo"],"pages":"320","publication_date":"October 2014","description":"Compare global experiences during the balance sheet recession and find out what is needed for a full recovery\n\nThe Escape from Balance Sheet Recession and the QE Trap details the many hidden dangers remaining as the world slowly recovers from the balance sheet recession of 2008. Author and leading economist Richard Koo explains the unique political and economic pitfalls that stand in the way of recovery from this rare type of recession that was largely overlooked by economists. Koo anticipated the current predicament in the West long before others and issued warnings in his previous books: Balance Sheet Recession and The Holy Grail of Macroeconomics. This new book illustrates how history is repeating itself in Europe while the United States, which learnt from the Japanese experience, is doing better by avoiding the fiscal cliff. However, because of the liberal dosage of quantitative easing already implemented, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Japan may face a treacherous path to normalcy in what Koo calls the QE Trap. He argues that it is necessary to understand balance sheet recession in order to resolve the Eurozone crisis, particularly the competitiveness problems. Koo issues warnings against those who are too ready to argue for structural reforms when the problems are actually with balance sheets. He re-examines Japan's two decades of experiences with this rare recession and offers an insider view on the Abenomics. On China, readers will gain a very different historical perspective as Koo argues that western commentators have forgotten their own history when they talk about the re-balancing of the Chinese economy.\n\nLearn from Japan which experienced the same predicament afflicting the West fifteen years earlier\n\nDiscover how unwinding of quantitative easing will affect the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, as well as the emerging world\n\nExamine solutions to the Eurozone problems caused by two balance sheet recessions eight years apart\n\nGain insight into China's problems from the West's own experiences with urbanisation\n\nKoo, who developed the concept of balance sheet recession based on Japan's experience, took the revolution in macroeconomics started by John Maynard Keynes in 1936 to a new height. The Escape from Balance Sheet Recession and the QE Trap offers the world cure for balance sheet recession.","tags":["Business","Economics"]},{"id":"0596008457","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"sendmail 8.13 Companion","authors":["Bryan Costales","George Jansen","Claus Assmann"],"pages":"192","publication_date":"September 2004","description":"If you had a list of the words used to describe sendmail, they'd probably include reliable, flexible, configurable, complex, monolithic, and daunting. But you're not likely to find the word easy. Even seasoned sendmail pros are sometimes frustrated by the intricacies of sendmail's configuration files. With a little determination and the help of a good reference book, like sendmail, Third Edition, you can master this demanding program. But when there's a significant point release, like sendmail V8.13, where do you turn? An excellent companion to our popular sendmail, Third Edition, the sendmail 8.13 Companion provides a timely way to document the improvements in V8.13 in parallel with its release. The book highlights the important changes in the latest update to sendmail, pointing out not just what is handy or nice to have, but what's critical in getting the best behavior from sendmail. This is especially important now that spam is on the rise, and because mobile technology requires roving laptops to use encrypted connections. Not surprisingly, many of the changes and additions to V8.13 have been driven by the ongoing fight against spam. Anyone concerned about spam--and who isn't?--will benefit greatly by upgrading to V8.13 sendmail. Among its many enhancements, V8.13 includes new routines that support the SPF sending site authentication standard (in the Milter library), simultaneous connection control, high connection rate control, and finer tuning of SASL parameters. The additions to the Milter library, alone, make upgrading worthwhile, but sendmail's connection control makes it a no-brainer. The key to understanding them is the sendmail 8.13 Companion. The book is divided into twenty-five chapters that parallel the chapters in the third edition of the sendmail book. For instance, if you're interested in Options configuration (Chapter 24 in sendmail), you'll turn to Chapter 24 in your companion volume to find out what's new in V8.13. For a simple dot release (8.12 to 8.13), V8.13 sendmail has added more features, options, and fundamental changes than any other single dot release has included. If you need to set up or manage sendmail, you'll want this companion volume close at hand. Even if you aren't ready to upgrade to V8.13, you'll find the key to understanding them is the sendmail 8.13 Companion a useful guide to understanding and staying current with the latest changes in sendmail.","tags":["IT Operations","Service Administration","Email Servers","Sendmail"]},{"id":"53863MIT64225","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Rethinking Executive Incentives Can Boost ESG Performance","authors":["Martin Skladany"],"pages":"6","publication_date":"October 2022","description":"Economic crises tend to have a disproportionate negative impact on employees rather than high-paid executives, whose incomes often increase even at the worst of times.

After I die, I hope God will explain turbulence to me.\" Einstein might have been more confused today: Turbulence, in all its manifestations, is on the rise. Financial markets gyrate. Commodity prices zig and zag. New technologies disrupt long-standing businesses and entire industries. Scientific discoveries overturn historical truisms. Dirty bombs and pension busts, natural disasters and flu pandemics, add to the tumult. We live in a world beset by turbulence.\n\nWe often respond to turbulence by accelerating activities that worked in the past. We lapse into inertia when we should adapt with agility, and we cling to rigid dogmas when we should improvise. But throughout history, volatility has not only dethroned incumbent leaders, it has also created untold possibilities to create economic value. Turbulence has an upside, and companies that seize the opportunities arising out of seething markets will become tomorrow's champions.\n\nBased on more than a decade of research, The Upside of Turbulence draws lessons from companies that have consistently spotted and exploited opportunities that rivals have missed. The book explores realms ranging from improvisational comedy to the U.S. Marine Corp's combat doctrine. The result is a series of provocative insights that defy conventional wisdom.

The utility sector, after decades of relative stability, is in the midst of such a transformation today.\n\nAfter providing a historical summary of the dominant business models of the utility sector, Transformation of the Electric Utility Business Model looks at the factors currently impacting the industry. Utilities and policy makers today are facing two long-term issues that will dominate their agendas in the coming decades: rebuilding utility infrastructure to enable the decarbonization of the economy, and managing the risk of catastrophic events that can leave large areas without power for extended periods. Fortunately, with proper planning, many utility investments in decarbonization will also support risk management. However, these investments are often not compatible with current utility business models, requiring creativity and new regulatory frameworks to successfully implement. This book considers the impact of these factors, and then discusses the future.\n\nThis well-researched, extremely insightful book is essential reading for all those with an interest in business strategy, energy studies and sustainability.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Engineering","Electrical Engineering"]},{"id":"9781785880766","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Magento 2 Beginners Guide","authors":["Gabriel Guarino"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"March 2017","description":"This book, \"Magento 2 Beginners Guide\", is your comprehensive starting point for mastering Magento 2, the leading e-commerce platform.

For advanced (ultra)-wideband wireless systems, the necessity and design methodology of wideband filters will be discussed with reference to the inherent limitation in fractional bandwidth of classical bandpass filters. Besides the detailed working principles, a large number of design examples are demonstrated, which can be easily followed and modified by the readers to achieve their own desired specifications. Therefore, this book is of interest not only to students and researchers from academia, but also to design engineers in industry. With the help of complete design procedures and tabulated design parameters, even those with little filter design experience, will find this book to be a useful design guideline and reference, which can free them from tedious computer-aided full-wave electromagnetic simulations. Among different design proposals, wideband bandpass filters based on the multi-mode resonator have demonstrated many unparalleled attractive features, including a simple design methodology, compact size, low loss and good linearity in the wide passband, enhanced out-of-band rejection, and easy integration with other circuits/antennas. A conventional bandpass filter works under single dominant resonant modes of a few cascaded transmission line resonators and its operating bandwidth is widened via enhanced coupling between the adjacent resonators. However, this traditional approach needs an extremely high coupling degree of coupled-lines while producing a narrow upper stopband between the dominant and harmonic bands. As a sequence, the desired dominant passband is restricted to an extent less than 60% in fractional bandwidth. To circumvent these issues and break with the tradition, a filter based on the multiple resonant modes was initially introduced in 2000 by the first author of this book. Based on this novel concept, a new class of wideband filters with fractional bandwidths larger than 60% has been successfully developed so far. This book, presents and characterizes a variety of multi-mode resonators with stepped-impedance or loaded-stub configurations using the matured transmission line theory for development of advanced microwave wideband filters.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Engineering","Electrical Engineering","Signal Processing"]},{"id":"9780132479974","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Truth About Finding Great Academic Fits in Your College Search","authors":["Lynn O’Shaughnessy"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"August 2010","description":"This Element is an excerpt from The College Solution: A Guide for Everyone Looking for the Right School at the Right Price (9780132365703) by Lynn O’Shaughnessy.

So it is not surprising that these smaller markets face unique challenges during recovery. The Economic Viability of Micropolitan America addresses the economic history and future of small cities and towns across the country, as they have and will continue to see dramatic shifts in the roles they play in the extant larger economies.\n\nThe book discusses the 300-year history of America’s economic structures in substantial detail and with an eye on the development and growth of, and the changes to, the economic geography of the United States. It explores the fate of the small cities and towns in America, examining how they emerged over time and their economic fate in the future. The author explores what constitutes a small city or town, who lives there, and how they support their families and their communities. He also explores what roles these communities can play in the larger economic picture. Is it possible that small cities and towns can offer enough in the way of assets and amenities to become economic hubs in the future? And if so, will that evolution create such growth that it will override and eliminate the very qualities from which they derived their initial appeal?\n\nWith nearly seventy case studies and interviews, the book examines the role of business within the future context of community settings. It distills lessons learned into a list of the most prominent and potentially effective tactics for other small cities and towns to emulate as they, too, seek to develop their local economic bases and ensure that their communities can survive and thrive in the twenty-first century.","tags":["Business","Economics"]},{"id":"9781633699649","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Peter F.

However, these new applications bring with them a new set of challenges. With coverage ranging from the basics to new and emerging applications, Compact Plasma and Focused Ion Beams discusses how compact high-density microwave plasmas with dimensions smaller than the geometrical cutoff dimension can be generated and utilized for providing focused ion beams of various elements.\n\nStarting with the fundamentals of the cutoff problem for wave propagation in waveguides and plasma diagnostics, the author goes on to explain in detail the plasma production by microwaves in a compact geometry and narrow tubes. He then thoroughly discusses wave interaction with bounded plasmas and provides a deeper understanding of the physics. The book concludes with an up-to-date account of recent research on pulsed microwaves and the application of compact microwave plasmas for multi-element FIB.\n\nIt provides a consolidated and unified description of the emerging areas in plasma science and technology utilizing wave-based plasma sources based on the author’s own work and experience. The book will be useful not only to established researchers in this area but will also serve as an excellent introduction to those interested in applying these ideas to various current and new applications.","tags":["Hardware","Embedded Systems","Microelectronics"]},{"id":"9781098174255","language":"en","level":null,"title":"Become Involved with Communities","authors":["Charles Humble"],"pages":"5","publication_date":"October 2024","description":"This selection of shortcuts will enable you to improve your communication, critical thinking, documentation, and networking skills.

But with his focus on \"the market\" as the best mechanism for producing and distributing the necessities of life, Smith's concepts only told part of the story, leading to flawed economic models that devalue activities that fall outside of the market's parameters of buying and selling. The real wealth of nations, Riane Eisler argues, is not merely financial, but includes the contributions of people and our natural environment. Here, Eisler goes beyond the market to reexamine economics from a larger perspective--and shows that we must give visibility and value to the socially and economically essential work of caring for people and the planet if we are to meet the enormous challenges we are facing.Eisler proposes a new \"caring economics\" that takes into account the full spectrum of economic activities--from the life--sustaining activities of the household, to the life-enriching activities of caregivers and communities, to the life-supporting processes of nature. She shows how our values are distorted by the economic double standard that devalues anything stereotypically associated with women and femininity; reveals how current economic models are based on a deep-seated culture of domination; and shows how human needs would be better served by economic models based on caring. Most importantly, she provides practical proposals for new economic inventions--new measures, policies, rules, and practices--to bring about a caring economics that fulfills human needs.Like her classic The Chalice and the Blade, The Real Wealth of Nations is a bold and insightful look at how to create a society in which each of us can achieve the full measure of our humanity.","tags":["Business","Economics"]},{"id":"01120100005SI","language":"en","level":null,"title":"Masked Dispatches: Cryptograms and Cryptology in American History, 1775-1900","authors":["Ralph E.

The growth is being fed by two forces: (1) traditional retailers are getting their “Internet acts” together, and (2) “pure play” retailers are becoming increasingly innovative.\n\nThe authors studied two groups: online retailers selling popular-brand consumables for the home, such as laundry detergent, pet supplies and diapers (represented by Netgrocer.com and Diapers.com); and online retailers selling specialty items, including fashion eyeglasses and apparel for men (represented by WarbyParker.com and Bonobos.com). They came up with a set of findings that may have important implications not just for pure-play Internet retailers but for more traditional retailers, too. Among them:\n\nIndividual consumer acceptance depends on offline shopping costs. For Internet retailers, the best market opportunities are with customers in locations where offline retail shopping is limited and costs (including sales tax) are high.\n\nSales evolution is structured and predictable. Although initial online sales in a particular region, and some geographic variation in sales across regions, may be driven by offline product costs, growth is fueled by the sharing of information among friends and neighbors. The authors’ research on Netgrocer.com, an online retailer that delivers groceries, found that ZIP codes with lots of new customers tended to be adjacent to areas that had high concentrations of customers in earlier periods.\n\nMigrating from “good” to “great” requires expansion to niche locations. Although sales emerge first in areas where customers face high offline shopping costs and are propagated through local customer interactions, in order for online retailers to extend their reach they need to tap into hundreds or thousands of markets that individually represent few sales but collectively add up to significant numbers.\n\nDifferent locations require different customer acquisition strategies. In ZIP codes with a high physical density of customers, offline word of mouth can be particularly powerful. Traditional print advertising tended to work well in less dense environments.","tags":["Business","Digital Economy","E-Commerce"]},{"id":"53863MIT62114","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Why Our Knowledge Economy Can Survive the New Age of Pestilence","authors":["Joel Mokyr"],"pages":"5","publication_date":"August 2020","description":"Modernization has changed the way economies are exposed to, respond to, and are affected by disasters.

Recognizing how challenging this is, economics instruction has adopted video, simulation, and other methods to aid in learning. These methods, however, while possibly stimulating students' imagination, may also stifle it and contribute to a dependent learning style. It may also fail to connect topics and models in cohesive and meaningful ways. This book presents macroeconomic principles in a logical and concise order, and uses the Maple© mathematics program to build and analyze macroeconomic models. The method outlined in this book teaches readers with basic algebraic skill levels how to build a model of the macro-economy from the ground up. The method uses models derived from typical principles textbooks using Maple as a platform. Maple's interface is as easy to use as typing a simple math problem in Microsoft Word using keys on a standard keyboard. The Maple syntax is kept simple, which allows readers to be proficient in Maple in a matter of minutes. In short, this book allows executives, advanced degree students, undergraduate students, business executives, managers, policy makers, and others to gain a fuller understanding of how the macro-economy works.

It turns out that business is a mosaic of interesting puzzles like managing risk, developing and reversing strategies, and looking into the future by deconstructing the past.\n\nAs a founder of NetApp, a data storage firm that began as an idea scribbled on a placemat and now takes in $4 billion a year, Hitz has seen his company go through every major cycle in business—from the Jack-of-All-Trades mentality of a start-up, through the tumultuous period of the IPO and the dot-com bust, and finally to a mature enterprise company. NetApp is one of the fastest-growing computer companies ever, and for six years in a row it has been on Fortune magazine’s list of Best Companies to Work For. Not bad for a high school dropout who began his business career selling his blood for money and typing the names of diseases onto index cards.\n\nWith colorful examples and anecdotes, How to Castrate a Bull is a story for everyone interested in understanding business, the reasons why companies succeed and fail, and how powerful lessons often come from strange and unexpected places.\n\nDave Hitz co-founded NetApp in 1992 with James Lau and Michael Malcolm. He served as a programmer, marketing evangelist, technical architect, and vice president of engineering. Presently, he is responsible for future strategy and direction for the company.

This will require workers to acquire new sources of bargaining power and for business, labor, government, and educators to work together to meet the challenges and opportunities facing the next generation workforce. The book reviews what worked well for average workers, families, and the economy during the era of the post-World War II Social Contract, why that contract broke down, and how, working together, we can build a new social contract suitable to today's economy and workforce.

Kochan"],"pages":"5","publication_date":"October 2015","description":"Business leaders have a choice in how they want to compete. “High-road” companies, author Thomas A. Kochan argues, are managed for the long term, seeking to compete through a combination of high productivity, innovation, and quality customer service that both requires and supports high wages and good job and career opportunities for employees. “Low-road” companies, by contrast, seek profits and shareholder returns by minimizing costs and controlling labor in ways that keep wages low for most employees and/or contractors.\n\nA prototypical high-road company the author cites is Southwest Airlines Co., which has been the most profitable airline in the U.S. over the past 30 years and has also often been rated as one of the best places in the U.S. to work. Also mentioned is Market Basket, a family-owned grocery store chain headquartered in Tewksbury, Massachusetts. In the summer of 2014, Market Basket’s legacy of low prices, good customer service, and good-quality jobs was highlighted when a family feud broke out among members of its board of directors and the family member who had been serving as CEO and was popular among employees was fired. After a six-week “strike” by nonunion employees and managers that had broad community and media support (it caused an astounding 92% reduction in the company’s revenues), the board agreed to sell the business to the ousted CEO, whose reinstatement employees had sought.\n\nStandard economics argues that the higher labor costs are as a proportion of total costs, the more important it is to control these costs. However, the author explains, high-road companies take another view, relying heavily on practices including screening employees for their strong technical, problem-solving, and collaborative skills; investment in training and development of the full workforce; compensation systems that align employee and company interests through profit sharing and/or payment for attaining higher levels of skills; and labor–management partnerships.\n\nDespite the effectiveness of high-road practices and their attractiveness to young employees, they are not widely followed by managers. “Few MBAs learn about high-road strategies in their economics, finance, and operations courses,” the author writes. “They don’t learn that, as business leaders, they will have distinct choices to make about how to compete.” He argues that academics, business and labor leaders, and employees themselves need to educate current and next-generation business leaders about the choices before them.","tags":["Business","Economics","Next Economy"]},{"id":"53863MIT55417","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Protecting Intellectual Property in China","authors":["Mary Teagarden","Andreas Schotter"],"pages":"8","publication_date":"July 2014","description":"Intellectual property protection is the No. 1 challenge for multinational corporations operating in China. According to the U.S. government, China accounted for nearly 80% of all IP thefts from U.S.- headquartered organizations in 2013, causing an estimated $300 billion in lost business. For European manufacturers, the loss of IP in China reduced potential profits by 20%. The effects from IP leakage are visible in counterfeited items including toys, luxury goods and automotive and aircraft parts. But IP violations go beyond products. They extend to pirated operational processes and entire business and service models. For many multinational corporations, IP leakage becomes a barrier to integrating Chinese sites and partners into global innovation activities. IP leakage frequently occurs through staff transfers or shared practices from foreign multinational corporations to local joint ventures or supply chain partners. For multinationals, this type of IP leakage is often a calculated risk worth taking. However, unintended IP leakage can affect a company’s reputation and profitability. Even worse, it can create powerful local or even global competitors. To learn about how companies are managing the China IP protection challenge, authors Andreas Schotter and Mary Teagarden studied more than 50 multinational corporations. They identified nine IP protection practices that companies can use in China. Four of the practices are defensive and externally focused; the other five are proactive and internal. Together, these practices, which operate on the strategy, legal and business intelligence layers, create what the authors call the “IP protection web,” which allows corporations to (1) expand faster within China and across other emerging markets; (2) improve performance; and (3) enhance local and global innovativeness. According the authors, most of the companies they studied learned to protect their IP through trial and error — there is no single “best” process or practice. However, the changing composition of IP risk creates a need for ongoing reconfiguration. Indeed, as Chinese companies become more skillful at absorbing leaked IP from those employees who formerly worked for international rivals, international companies must develop more sophisticated responses and develop new ways to engender loyalty.","tags":["Business","Digital Economy","E-Commerce"]},{"id":"9781118619551","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Model Driven Engineering for Distributed Real-Time Embedded Systems 2009: Advances, Standards, Applications and Perspectives","authors":["Jean-Philippe Babau","Mireille Blay-Fornarino","Jöel Champeau"],"pages":"320","publication_date":"September 2010","description":"Model-based development methods, and supporting technologies, can provide the techniques and tools needed to address the dilemma between reducing system development costs and time, and developing increasingly complex systems.

Gans"],"pages":"8","publication_date":"April 2016","description":"Many business leaders are terrified by the word “disruption.” Over the past 20 years, Harvard Business School professor Clayton M. Christensen’s theory of disruptive innovation has led to widespread fear and paranoia among executives. For many, disruption is just around the corner, and the fear is palpable.\n\nSeveral academics have challenged the accuracy of Christensen’s theory — specifically, the extent to which disruptive innovations actually cause businesses in their path to fail. Author Joshua S. Gans concedes that disruption is a possibility, but he contends that the link between disruption and failure may not be as strong as many managers believe. In particular, Gans argues that disruption can be averted. “Many businesses find ways of managing through it, and this can weaken any relationship between a disruptive event and the actual disruption,” he writes.\n\nThe question, Gans says, is whether companies facing disruption are able to counter its effects. He describes three approaches to dealing with market entrants: beating them; joining them; and waiting them out.\n\nBeating Them: The first approach involves investing aggressively in new innovations after entrants bring them to market. Although Gans says managers may not know right away whether an entrant’s innovation will become a threat, when the situation becomes clear, they must act to protect their market position. He uses the example of Microsoft Corp., which introduced its Internet Explorer in the mid-1990s to compete against Netscape Navigator, which at the time was the dominant product in the browser market. Microsoft created a new division dedicated to defusing the Netscape threat.\n\nJoining Them: The idea here is for established businesses to “wait and see” whether a market entrant’s innovation improves and becomes a competitive threat. Then, instead of waging war, the existing player can acquire the entrant’s business and its products, thereby averting disruption. When disruption is upon them, Gans explains, incumbents realize they will face stiffer competition in the future, so they have an incentive to neutralize the threat. But there are also advantages to disrupters in avoiding a long period of intense competition with an established incumbent.\n\nWaiting Them Out: Gans suggests that established players should assess what they have that entrants lack -- entrants rarely have every element of a value chain. Indeed, he notes, sometimes incumbents are in positions of leadership precisely because they have invested in elements that are difficult to replicate. For example, in the printing industry, Mergenthaler, which pioneered the Linotype machine in the 1880s, also developed more than 1,000 typefaces, which established a high barrier for new entrants even as printing technology evolved. Under some circumstances, Gans writes, “incumbents may be able to afford to wait disruption out and react on their own timeline.”","tags":["Business","Economics","Next Economy"]},{"id":"9789814613798","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Integrated Nanophotonic Resonators","authors":["Ya Sha Yi"],"pages":"310","publication_date":"September 2015","description":"The rapid advancement of integrated optoelectronics has been driven considerably by miniaturization.

Although economics is sometimes dismissed as a discourse of practical relevance to only a relatively small circle of academicians and policy analysts who call themselves economists, sound economic reasoning benefits any manager of a business, whether they are involved with production/operations, marketing, finance, or corporate strategy. Along with enhancing decision making, the field of economics provides a common language and framework for comprehending and communicating phenomena that occur within a business, as well as between a business and its environment. This text addresses the core of a subject commonly called managerial economics, which is the application of microeconomics to business decisions. Key relationships between price, quantity, cost, revenue, and profit for an individual firm are presented in form of simple conceptual models. The text includes key elements from the economics of consumer demand and the economics of production. The book discusses economic motivations for expanding a business and contributions from economics for improved organization of large firms. Market price quantity equilibrium, competitive behavior, and the role of market structure on market equilibrium and competition are addressed. Finally, the text considers market regulation in terms of the generic problems that create the need for regulation and possible remedies for those problems. Although the academic literature of managerial economics often employs abstract mathematics and large corporations create and use sophisticated mathematical models that apply economics, this book focuses on concepts, terminology, and principles, with minimal use of mathematics. The reader will gain a better understanding of why businesses and markets function as they do and how those institutions can function better.","tags":["Business","Economics"]},{"id":"9780470640043","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Dice Have No Memory: Big Bets and Bad Economics from Paris to the Pampas","authors":["William Bonner"],"pages":"352","publication_date":"April 2011","description":"Right now, Congress, the Fed, and the Treasury are all gambling with your future and your money.

It's as though we're undertaking a bizarre social experiment to see how much inequality a democratic society can tolerate. As a result “We are the 99%,” the rallying cry of the Occupy movement, has spread far beyond its ranks. But who are the 99 percent? Who are the 1 percent? How extensive and systematic is inequality throughout society? What are its true causes and consequences? How is inequality changing in our world? And what can be done about it? For many years Chuck Collins has been a leading voice and activist on these questions. In this book he marshals wide-ranging data from a variety of sources to paint a graphic picture of how disparities in wealth and power play out in America and the world. For the first time, this book reveals the concrete meaning of “the 99% and the 1%,” looking not just at individual households but at the business world, the media, and the earth as a whole. Collins identifies the shifts in social values, political power, and economic policy that have led to our current era of extreme inequality—particularly the way Wall Street has managed to rig the rules of the game in favor of the 1perecent—and surveys the havoc inequality has wreaked on virtually every aspect of society. But there is hope. Not only does he offer common-sense proposals for closing the inequality gap, but Collins provides a guide to many of the groups—including some made up of millionaires—that are working to bring about a society that works for everybody: for the 100 percent. This is a struggle that can be won.

Shows how our economic crisis was a failure, not of the free market, but of government.” —Charles Koch, Chairman and CEO, Koch Industries, Inc.\n\nDid Wall Street cause the mess we are in? Should Washington place stronger regulations on the entire financial industry? Can we lower unemployment rates by controlling the free market?\n\nThe answer is NO.\n\nNot only is free market capitalism good for the economy, says industry expert John Allison, it is our only hope for recovery. As the nation’s longest-serving CEO of a top-25 financial institution, Allison has had a unique inside view of the events leading up to the financial crisis. He has seen the direct effect of government incentives on the real estate market. He has seen how government regulations only make matters worse.\n\nAnd now, in this controversial wake-up call of a book, he has given us a solution. The national bestselling The Financial Crisis and the Free Market Cure reveals:\n\nWhy regulation is bad for the market—and for the world\nWhat we can do to promote a healthy free market\nHow we can help end unemployment in America\nThe truth about TARP and the bailouts\nHow Washington can help Wall Street build a better future for everyone\n\nWith shrewd insight, alarming insider details, and practical advice for today’s leaders, this electrifying analysis is nothing less than a call to arms for a nation on the brink. You’ll learn how government incentives helped blow up the real estate bubble to unsustainable proportions, how financial tools such as derivatives have been wrongly blamed for the crash, and how Congress fails to understand it should not try to control the market—and then completely mismanages it when it tries. In the end, you’ll understand why it’s so important to put “free” back in free market.\n\nIt’s time for America to accept the truth: the government can’t fix the economy because the government wrecked the economy. This book gives us the tools, the inspiration—and the cure.","tags":["Business","Economics"]},{"id":"076866862X","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Selling Collectibles on eBay®","authors":["Michael Miller"],"pages":"88","publication_date":"November 2006","description":"Of all the categories of products for sale on eBay, the collectibles category is both the largest and the most complex.

Invigoratingeconomic development may need more than just achieving mere growth in GDP numbers and other mainstream macroeconomic key performance indices. Social equity, environmental conservation, inclusive development, and equitable income distribution are concepts that are increasingly given more weight in the measurement of economic development. The onset of the pandemic of the current decade has further emphasized the importance of these considerations as well as the concept of sharing of risks and return.\n\nThis book analyses the past and current fiscal situation in Malaysia and identifies areas of improvements in the current tax system and public sector financing in generating the required revenue and financing government expenditure. The alternative fiscal framework proposed in this book covers a tax structure that features a simple and fairer tax system that is based on the ability to pay and public financing which is free of interest and provides opportunity for broader participation of the public.\n\nAs Malaysia has a comprehensive framework as well as firm regulatory and government support for Islamic finance, the fiscal reform builds on an important feature of risk sharing Islamic finance that brings the real and financial sectors of the economy close together. The fiscal policy reform recommended in this book seeks to address the public debt burden, expand fiscal space, increase financial inclusion, reduce income and wealth disparities, increase employment and income for the growing population and ultimately improve social solidarity especially for a pluralistic country such as Malaysia.","tags":["Business","Economics"]},{"id":"9781118590096","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Starting an Etsy Business For Dummies, 2nd Edition","authors":["Kate Gatski","Kate Shoup"],"pages":"384","publication_date":"August 2013","description":"The easy way to build an online craft business from scratch\n\nStarting an Etsy Business For Dummies offers expert advice for artists and entrepreneurs looking to build an online craft business from scratch.

The anti-globalization movement wants more trade protectionism and less immigration. The global credit crisis is putting pressure on governments to bail out irresponsible lenders and borrowers at taxpayers’ expense. Instead, Donlan convincingly and clearly explains why we would all prosper more by doing all we can to make markets freer.”\n\n—Ed Yardeni, President, Yardeni Research, Inc.\n\n“Thomas Donlan reminds us all that capitalism is not simply one choice among different and equally valid economic systems, but instead that hard work and the accumulation of wealth is the natural tendency of successful people and healthy societies around the world.”\n\n—Christopher Whalen, Managing Director, Institutional Risk Analytics\n\n“It has been several decades since Joseph Schumpeter observed that the philosophical defense of a free-market economy must never cease.

For yearseven decadesin response to intensifying global competition, companies decided to outsource their manufacturing operations in order to reduce costs. But we are now seeing the alarming long-term effect of those choices: in many cases, once manufacturing capabilities go away, so does much of the ability to innovate and compete. Manufacturing, it turns out, really matters in an innovation-driven economy.In Producing Prosperity, Harvard Business School professors Gary Pisano and Willy Shih show the disastrous consequences of years of poor sourcing decisions and underinvestment in manufacturing capabilities. They reveal how today’s undervalued manufacturing operations often hold the seeds of tomorrow’s innovative new products, arguing that companies must reinvest in new product and process development in the US industrial sector. Only by reviving this industrial commons” can the world’s largest economy build the expertise and manufacturing muscle to regain competitive advantage. America needs a manufacturing renaissancefor restoring itself, and for the global economy as a whole.This will require major changes. Pisano and Shih show how company-level choices are key to the sustained success of industries and economies, and they provide business leaders with a framework for understanding the links between manufacturing and innovation that will enable them to make better outsourcing decisions. They also detail how government must change its support of basic and applied scientific research, and promote collaboration between business and academia. For executives, policymakers, academics, and innovators alike, Producing Prosperity provides the clearest and most compelling account yet of how the American economy lost its competitive edgeand how to get it back.","tags":["Business","Economics"]},{"id":"9780128032176","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Active Power Line Conditioners","authors":["Patricio Salmeron Revuelta","Salvador Pérez Litrán","Jaime Prieto Thomas"],"pages":"436","publication_date":"July 2015","description":"Active Power Line Conditioners: Design, Simulation and Implementation for Improving Power Quality presents a rigorous theoretical and practical approach to active power line conditioners, one of the subjects of most interest in the field of power quality. Its broad approach offers a journey that will allow power engineering professionals, researchers, and graduate students to learn more about the latest landmarks on the different APLC configurations for load active compensation.\n\nBy introducing the issues and equipment needs that arise when correcting the lack of power quality in power grids, this book helps define power terms according to the IEEE Standard 1459. Detailed chapters discuss instantaneous reactive power theory and the theoretical framework that enabled the practical development of APLCs, in both its original and modified formulations, along with other proposals.\n\nDifferent APLCs configurations for load compensation are explored, including shunt APF, series APF, hybrid APF, and shunt combined with series APF, also known as UPQC. The book includes simulation examples carefully developed and ready for download from the book’s companion website, along with different case studies where real APLCs have been developed.\n\nFinally, the new paradigm brought by the emergence of distribution systems with dispersed generation, such as the use of small power units based on gas technology or renewable energy sources, is discussed in a chapter where mitigation technologies are addressed in a distributed environment.\n\nCombines the development of theories, control strategies, and the most widespread practical implementations of active power line conditioners, along with the most recent new approaches\nDetails updated and practical content on periodic disturbances mitigation technologies with special emphasis on distributed generation systems\nIncludes over 28 practical simulation examples in Matlab-Simulink which are available for download at the book’s companion website, with 4 reproducible case studies from real APLCs","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Engineering","Electrical Engineering"]},{"id":"9781483140582","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Electrical Applications 2","authors":["David W.

Bell","Santiago Gallino","Antoio Moreno"],"pages":"8","publication_date":"April 2018","description":"At a time when many traditional retailers are closing their physical stores, digitally native vertical brands such as Bonobos, which specializes in men's apparel, and Warby Parker, which specializes in eyeglasses, are aggressively expanding into offline locations. In this article, the authors explore two related trends: (1) the expansion of online-first retailers into offline stores that \"supercharge\" customer value and (2) the transformation of stores run by traditional, offline-first retailers from fulfillment-dominant centers into experience-dominant centers. As authors David R. Bell, Santiago Gallino, and Antonio Moreno note, as digitally native vertical brands have learned to build relationships with customers, traditional retailers have been reducing their store sizes and inventories and are attempting to improve and elevate the customer experience. \"Showroom experiences,\" they write, \"create better customers.\" When customers are exposed to the brand in a showroom, \"they are better able to resolve any uncertainty about the nondigital attributes of the retailer's product.\" Similarly, the authors say, \"showrooms create better retailers: When customers are physically present in the retail environment, observation of their behaviors can lead to meaningful insights.\"The authors developed their early insights into what customers value while working closely with Bonobos and Warby Parker. Through simulations, they saw that stores with smaller footprints and a higher level of service led to better results economically — improved margins, smoother logistics, and better control of inventory. They found that, rather than being dead, physical retail stores were very much alive with a profound shift in focus — from fulfillment to experience-oriented environments. The authors conclude that online-first retailers and traditional retailers have something to learn from each other. Offline-first retailers can benefit from copying the showroom concepts originated by online-first retailers; online-first retailers can benefit by opening more traditional stores.","tags":["Business","Digital Economy","E-Commerce"]},{"id":"9780750699938","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Green Electronics/Green Bottom Line","authors":["Lee H Goldberg"],"pages":"340","publication_date":"November 1999","description":"Environmentally safe engineering is one of the hottest and most controversial topics in technical circles.

In Crunch he responds to dozens of questions he has fielded from working Americans, questions that directly relate to the bottom-line, dollars-and-cents concerns of real people. Chances are if there's a stumper you've always wanted to ask an economist, it's solved in this book. Bernstein is fed up with “Darth Vaders with PhDs” who use their supposed expertise to intimidate average citizens and turn economics into a tool for the rich and powerful. In the pages of Crunch, Bernstein lays bare the dark secret of economics: it's not an objective scientific discipline. It's a set of decisions about the best way to organize our society to produce and distribute resources and opportunities. And we all can, and must, participate in these decisions. “America is a democracy,” he writes. “And in a democracy all of us, not just the elites and their scholarly shock troops, get to weigh in on biggies like this.” Our economy will be only as fair as we can make it.

How integrated should economies really be? How much regulation is right? Many people fuse these two dimensions of choice into one, either favoring both globalization and deregulation—or opposing both of them.It doesn’t have to be that way.In World 3.0, award-winning author and economist Pankaj Ghemawat reveals the folly in both of these responses. He calls for a third worldview—one in which both regulation and cross-border integration coexist and complement one another.Ghemawat starts by exposing common assumptions about globalization to hard data, proving that the world is not nearly as globalized as we think. And he explains why the potential gains from further integration are much larger than even pro globalizers tend to believe. He then tackles market failures and fears—job losses, environmental degradation, macroeconomic volatility, and trade and capital imbalances—that opponents of globalization often invoke. Drawing on compelling data, he shows that increased globalization can actually alleviate some of these problems. Finally, Ghemawat describes how a wide range of players—businesses, policy makers, citizens, media—can help open up flows of ideas, people, and goods across borders, but in ways that maximize the benefits and minimize the potential side effects. World 3.0 dispels powerfully entrenched—but incorrect—assumptions about globalization. Provocative and bold, this new book explains how people around the world can secure their collective prosperity through new approaches to cross-border integration.

This book explores historical data, analyzes current events from the world stage, and delivers a worldview that challenges some existing paradigms in business. As we are living business history, the book draws from the epic economic, environmental, and cultural shifts in our collective consciousness. It begins a vital conversation by introducing some thought paradigms that will challenge current business practices, create a vision for the future, and provide a road map to navigate this uncharted territory. In the end, the author outlines specific action that you must take now to end the economic and moral decline in this first part of the 21st century.","tags":["Business","Economics"]},{"id":"9780768686098","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"craigslist 4 Everyone","authors":["Jenna Lloyd","Sherry Kinkoph Gunter"],"pages":"320","publication_date":"October 2008","description":"Craigslist 4 Everyone\n\nJobs.

In the past few years Caesars, the world’s most geographically diversified gaming company, has come a long way toward earning a reputation as an environmental leader in the hospitality industry. It has received more than 50 awards and certifications for sustainability leadership. In just five years, the company has reduced its carbon footprint by nearly 10% and reduced its energy use per square foot by 20%.Gary Loveman, the company’s chairman and CEO, stepped up the company’s sustainability efforts beginning in 2007 as the economy was starting to weaken. Caesars’ revenues were collapsing, forcing the company to reduce staffing levels by more than 20 percent. Staff members were developing creative ways to cut costs, reduce energy consumption and waste, and increase recycling, and Loveman saw an opportunity to build on their initiative. The program, dubbed CodeGreen, has become institutionalized across more than 50 Caesars properties, in part by a scorecard that continues to be refined.Although Caesars’ properties have substantially reduced their carbon footprint and increased efficiencies, the next stage of Caesars’ sustainability program is still being mapped out. This case study features details about Caesar’s sustainability initiative, as well as expert commentary by two business school professors: Michael W.

On one hand, ever-growing productivity has reduced requirements for manual labor through automation. But, on other hand, huge unemployment created from reduction of workforce due to automaÂtion, has reduced the consumer purchasing power and is indirectly hurting the Return on Investments (RoI). This brings any further progress of technology to a standstill. For technology to progress both supply and demand have to grow. The supply comes from producÂtivity of workforce and demand comes from their wages. Hence, free markets must ensure that wages automatically catch up with ever-growing productivity, with minimal government inÂtervention. To avoid automation from destroying jobs in an economy, free markets should ensure that working hours of workforce be reduced during the waning phase of economy and increased during its waxing phase.","tags":["Business","Economics"]},{"id":"9780768683806","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Making a Living from Your eBay Business","authors":["Michael Miller"],"pages":"408","publication_date":"March 2005","description":"What might have started as an innocent hobby after cleaning out your closets one spring is now turning into a full-fledged day (or night) job. eBay can be a great place to sell your stuff and can be a profitable business, if you know what you're doing.

Yet unreliable forecasting, pervasive doomsaying, and whipsawing data severely hamper the task of decoding the landscape. Are disruptions transient and ephemeral—or permanent and structural? False alarms are costly traps, but so are true structural changes that go undetected.\n\nHow can leaders avoid these macro traps to make better tactical and strategic decisions?\n\nIn this perspective-shifting book, BCG Chief Economist Philipp Carlsson-Szlezak and Senior Economist Paul Swartz provide a fresh and accessible way to assess macroeconomic risk. Casting doubt on conventional model-based thinking, they demonstrate a more powerful approach to building sound macroeconomic judgment. Using incisive analysis built upon frameworks, historical context, and structural narratives—what they call \"economic eclecticism\"—the book empowers readers with the durable skills to assess continuously evolving risks in the real economy, the financial system, and the geopolitical arena.\n\nMoreover, the authors' more nuanced approach reveals that the all-too-common narratives of economic collapse and decline are often false alarms themselves, while the fundamental strengths of our current \"era of tightness\" become visible.\n\nWith rational optimism rather than gloom, Shocks, Crises, and False Alarms speaks to the key financial and macroeconomic controversies that define our times—and provides a compass for navigating the global economy.

Safronov"],"pages":"380","publication_date":"August 2023","description":"Safronov’s Nietzsche’s Political Economy is a pioneering appraisal of Nietzsche’s critique of industrial culture and its unfolding crisis. The author contends that Nietzsche remains unique in conceptualizing the upheavals of modern political economy in terms of the crisis of its governing values. Nietzsche scrutinises the norms which, not only preside over the unfathomable build-up in debt, the proliferation of meaningless, impersonal slavery and the rise of increasingly repressive social control systems, but inevitably set these precarious tendencies of modern political economy on a collision course liable to culminate in an unprecedented human and environmental catastrophe. Safronov explores the core themes of Nietzsche’s political economy—debt, slavery, and the division of labour—with reference to the influential views of Adam Smith and Karl Marx, as well as against the backdrop of the Long Depression (1873–1896), the first truly international crisis of industrial capitalism, during which most of Nietzsche’s work was completed.\n\nIn Nietzsche’s assessment, modern political economy is predicated on the valuations that diminish humankind’s prospects and harm the planet’s future by consistently enfeebling the present, as long as there is profit to be made from it. Nietzsche’s critical insight, which challenges the most fundamental tenet of modern economics and finance, is that in order to build a stronger and intrinsically more valuable future in lieu of simply speculating on it, as though the liberal Promised Land could descend upon us like the manna from heaven at the wave of an invisible hand [of the market], it is necessary to walk from the future we dare to envisage resolutely back to the present we inhabit to determine what demands achieving such a vision would impose upon us, instead of embellishing the ‘here and now’ by cynically discounting the future to the [net] value of the present while disparaging, disowning and rewriting the past to unburden ourselves of its troubling legacy, as we continue to frivolously squander its capital to the alluring tunes of the ‘sirens who in the marketplace sing to us of the future’. The enabling mechanism for changing our valuing perspectives, Nietzsche tells us, lies dormant in us and it must be unlocked before it is too late.","tags":["Business","Economics"]},{"id":"9783111215617","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"The Market Mind Hypothesis","authors":["Patrick Schotanus"],"pages":"493","publication_date":"October 2023","description":"What is economics’ missing link? Recent economic crises have had a devastating impact on society. Worryingly, they gravely risked a collapse of the financial system. These crises also painfully revealed economics’ blind spots. Crucially, economics is not an innocent bystander but central to the problem.\n\nIn this pioneering book, Patrick Schotanus explains that economics’ mechanical worldview is the ontological error which leads to flawed thinking and faulty practices. The Market Mind Hypothesis (MMH) thus calls it \"mechanical economics\": it not only erroneously views but also dangerously treats the economy as a machine, the market as an automaton, and its agents as robots. Inspired by heterodox economic and leading cognitive thinkers, this book offers an alternative paradigm. Central to MMH’s psychophysical worldview is the fact that consumers, investors, and other participants are conscious beings and that their minds’ extension makes consciousness a reality in markets, exemplified by market mood. Specifically, denial of the complex mind~matter exchanges as the essence of markets means the extended mind~body problem is economics’ elephant in the room.\n\nThe book argues that if mechanical economics is the answer, we have been asking the wrong questions. Moreover, we will not solve our economic predicaments by doubling down on the assumption of rationality, nor by identifying yet another behavioural bias. Instead, scholars and students of economics and finance as well as finance practitioners need to investigate—through cognitive economics—the deep links between markets and minds to better understand both.\n\nWith a foreword by investment strategist Russell Napier, an intermezzo by neuroscientist and complexity pioneer Scott Kelso, and an afterword by 4E cognition philosopher Julian Kiverstein.","tags":["Business","Economics"]},{"id":"9781136408991","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"E-Commerce and V-Business, 2nd Edition","authors":["Stuart Barnes"],"pages":"408","publication_date":"August 2007","description":"E-commerce and V-business examines the impact of the Internet and associated technologies on two related aspects of business: electronic commerce and virtual organization.

Even economists, finance specialists and market commentators are often uncertain of its causes or in the interpretation of events ongoing, or of past events that have taken place that then shaped the current situation. Typically this lack of understanding results from a lack of understanding of how European institutions work, the structure of European politics and the Eurozone, the economics of the financial system, or the relationship of debt markets to current government policies in the EU. The purpose of this book is to describe the causes and outcomes of the European debt crisis (to the date of publication) within the context of three questions most often asked about the debt crisis: (i) what happened? (ii) why did it happen? and (iii) why has the crisis been so difficult for policy-makers to address? The book attempts to answer these questions in a straightforward, scholarly and thoughtful fashion, thereby developing a wider understanding of the crisis in its entirety for the reader. The book is by no means meant to be an exhaustive treatment on any of the issues it discusses. But the approach taken should be useful for those people who wish to better understand the events of the European financial crisis over the past three years but who do not need to acquire an exhaustive background in European institutions, debt markets, history and economic policy-making. For that reason the proposed book would have appeal to undergraduate students in business, economics, politics or interdisciplinary studies looking for an approachable yet detailed overview of the crisis, for graduate classes seeking similar goals and lay-people or professionals interested generally in the topic and/or with a need to acquire a basic understanding of the topic. Further, the book could serve as an introduction in courses or settings that lead to deeper discussion of the economic, political, and financial issues it presents.","tags":["Business","Economics"]},{"id":"9780749466824","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Employee Engagement and Communication Research","authors":["Susan Walker"],"pages":"256","publication_date":"November 2012","description":"The complete handbook to measuring and evaluating employee engagement and offers a guide to implementing change based on results.","tags":["Business","Human Resources","Employee Surveys"]},{"id":"9781466565005","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Building Quality Management Systems","authors":["Luis Rocha-Lona","Jose Arturo Garza-Reyes","Vikas Kumar"],"pages":"202","publication_date":"August 2017","description":"Current and emerging trends in the domains of health management and the work sector, the abundance of new consumer products pervading the marketplace, and the desires of many older adults to undertake new learning experiences means that older adults, like their younger counterparts, will need to continually engage in new learning and training. Thus, understanding the challenges that older people face when confronted with new learning and training programs and developing potential strategies to overcome them is imperative. A comprehensive state-of-the-science review, Designing Training and Instructional Programs for Older Adults explores a broad range of issues, from the implications of theories of learning for designing instruction for older adults to adapting current perspectives on methods of instructional design to accommodate the capabilities and limitations of older learners. The authors provide an understanding of today‘s older adults their demographics, their needs, the challenges facing them, and a realistic appraisal of their abilities and limitations as a basis for how current knowledge about training and instructional design should be shaped and applied to best accommodate this population of learners. They discuss topics such as retention and transfer of training, sequencing the order of instruction, e-learning, multimedia training formats, and the assessment and evaluation of training programs from the perspective of issues relevant to older learners.

A continuation of the popular Frequency Synthesis by Phase Lock, Second Edition, this timely resource provides a broad introduction to sigma-delta by pairing practical simulation results with cutting-edge research. Advanced Frequency Synthesis by Phase Lock discusses both sigma-delta and fractional-n—the still-in-use forerunner to sigma-delta—employing Simulink® models and detailed simulations of results to promote a deeper understanding.\n\nAfter a brief introduction, the book shows how spurs are produced at the synthesizer output by the basic process and different methods for overcoming them. It investigates how various defects in sigma-delta synthesis contribute to spurs or noise in the synthesized signal. Synthesizer configurations are analyzed, and it is revealed how to trade off the various noise sources by choosing loop parameters. Other sigma-delta synthesis architectures are then reviewed.\n\nThe Simulink simulation models that provided data for the preceding discussions are described, providing guidance in making use of such models for further exploration. Next, another method for achieving wide loop bandwidth simultaneously with fine resolution—the Diophantine Frequency Synthesizer—is introduced. Operation at extreme bandwidths is also covered, further describing the analysis of synthesizers that push their bandwidths close to the sampling-frequency limit. Lastly, the book reviews a newly important technology that is poised to become widely used in high-production consumer electronics—all-digital frequency synthesis.\n\nDetailed appendices provide in-depth discussion on various stages of development, and many related resources are available for download, including Simulink models, MATLAB® scripts, spreadsheets, and executable programs. All these features make this authoritative reference ideal for electrical engineers who want to achieve an understanding of sigma-delta frequency synthesis and an awareness of the latest developments in the field.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Engineering","Electrical Engineering","Signal Processing"]},{"id":"9781118938249","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Simplified Robust Adaptive Detection and Beamforming for Wireless Communications","authors":["Ayman ElNashar"],"pages":"424","publication_date":"August 2018","description":"This book presents an alternative and simplified approaches for the robust adaptive detection and beamforming in wireless communications.

However, shore-based VFDs often are unsuitable for shipboard applications because the power generation and distribution fundamentals are completely different. VFD Challenges for Shipboard Electrical Power System Design explores the problems presented by variable frequency drives as they are applied in shipboard power generation and distribution system design and offers solutions for meeting these challenges.\n\nVFDs with configurations such as six pulse drive, 12 pulse drive, 18 pulse drive, active front end, pulse width modulation and many others generate many different levels of harmonics. These harmonics are often much higher than the regulations allow. This book covers a range of techniques used to provide ships with efficient energy that minimizes mechanical and electrical stress. This important book:\n\nOffers a comparison of shipboard grounding and VFD grounding\nContains an analysis of the VFD effect in terms of shipboard power quality\nIncludes specific examples of Department of Transportation standards regarding VFDs\n\nWritten for commercial and naval engineers designing ships and/or shipboard power systems, VFD Challenges for Shipboard Electrical Power System Design is a comprehensive resource that addresses the problems and solutions associated with shipboard applications of VFD.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Engineering","Electrical Engineering"]},{"id":"9780415831772","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Aspects of the Theory of Tariffs (Collected Works of Harry Johnson)","authors":["Harry Johnson"],"pages":"458","publication_date":"July 2013","description":"An internationally acknowledged authority on all aspects of the theory of international trade and payments, this book collects Harry Johnson’s contributions to the study of international trade, including a critique of the theory of effective protection.

With this framework, he introduces the reader to crucial concepts in signal processing such as continuous- and discrete-domain signals and systems, discrete-domain periodic signals, sampling and reconstruction, light and color, random field models, image representation and more. \n\nWhile most treatments use normalized representations for non-rectangular sampling, this approach obscures much of the geometrical and scale information of the signal. In contrast, Dr. Dubois uses actual units of space-time and frequency. Basis-independent representations appear as much as possible, and the basis is introduced where needed to perform calculations or implementations. Thus, lattice theory is developed from the beginning and rectangular sampling is treated as a special case. This is especially significant in the treatment of color and color image processing and for discrete transform representations based on symmetry groups, including fast computational algorithms. Other features include:\n\nAn entire chapter on lattices, giving the reader a thorough grounding in the use of lattices in signal processing\nExtensive treatment of lattices as used to describe discrete-domain signals and signal periodicities\nChapters on sampling and reconstruction, random field models, symmetry invariant signals and systems and multidimensional Fourier transformation properties\nSupplemented throughout with MATLAB examples and accompanying downloadable source code\n\nGraduate and doctoral students as well as senior undergraduates and professionals working in signal processing or video/image processing and imaging will appreciate this fresh approach to multidimensional signals and systems theory, both as a thorough introduction to the subject and as inspiration for future research.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Engineering","Electrical Engineering","Signal Processing"]},{"id":"9781119911067","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Extra Credit!","authors":["LaNesha Tabb","Naomi O'Brien"],"pages":"224","publication_date":"October 2022","description":"Learn to package your professional skill, monetize your interests, and share your teaching gifts with the world\n\nIn Extra Credit! 8 Ways to Turn Your Education Expertise into Passion Projects and Extra Income, a team of accomplished educators and content creators delivers an illuminating and engaging handbook for educators who seek to bring in extra income with their professional and personal talents.

This book describes the principles of MEMS via a unified approach and closed-form solutions to micromechanical problems, which have been recently developed by the author and go beyond what is available in other texts. The closed-form solutions allow the reader to easily understand the linear and nonlinear behaviors of MEMS and their design applications.\n\nBeginning with an overview of MEMS, the opening chapter also presents dimensional analysis that provides basic dimensionless parameters existing in large- and small-scale worlds. The book then explains microfabrication, which presents knowledge on the common fabrication process to design realistic MEMS. From there, coverage includes:\n\nStatics/force and moment acting on mechanical structures in static equilibrium\n\nStatic behaviors of structures consisting of mechanical elements\n\nDynamic responses of the mechanical structures by the solving of linear as well as nonlinear governing equations\n\nFluid flow in MEMS and the evaluation of damping force acting on the moving structures\n\nBasic equations of electromagnetics that govern the electrical behavior of MEMS\n\nCombining the MEMS building blocks to form actuators and sensors for a specific purpose\n\nAll chapters from first to last use a unified approach in which equations in previous chapters are used in the derivations of closed-form solutions in later chapters. This helps readers to easily understand the problems to be solved and the derived solutions. In addition, theoretical models for the elements and systems in the later chapters are provided, and solutions for the static and dynamic responses are obtained in closed-forms.\n\nThis book is designed for senior or graduate students in electrical and mechanical engineering, researchers in MEMS, and engineers from industry. It is ideal for radio frequency/electronics/sensor specialists who, for design purposes, would like to forego numerical nonlinear mechanical simulations. The closed-form solution approach will also appeal to device designers interested in performing large-scale parametric analysis.","tags":["Hardware","Embedded Systems","Microelectronics"]},{"id":"9783110468410","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Communication, Signal Processing & Information Technology","authors":["Faouzi Derbel","Nabil Derbel","Olfa Kanoun"],"pages":"249","publication_date":"July 2018","description":"The book elaborates selected, extended and peer reviewed papers on Communication and Signal Proceesing.

The result is imbalances between aggregate supply and aggregate demand that can cause economic contractions. These imbalances may be self-correcting, or they may become long-lived and require government intervention through the exercise of corrective monetary and fiscal policy.\n\nVolume I examines economic behavior on the assumption that economic agents correctly interpret the data before them. It thus takes a “micro foundations” approach, under which aggregate supply equals aggregate demand.\n\nVolume II allows for the possibility of myopia on the part of economic agents and for the resulting economic malperformance that can result from this myopia. It examines the short-run disparities between aggregate supply and aggregate demand that can result from ill-informed choices of individual economic agents or from a misdiagnosis of economic data by policy makers. It concludes with a review of recent U.S. economic policy.\n\nThe book aims to correct a good number of misconceptions that bedevil economic policymaking—among them the idea that protracted economic contractions necessarily call for increased government spending and lower taxes.

Most conference participants not only knew about this digital teaching and learning scenario but were experienced users and developers. While during its predecessors most participants wanted to familiarize themselves with the central components of the Inverted Classroom Model, the focus of the 3rd German Inverted Classroom Conference in 2014, to which this conference volume is dedicated, was not only a discussion of variants of the model but also, for the first time, the inclusion of long-term evaluations and aspects of student behavior.This shift of emphasis is reflected in the contributions to this volume. Even though all central aspects of the ICM - content production and delivery, testing, and the in-class phase - are still addressed, we can now find recommendations concerning digital material acquisition, in-class tuition, the role of student tutors as well as first long-term studies about ICM effects.In general then, the focus was much wider than that of the first two ICM-conferences: from a new and originally non-familiar teaching and learning scenario to more general aspects of digitization of teaching and learning in the 21st century.","tags":["Other","Education"]},{"id":"9789814613057","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Handbook of Nanomagnetism","authors":["Rosa A.

He argues that the current low interest rates and budget deficits have prevented the recession becoming a depression but that those policies cannot be continuously repeated and a new consensus for action must be found. He offers practical guidance on reducing government, household, and business debt; changing the economic incentives for the management class that currently inhibit long-term growth; and rebalancing national economies both internally and externally. Further, he explains how central bankers must broaden the economic theories that guide their decisions to include the major factors of debt and asset prices.\n\nOffers practical, real-world economic policies for restructuring and rebalancing the global economic system\n\nPresents a modern economic theory for preventing the next collapse\n\nIdeal for economists, investors, fund managers, and central bankers\n\nWritten by an economist described by the legendary Barton Biggs as \"one of the five best, most dispassionate, erudite analysts in the world\"\n\nAs the global economy continues the long climb out of recession, it's imperative that central bankers and other economic decision-makers not repeat the mistakes of the past.

What about asking a random person on the street if you could borrow their phone? If the idea makes you squeamish, you're not alone--social psychologists have found that doing these very things makes most of us almost unbearably uncomfortable.\n\nBut here's the funny thing: even though we hate to ask for help, most people are wired to be helpful. And that's a good thing, because every day in the modern, uber-collaborative workplace, we all need to know when and how to call in the cavalry.\n\nHowever, asking people for help isn't intuitive; in fact, a lot of our instincts are wrong. As a result, we do a poor job of calling in the reinforcements we need, leaving confused or even offended colleagues in our wake.\n\nThis pragmatic book explains how to get it right. With humor, insight, and engaging storytelling, Heidi Grant, PhD, describes how to elicit helpful behavior from your friends, family, and colleagues--in a way that leaves them feeling genuinely happy to lend a hand.\n\nWhether you're a first-time manager or a seasoned leader, getting people to pitch in is what leadership is. Fortunately, people have a natural instinct to help other human beings; you just need to know how to channel this urge into what it is you specifically need them to do. It's not manipulation. It's just management.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Communication","Emotional Intelligence"]},{"id":"9781422163245","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Ben Bernanke's Fed","authors":["Ethan S.

To date, the new chair has garnered mixed reviews. Business economists see him as the best-qualified successor to Greenspan, while many traders and investors worry that he's too academic for the job. Meanwhile, many ordinary Americans do not even know who he is.How will Bernanke's leadership affect the Fed's actions in the coming years? How will Bernanke build on Greenspan's success, but also put his own stamp on the Fed? What will all this imply for businesses and investors? In Ben Bernanke's Fed, Ethan Harris provides exceptional insights into these crucial issues.As a leading \"Fed watch\" economist, Harris draws on Bernanke's academic research, his speeches as a governor of the Fed, and his first two years on the job to shed light on:· How the Federal Reserve analyzes and manages the economy using a synthesis of classical and Keynesian theory· Bernanke's strategies for fighting inflation· The implications of the new chair's remarkably plain-spoken style· How Bernanke has cultivated diverse viewpoints but still builds consensus within the FedEngaging and discerning, this book demystifies the man who has stepped into what many describe as the second most powerful job in America.","tags":["Business","Economics"]},{"id":"9780415670487","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Wage-Fixing (Routledge Revivals)","authors":["J.

Various proposals for the reform of wage-fixing institutions are discussed, including the limitation of trade-union bargaining powers, an official incomes policy, labour management and ownership in business, and tax or subsidy measures to discourage inflationary rises in wages and prices.  \n\nThe book will be essential reading for all concerned with both the theory and policy of contemporary macroeconomics, industrial relations, labour economics and labour law. It has been written so that the general argument in the main text is accessible to the general reader as well as of interest to the professional economist.","tags":["Business","Economics"]}]
