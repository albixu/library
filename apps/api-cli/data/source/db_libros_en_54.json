The commercial world has rushed headlong into doing business on the Web, often without integrating sound security technologies and policies into their products and methods. The security risks--and the need to protect both business and personal data--have never been greater. We've updated Building Internet Firewalls to address these newer risks.\n\nWhat kinds of security threats does the Internet pose? Some, like password attacks and the exploiting of known security holes, have been around since the early days of networking. And others, like the distributed denial of service attacks that crippled Yahoo, E-Bay, and other major e-commerce sites in early 2000, are in current headlines.\n\nFirewalls, critical components of today's computer networks, effectively protect a system from most Internet security threats. They keep damage on one part of the network--such as eavesdropping, a worm program, or file damage--from spreading to the rest of the network. Without firewalls, network security problems can rage out of control, dragging more and more systems down.\n\nLike the bestselling and highly respected first edition, Building Internet Firewalls, 2nd Edition, is a practical and detailed step-by-step guide to designing and installing firewalls and configuring Internet services to work with a firewall.

How can you filter streams of complex information to pull out only what you want? Why does it matter how information is structured when Google seems to magically bring up the right answer to your questions? What does it mean to be \"findable\" in this day and age? This eye-opening new book examines the convergence of information and connectivity. Written by Peter Morville, author of the groundbreaking Information Architecture for the World Wide Web, the book defines our current age as a state of unlimited findability. In other words, anyone can find anything at any time. Complete navigability.\n\nMorville discusses the Internet, GIS, and other network technologies that are coming together to make unlimited findability possible. He explores how the melding of these innovations impacts society, since Web access is now a standard requirement for successful people and businesses. But before he does that, Morville looks back at the history of wayfinding and human evolution, suggesting that our fear of being lost has driven us to create maps, charts, and now, the mobile Internet.\n\nThe book's central thesis is that information literacy, information architecture, and usability are all critical components of this new world order. Hand in hand with that is the contention that only by planning and designing the best possible software, devices, and Internet, will we be able to maintain this connectivity in the future. Morville's book is highlighted with full color illustrations and rich examples that bring his prose to life.\n\nAmbient Findability doesn't preach or pretend to know all the answers. Instead, it presents research, stories, and examples in support of its novel ideas. Are we truly at a critical point in our evolution where the quality of our digital networks will dictate how we behave as a species? Is findability indeed the primary key to a successful global marketplace in the 21st century and beyond.

This book addresses the “what comes next? question by presenting the recently proposed waveform known as Orthogonal Time-Frequency-Space (OTFS), which offers a better alternative for high-mobility environments.\n\nThe OTFS waveform is based on the idea that the mobile wireless channels can be effectively modelled in the delay-Doppler domain. This domain provides a sparse representation closely resembling the physical geometry of the wireless channel. The key physical parameters such as relative velocity and distance of the reflectors with respect to the receiver can be considered roughly invariant in the duration of a frame up to a few milliseconds. This enables the information symbols encoded in the delay-Doppler domain to experience a flat fading channel even when they are affected by multiple Doppler shifts present in high-mobility environments.\n\nDelay-Doppler Communications: Principles and Applications covers the fundamental concepts and the underlying principles of delay-Doppler communications. Readers familiar with OFDM will be able to quickly understand the key differences in delay-Doppler domain waveforms that can overcome some of the challenges of high-mobility communications.

Design of these processes is made more complex because of the time dependent nature of the process and the allowable flexibility. More often than not, every unit encounters optimal control problems. Therefore, traditional design books have not covered batch processing in detail. Filling this void, Batch Processing: Modeling and Design describes various unit operations in batch and bio-processing as well as design methods for these units.\n\nTopics include:\n\nBatch distillation operating modes and configurations\nBatch absorption operations based on the solubility difference\nBatch adsorption based on differential affinity of various soluble molecules to solid absorbents\nBatch chromatography for measuring a wide variety of thermodynamic, kinetic, and physico-chemical properties\nBatch crystallization where a phase is used to find the supersaturation at which point material crystallizes\nBatch drying that stresses the phase diagram of water to describe this operation\nBatch filtration using a porous medium or screen to separate solids from liquids\nBatch centrifugation where centrifugal force is used for separation\n\nBatch processes are widely used in pharmaceutical, food, and specialty chemicals where high value, low volume products are manufactured. Recent developments in bio-based manufacturing also favor batch processes because feed variations can be easily handled in batch processes. Further, the emerging area of nanomaterials manufacturing currently uses batch processes as they are low volume, high energy intensive processes. With examples, case studies, and more than 100 homework problems, this book describes the unit operations in batch and bioprocessing and gives students a thorough grounding in the numerical methods necessary to solve these design problems.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Science","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering"]},{"id":"9789332537408","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Introduction to Biochemistry and Metabolism, 1/e","authors":["D.

Management is told of the necessity of the policy document, and they support its development. A manager or administrator is assigned to the task and told to come up with something, and fast! Once security policies are written, they must be treated as living documents. As technology and business requirements change, the policy must be updated to reflect the new environment--at least one review per year.

It remains, however, an often poorly understood afterthought. Many portfolios are designed without any thought given to risk management before they are handed off to a dedicated—but separate—risk management team.\n\nIn Strategic Risk Management: Designing Portfolios and Managing Risk, Campbell R. Harvey, Sandy Rattray, and Otto Van Hemert deliver a reimagining of the risk management process. The book envisions a marriage between the investment and risk processes, an approach that has proven successful at the world’s largest publicly listed hedge fund, Man Group.\n\nThe authors provide readers with a new framework for portfolio design that includes defensive strategies, drawdown risk controls, volatility targeting, and actively timing rebalancing trades. You will learn about how the book’s new approach to risk management fared during the recent market drawdown at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. You will also discover why the traditional risk weighting approach only works on certain classes of assets.\n\nThe book shows you how to accurately evaluate the costs of defensive strategies and which ones offer the best and most cost-effective protection against market downturns. Finally, you will learn how to obtain a more balanced return stream by targeting volatility rather than a constant notional exposure and gain a deeper understanding of concepts like portfolio rebalancing.\n\nPerfect for people working in the asset management industry and financial policy makers, Strategic Risk Management: Designing Portfolios and Managing Risk will also earn a place in the libraries of economics and finance scholars, as well as casual readers who take an active approach to investing in their savings or pension assets.\n\nPRAISE FOR STRATEGIC RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n“Strategic Risk Management shows how to fully embed risk management into the portfolio management process as an equal partner to alpha. This should clearly be best practice for all asset managers.”—Jase Auby, Chief Investment Officer, the Teacher Retirement System of Texas\n\n“This book shows the power of integrating risk and investment management, rather than applying risk management as an afterthought to satisfy set limits. I was pleased to shepherd some of the key ideas in this book through the publication process at The Journal of Portfolio Management.”—Frank J. Fabozzi, Editor, The Journal of Portfolio Management\n\n“Financial markets today are quite different from those of the last century. Understanding leverage, correlations, tails, and other risk parameters of a portfolio is at least as important as work on signals and alpha. In that sense, bringing risk management from ‘control’ to ‘front office’ should be a priority for asset managers. This book explains how to do it.”—Marko Kolanovic, Chief Global Market Strategist, J.P. Morgan\n\nA powerful new approach to risk management in volatile and uncertain markets\n\nWhile the COVID-19 pandemic threw the importance of effective risk management into sharp relief, many investment firms hang on to a traditional and outdated model of risk management. Using siloed and independent portfolio management and risk monitoring teams, these firms miss out on the opportunities presented by integrated risk management.\n\nStrategic Risk Management: Designing Portfolios and Managing Risk delivers a fresh approach to risk management in difficult market conditions.

Connie Brown has a global reputation of developing analysis that focuses on the integration of global markets. In a two book series you will be taken through the steps to master the global cash flows of today's financial markets. The approach found in this first book differs from the traditional view of EWP because it shows you how geometry and the use of simple boxes drawn within a trend will guide you away from the common complaint of subjectivity, thereby making smarter trades of higher probability. While EWP can be a challenging topic, the structure of this book eases you into the analysis principles.\n\nWith Mastering Elliott Wave Principle you are guided step-by-step through the learning phases of Elliott Wave analysis and then your understanding is further challenged through self-examination. The preliminary coaching unravels common misunderstandings that sabotage the beginner. You will discover how price swings and waves are not the same. Elements of balance and proportion are mathematical concepts taught through geometry and not subjective. These basic skills establish a foundation that allow beginners to understand what to expect from their level of skill. There are three distinct levels of skill that all masters of the EWP have learned. Now there is a series to guide your understanding at each skill level so you can develop a working knowledge of how to define market positions around the world in short or long term time horizons.

Have you ever wondered what you could do to encourage students to resist distractions and focus on the information you are presenting? Have you ever wished you could help students become active learners as they listen to you lecture?\n\nInteractive Lecturing is designed to help faculty members more effectively lecture. This practical resource addresses such pertinent questions as, “How can lecture presentations be more engaging?” “How can we help students learn actively during lecture instead of just sitting and passively listening the entire time?” Renowned authors Elizabeth F. Barkley and Claire H. Major provide practical tips on creating and delivering engaging lectures as well as concrete techniques to help teachers ensure students are active and fully engaged participants in the learning process before, during, and after lecture presentations.\n\nResearch shows that most college faculty still rely predominantly on traditional lectures as their preferred teaching technique. However, research also underscores the fact that more students fail lecture-based courses than classes with active learning components. Interactive Lecturing combines engaging presentation tips with active learning techniques specifically chosen to help students learn as they listen to a lecture. It is a proven teaching and learning strategy that can be readily incorporated into every teacher’s methods.\n\nIn addition to providing a synthesis of relevant, contemporary research and theory on lecturing as it relates to teaching and learning, this book features 53 tips on how to deliver engaging presentations and 32 techniques you can assign students to do to support their learning during your lecture.

In Having A Life: Self Pathology After Lacan, Lewis Kirshner takes this Lacanian question as the point of departure for a thoughtful meditation on the conceptual problems and clinical manifestations of pathologies of the self. Beginning with the case of Margaret Little, analyzed by D. W. Winnicott, and proceeding to extended case presentations from his own practice, Kirshner weaves together an avowedly American reading of Lacan with the approaches to self pathology of an influential coterie of theorists. By drawing out common threads in their respective discourses on the self, Kirshner achieves an original integration of Lacanian theory with other contemporary approaches to self pathology. Of special note is his ability to sustain a dialogue between Lacan and Kohut, whose shared clinical object, discernible through divergent vocabularies and conceptions, is the struggle of the subject to avoid fragmentation that would obliterate a sense of aliveness and preclude active engagement with the world. Kirshner's opening chapter on the gifted, troubled Margaret Little and his concluding chapter on the eminent political philosopher Louis Althusser, whose self pathology culminated in his strangling of his wife, Hélène Rytman, in 1980, frame a study that is brilliantly successful in bringing \"self\" issues down to the messy actualities of lived experience. Analytic therapists no less than students of the human sciences will be edified by this cogent, readable attempt to infuse Lacanian concepts with the conceptual rigor and clinical pragmatism of American psychoanalysis and to apply the resulting model of therapeutic action to a fascinating range of case material.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Development","Stress Management"]},{"id":"9780128006689","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Environmental Organic Chemistry for Engineers","authors":["James G.

Recent events have shown that cyber-attacks are now an everyday occurrence, and it is becoming clear that the impact of these can have devastating effects on organizations whether large or small, public or private sector. Cyber security is one aspect of information security, since the impacts or consequences of a cyber-attack will inevitably damage one or more of the three pillars of information security: the confidentiality, integrity or availability of an organization’s information assets. The main difference between information security and cyber security is that while information security deals with all types of information assets, cyber security deals purely with those which are accessible by means of interconnected electronic networks, including the Internet. Many responsible organizations now have robust information security, business continuity and disaster recovery programs in place, and it is not the intention of this book to re-write those, but to inform organizations about the kind of precautions they should take to stave off successful cyber-attacks and how they should deal with them when they arise in order to protect the day-to-day businesses.","tags":["Security"]},{"id":"9780805807264","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Philosophical and Foundational Issues in Measurement Theory","authors":["C.

It also states that measurement theory is supposed to analyze the concept of a scale of measurement, describe various types of scales and their uses, and formulate the conditions required for the existence of scales of various types. Since this approach dominates contemporary measurement theory, the volume begins with essays by some of its leading architects.

This particular symposium was conceived in reference to the 1974 symposium entitled Cognition and Instruction. In the 25 years since that symposium, reciprocal relationships have been forged between psychology and education, research and practice, and laboratory and classroom learning contexts. Synergistic advances in theories, empirical findings, and instructional practice have been facilitated by the establishment of new interdisciplinary journals, teacher education courses, funding initiatives, and research institutes. So, with all of this activity, where is the field of cognition and instruction? How much progress has been made in 25 years? What remains to be done? This volume proposes and illustrates some exciting and challenging answers to these questions. Chapters in this volume describe advances and challenges in four areas, including development and instruction, teachers and instructional strategies, tools for learning from instruction, and social contexts of instruction and learning. Detailed analyses of tasks, subjects' knowledge and processes, and the changes in performance over time have led to new understanding of learners' representations, their use of multiple strategies, and the important role of metacognitive processes. New methods for assessing and tracking the development and elaboration of knowledge structures and processing strategies have yielded new conceptualizations of the process of change. Detailed cognitive analysis of expert teachers, as well as a direct focus on enhancing teachers' cognitive models of learners and use of effective instructional strategies, are other areas that have seen tremendous growth and refinement in the past 25 years. Similarly, the strong impact of curriculum materials and activities based on a thorough cognitive analysis of the task has been extended to the use of technological tools for learning, such as intelligent tutors and complex computer based instructional interfaces. Both the shift to conducting a significant portion of the cognition and instruction research in real classrooms and the increased collaboration between academics and educators have brought the role of the social context to center stage.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Science","Psychology"]},{"id":"9780857086839","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Positive Thinking","authors":["Gill Hasson"],"pages":"208","publication_date":"December 2016","description":"Bestselling author Gill Hasson is back to help you learn how the power of positive thinking can change your life\n\nAre you stuck in a rut?

The POP3 model for online-only messaging is being taxed to its limit, and users clearly would like mail servers with more \"oomph.\" More specifically, the demand is for email servers that take advantage of centralized resources to manage mail, rather than heap more tasks on end-user computers. This clamor has resulted in the IMAP protocol being incorporated into virtually every major email server on the market. Those who haven't already installed IMAP are probably planning to do so. Managing IMAP is a movable feast of IMAP help. It is a handy guide for everyday tasks common to most IMAP servers as well as a concise reference to help navigate the sometimes sparsely and obtusely documented open source software. Whether the goal is more insight into the IMAP server and client or utility software, or big-picture strategic suggestions to get off a legacy system, Managing IMAP is here to help. This book is both a conceptual and a mechanical IMAP road map. Managers, system integrators, and system administrators on the front lines of Internet messaging will find it a valuable tool for IMAP system provision, maintenance and support. It is also useful if you're considering IMAP for your messaging system. Managing IMAP covers the IMAP protocol, setting up a client, IMAP security, performance monitoring, and tools. Several chapters are devoted specifically to two of the most popular servers: the University of Washington server and Cyrus, and detailed appendixes cover topics such as TCL, procmail, Sieve, and sendmail.","tags":["IT Operations","Service Administration","Email Servers"]},{"id":"9780124078147","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Introduction to Cyber-Warfare","authors":["Paulo Shakarian","Jana Shakarian","Andrew Ruef"],"pages":"336","publication_date":"May 2013","description":"Introduction to Cyber-Warfare: A Multidisciplinary Approach, written by experts on the front lines, gives you an insider's look into the world of cyber-warfare through the use of recent case studies.

Pettit","Keely L.

Although companies originally moved production offshore to countries such as India and China to take advantage of lower labor costs, events such as Iceland’s 2010 volcanic eruption and the Japanese tsunami in 2011 have shown that the vulnerabilities of extended supply chains are real and serious.\n\nLean supply-chain practices, designed to keep costs low in a stable business environment, can increase risk levels during disruptions due to the lack of buffer capacity. While companies tend to focus on the supply side of their supply chains when scanning for potential risk factors, they also need to pay attention to the customer side.\n\nApproaches to risk management such as enterprise risk management (ERM) and business continuity management (BCM) can help companies avoid supply-chain disruptions and recover normal operations quickly. But in the authors’ view, they rely too heavily on risk identification when many of the risks are unpredictable or unknowable before the fact. They also depend on statistical information that may not exist and address each risk independently. Finally, they are predicated on the goal of returning to a stable operating condition.\n\nBased on their work with a number of companies, including fashion retailer L Brands Inc. (formerly known as Limited Brands), Dow Chemical, Johnson & Johnson and Unilever, the authors present a comprehensive framework for assessing supply-chain vulnerabilities and addressing them through enhanced resilience capabilities. The framework, which they call Supply Chain Resilience Assessment and Management (SCRAM), is based on an explicit characterization and prioritization of the vulnerabilities that make an organization susceptible to disruptions, and the capabilities that help an organization anticipate and overcome disruptions. The framework is designed to help companies identify their most important supply-chain vulnerabilities and to set priorities for capabilities that need to be strengthened.","tags":["Security","Governance, Risk Management and Compliance (GRC)","Operational Risk"]},{"id":"9780137061402","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"A Practical Guide to Distributed Scrum","authors":["Elizabeth Woodward","Steffan Surdek","Matthew Ganis"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"June 2010","description":"Succeed with Scrum in Even the Largest, Most Complex Distributed Development Projects\n\nForewords by Ken Schwaber, Scott Ambler, Roman Pichler, and Matthew Wang\n\nThis is the first comprehensive, practical guide for Scrum practitioners working in large-scale distributed environments.

Graff","Kenneth R. van Wyk"],"pages":"224","publication_date":"June 2003","description":"Practically every day, we read about a new type of attack on computer systems and networks. Viruses, worms, denials of service, and password sniffers are attacking all types of systems -- from banks to major e-commerce sites to seemingly impregnable government and military computers --at an alarming rate. Despite their myriad manifestations and different targets, nearly all attacks have one fundamental cause: the code used to run far too many systems today is not secure. Flaws in its design, implementation, testing, and operations allow attackers all-too-easy access. Secure Coding, by Mark G. Graff and Ken vanWyk, looks at the problem of bad code in a new way. Packed with advice based on the authors' decades of experience in the computer security field, this concise and highly readable book explains why so much code today is filled with vulnerabilities, and tells readers what they must do to avoid writing code that can be exploited by attackers. Writing secure code isn't easy, and there are no quick fixes to bad code. To build code that repels attack, readers need to be vigilant through each stage of the entire code lifecycle:\n\nArchitecture: during this stage, applying security principles such as \"least privilege\" will help limit even the impact of successful attempts to subvert software.\n\nDesign: during this stage, designers must determine how programs will behave when confronted with fatally flawed input data. The book also offers advice about performing security retrofitting when you don't have the source code -- ways of protecting software from being exploited even if bugs can't be fixed.\n\nImplementation: during this stage, programmers must sanitize all program input (the character streams representing a programs' entire interface with its environment -- not just the command lines and environment variables that are the focus of most security analysis).\n\nTesting: during this stage, programs must be checked using both static code checkers and runtime testing methods -- for example, the fault injection systems now available to check for the presence of such flaws as buffer overflow.\n\nOperations: during this stage, patch updates must be installed in a timely fashion. In early 2003, sites that had diligently applied Microsoft SQL Server updates were spared the impact of the Slammer worm that did serious damage to thousands of systems.\n\nBeyond the technical, Secure Coding sheds new light on the economic, psychological, and sheer practical reasons why security vulnerabilities are so ubiquitous today. It presents a new way of thinking about these vulnerabilities and ways that developers can compensate for the factors that have produced such unsecured software in the past. It issues a challenge to all those concerned about computer security to finally make a commitment to building code the right way.","tags":["Security","Application Security","Secure Coding"]},{"id":"9781838986186","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Modern Programming: Object Oriented Programming and Best Practices","authors":["Graham Lee"],"pages":"266","publication_date":"June 2019","description":"This book offers a comprehensive exploration of object-oriented programming (OOP) and its use in building robust and efficient applications.

For the first time, the World Health Organization has classified burnout as a health problem. Renowned motivational speaker Eileen McDargh proposes that to tackle it, we must learn to break out of energy-draining thoughts and behaviors.Resilience, she argues, is strictly a matter of energy management--by better managing your energy, you can both build resiliency and overcome burnout. Breakthrough happens when our energy is consciously distributed to what matters most in our lives. So after a short survey that will tell you where you fit in a burnout and resiliency profile, McDargh helps pinpoint the causes of your burnout and examine the energy demands that keep you from refueling and recharging. She provides an in-depth energy analysis and gives you the keys to master the four dimensions that can give you a resilience breakthrough: head, heart, hands, and humor.McDargh guides the reader through the process of identifying energy drains and implementing strategies for handling them, whatever phase of life you are in.

Readers will learn to understand object-oriented design with inheritance or composition, object aggregation and association, and the difference between interfaces and implementations. Readers will also become more efficient and better thinkers in terms of object-oriented development.\n\nThis revised edition focuses on interoperability across various technologies, primarily using XML as the communication mechanism. A more detailed focus is placed on how business objects operate over networks, including client/server architectures and web services.\n\n“Programmers who aim to create high quality software–as all programmers should–must learn the varied subtleties of the familiar yet not so familiar beasts called objects and classes.

Protecting a business, including its information and intellectual property, physical infrastructure, employees, and reputation, has become increasingly difficult. Online threats come from all sides: internal leaks and external adversaries; domestic hacktivists and overseas cybercrime syndicates; targeted threats and mass attacks. And these threats run the gamut from targeted to indiscriminate to entirely accidental.\n\nAmong thought leaders and advanced organizations, the consensus is now clear. Defensive security measures: antivirus software, firewalls, and other technical controls and post-attack mitigation strategies are no longer sufficient. To adequately protect company assets and ensure business continuity, organizations must be more proactive. Increasingly, this proactive stance is being summarized by the phrase Intelligence-Led Security: the use of data to gain insight into what can happen, who is likely to be involved, how they are likely to attack and, if possible, to predict when attacks are likely to come. In this book, the authors review the current threat-scape and why it requires this new approach, offer a clarifying definition of what Cyber Threat Intelligence is, describe how to communicate its value to business, and lay out concrete steps toward implementing Intelligence-Led Security.\n\nLearn how to create a proactive strategy for digital security\nUse data analysis and threat forecasting to predict and prevent attacks before they start\nUnderstand the fundamentals of today's threatscape and how best to organize your defenses","tags":["Security"]},{"id":"9780137000821","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Winners Never Cheat","authors":["Jon M.

Fantastic!”\n\n--Ryan Frazier, Technology Strategist, Microsoft\n\n“...a tour de force that elegantly applies REST principles to the industry-standard SOA framework described in prior titles in this series.... This book is a must-read for anyone developing REST services.”\n\n--Dave Slotnick, Enterprise Architect, Rackspace Hosting\n\n“This book undoubtedly will help SOA to reap the benefits from the main value propositions of Web architecture....”\n\n--Dr. Erik Wilde, Architect, EMC Corporation\n\n“REST is so much more than just another type of interface implementation--SOA with REST shows how the ecosystem of service compositions changes as new opportunities arise for service composition architecture designs. A comprehensive guide and a must-read for any serious IT architect considering REST-style services for application architectures.”\n\n--Roger Stoffers, Solution Architect, Hewlett Packard\n\n“Service-orientation and REST both are architectural styles that are cornerstones of modern applications and cloud computing. Both aim to deliver scalable, interoperable solutions, but their different roots don’t always make them a natural fit. SOA with REST explains how the two styles can work together in enterprise environments. It discusses a design process for a services portfolio that meets the goals of SOA and at the same time designs services that comply with the established REST constraints. It also shows pragmatic approaches to meet enterprise-grade requirements with the REST programming style but relaxes constraints where necessary.”\n\n--Christoph Schittko, Director of Cloud Strategy, Microsoft\n\n“An excellent repertoire of service-oriented patterns that will prove handy when solving problems in the real world. The REST perspectives and principles will provide complete coverage of modern-day Web 2.0 style approaches. Highly recommended.”\n\n--Sid Sanyal, IT Architect, Zurich Financial Services\n\n“An inspirational book that provides deep insight into the design and development of next-generation service-oriented systems based on the use of REST. This book clarifies the convergence of SOA and REST with no-nonsense content that addresses common questions and issues head-on. An essential ‘instrument of modern service implementation’ and a powerful body of knowledge for software designers, architects, and consultants.”\n\n--Pethuru Raj, Ph.D., Enterprise Architecture (EA) Consultant, Wipro Consulting Services\n\n“REST and SOA are two of the most misunderstood terms in the software industry over the past decade. Yet the REST architectural style coupled with modern RESTful framework implementations provides a scalable and reliable approach to SOA. This book covers all you need to know about how to take the principles of REST and apply them in small and large SOA developments. If you are familiar with REST and thinking about SOA, then you need this book. If you have not considered REST in your SOA work, then this book is for you, too. Covering concepts of both REST and SOA, as well as design patterns and when to use them, the book is a wonderful companion and a good tool for architects and engineers.”\n\n--Dr. Mark Little, CTO JBoss, Red Hat\n\n“Unlike many other texts on the subject, SOA with REST is a well-rounded, easy-to-read narrative, including real-world case studies that appeal to both developers and analysts. This makes it an indispensable source for any SOA practitioner or any professional who is planning to initiate an SOA project.”\n\n--Theodore T. Morrison, Certified SOA Analyst, CSM, Geocent, LLC\n\n“SOA and REST are two very important architectural styles for distributed computing. SOA is successfully adopted by most enterprises, and the REST style is getting more attention from both researcher and industry users. The book SOA with REST introduces a new architectural style that is ingeniously combining both SOA and REST styles and clearly reveals how SOA and REST can work together to generate successful enterprise SOA strategies with REST, along with guidance for making architecture design decisions. This book is a bible of best practices for designing and implementing SOA architecture with REST. It is a must-have reference book for both IT practitioners and researchers.”\n\n--Longji Tang, FedEx IT Senior Technical Advisor, Ph.D. in CSSE\n\nThe Definitive Guide to Building Web-Centric SOA with REST\n\nThe World Wide Web is based on the most successful technology architecture in history. It has changed how we view, access, and exchange information and, with the advent of REST, it has also provided us with compelling ways to build and improve automation solutions. REST provides a great deal of guidance to ensure that an architecture and its automation logic are technically sound, though it is still your responsibility to build services that actually add value to your business.\n\nSOA with REST is the first comprehensive tutorial and reference for designing and building RESTful services as part of service-oriented solutions and in conjunction with service-oriented architecture (SOA). This book demonstrates that REST is not only a suitable medium for building truly service-oriented solutions, but also that the service-oriented architectural model is a necessary foundation for REST technology architectures to realize their full business potential.\n\nThe authors provide thorough mapping of REST constraints and architectural goals with service-orientation principles and SOA characteristics. Using real-world examples, they show how to leverage REST’s simplicity, flexibility, and low overhead without compromising the power or manageability of service-oriented solutions and architectures.\n\nThis book will be valuable to IT architects, developers, and any practitioner seeking to use SOA and REST together.\n\nTopic Areas\n\nDistributed solution design with HTTP and REST\n\nREST-based service composition architectures\n\nREST service modeling and a service-oriented analysis process for REST service candidates\n\nTechnical service contract notation for REST services based on a uniform contract\n\nDesigning REST service contracts with service-orientation\n\nUnderstanding REST constraints in relation to service-orientation principles\n\nUsing hypermedia and dynamic binding within SOA and service compositions\n\nCreating complex HTTP-based methods for enterprise solutions\n\nAdvanced design techniques, including composition deepening, runtime logic deferral, and dynamic binding with common properties\n\nCross-service transactions and event-driven messaging with REST\n\nAddressing enterprise solution concerns in relation to REST-based state management\n\nApplying SOA design patterns to REST-based solutions\n\nDistinguishing REST and SOA service concepts and terminology\n\nDesigning REST architectures with SOA\n\nVersioning REST services and uniform contracts\n\nFundamental REST, SOA, and service-orientation concepts and terminology\n\nREST constraints, REST architectural goals, and properties\n\nSeven new REST-inspired design patterns\n\nDefining common goals of REST and SOA\n\n.","tags":["Software Development","Software Architecture","Architectural Patterns","Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)"]},{"id":"9780470457412","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Get The Job You Want, Even When No One's Hiring: Take Charge of Your Career, Find a Job You Love, and Earn What You Deserve","authors":["Ford R.

These are increasing rapidly. We experience remnants of Deathworlds within our Lifeworlds (for example traumatic echoes of war, genocide, oppression). Many practices and policies, directly or indirectly, are \"Deathworld-Making.\" They undermine Lifeworlds contributing to community decline, illnesses, climate change, and species extinction. This book highlights the ways in which writing about and sharing meaningful experiences may lead to social and environmental justice practices, decreasing Deathworld-Making. Phenomenology is a method which reveals the connection between personal suffering and the suffering of the planet earth and all its creatures. Sharing can lead to collaborative relationships among strangers for social and environmental justice across barriers of culture, politics, and language.\n\n\"Deathworlds into Lifeworlds　wakes people up to how current economic and social forces are destroying life and communities on our planet, as I　have mapped in my work.　The chapters by scholars around the world in this　powerful book testify to the pervasive　consequences of the proliferation of Deathworld-making and ways that collaboration across cultures can help move us forward.\"\n\n—Saskia Sassen is the Robert S. Lynd Professor of Sociology at Columbia University and a Member of its Committee on Global Thought.\n\n\"Recognizing the inseparability of experience, consciousness, environment and problematics in rebalancing life systems, this book offers solutions from around the world.\"\n\n—Four Arrows, aka Don Trent Jacobs, author of Sitting Bull's Words for A World in Crises, et al.\n\n\"This unique book brings together 78 participants from 11 countries to reveal the ways in which phenomenology –　the study of consciousness and phenomena — can lead to profound personal and social transformation.　 Such transformation is especially powerful when \"Deathworlds\" – physical or cultural places that no longer sustain life – are transformed into \"lifeworlds\" through collaborative sharing, even when (or, perhaps, especially when) the sharing is among strangers across different cultures. The contributors share a truly wide range of human experiences, from the death of a child to ecological destruction, in offering ways to affirm life in the face of what may seem to be hopeless death-affirming challenges.\"\n\n—Richard P. Appelbaum, Ph.D., is Distinguished Research Professor Emeritus and former MacArthur Foundation Chair in Global and International Studies and Sociology at the University of California, Santa Barbara. He is also a founding Professor at Fielding Graduate University, where he heads the doctoral concentration in Sustainability Leadership.\n\n\"Deathworlds is a love letter for the planet—our home. By documenting places that no longer sustain life, the authors collectively pull back the curtain on these places, rendering them meaningful by connecting what ails us with what ails the world.\"\n\n—Katrina S. Rogers, Ph.D., conservation activist and author\n\n\"Deathworlds to Lifeworlds represents collaboration among Fielding Graduate University, the University of Łodź (Poland), and the University of the Virgin Islands. Students and faculty from these universities participated in seminars on transformative phenomenology and developed rich phenomenologically based narratives of their experiences or others’. These phenomenological protocol narratives creatively modify and integrate with everyday experience the conceptual frameworks of Husserl, Schutz, Heidegger, Habermas, and others. The diverse protocol authors demonstrate how phenomenological reflection is transformative first by revealing how Deathworlds, which lead to physical, mental, social, or ecological decline, imperil invaluable lifeworlds. Deathworlds appear on lifeworld fringes, such as extra-urban trash landfills, where unnoticed impoverished workers labor to the destruction of their own health. Poignant protocol-narratives highlight the plight and noble struggle of homeless people, the mother of a dying 19-year-old son, persons inclined to suicide, overwhelmed first responders, alcoholics who through inspiration achieve sobriety, unravelled We-Relationships, those suffering from and overcoming addiction or misogynist stereotypes or excessive pressures, veterans distraught after combat, a military mother, those in liminal situations, and oppressed indigenous peoples who still make available their liberating spirituality. Transformative phenomenology exemplifies that generous responsiveness to the ethical summons to solidarity to which Levinas’s Other invites us.\"\n\n—Michael Barber, Ph.D., Professor of Philosophy, St. Louis University. He has authored seven books and more than 80 articles in the general area of phenomenology and the social world. He is editor of　Schützian Research, an annual interdisciplinary journal.\n\n\"This book helps us notice the Deathworlds that surround us and advocates for their de-naturalization. Its central claim is that the ten virtues of the transformative phenomenologist allow us to do so by changing ourselves and the worlds we live in.\n\nIn this light, the book is an outstanding presentation of the international movement known as \"transformative phenomenology.\" It makes groundbreaking contributions to a tradition in which some of the authors are considered the main referents. Also, it offers an innovative understanding of Alfred Schutz’s philosophy of the Lifeworld and a fruitful application of Van Manen’s method of written protocols.\"\n\n—Carlos Belvedere, Ph.D., Professor, Faculty of Social Sciences, University of Buenos Aires\"\n\n\"Moving beyond the social phenomenology carved out by Alfred Schütz, this impressive volume of action-based experiential research displays the efficacy of applying phenomenological protocols to explore Deathworlds, the tacit side of the foundational conception of Lifeworlds. Over twenty-one chapters, plus an epilogue, readers are transported by the train of Transformative Phenomenology, created during what’s been called the Silver Age of Phenomenology (1996 – present) at the Fielding Graduate University. An international amalgam of students and faculty from universities in Poland, the United States, the Virigin Islands, Canada, and socio-cultural locations throughout the world harnessed their collective energy to advance the practical call of phenomenology as a pathway to meaning-making through rich descriptions of lived experience. Topics include dwelling with strangers, dealing with trash, walking with the homeless, death of a young person, overcoming colonialism, precognition, environmental destruction, and so much more. The research collection enhances what counts as phenomenological inquiry, while remaining respectful of Edmund Husserl’s philosophical roots.\"\n\n—David Rehorick, PhD, Professor Emeritus of Sociology, University of New Brunswick (Canada) & Professor Emeritus, Fielding Graduate University (U.S.A.), Vancouver, British Columbia.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Development"]},{"id":"9781292015330","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Brilliant Answers to Tough Interview Questions, 5th Edition","authors":["Mrs. Susan Hodgson"],"pages":"312","publication_date":"January 2015","description":"What does it take to really shine in any interview?\n\nLearn how to recognise your strengths and play to them, how to deal with your weak spots and avoid panic and clichéd answers.

It proposes that the concept of information is the inner essence of what we today call life. The importance of information for our species is obvious. Human beings are highly dependent on information, constantly exchanging with conspecifics. In a less apparent way, we are the product of genetic and epigenetic information which determines our development in a given environment from a fertilized egg to the adult stage. Even less apparent is that information plays a determining role in ecosystems. This observation may include the prebiotic systems in which life emerged. Our claim is that Nature processes information continuously. This means that even beyond living entities, we can see messages and decoding procedures. Nature can be said to send messages to its own future and then to decode them. Nature “talks” to itself! The systematic organization of messages suggests that, in some respects, we should even speak of the “languages” of Nature.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Science","Biology"]},{"id":"9781789800180","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Getting Started with SketchUp Pro","authors":["David S.

Since the 18th century, one has extensively used techniques such as perturbation methods to obtain approximate analytical solutions of periodic motions in nonlinear systems. However, the perturbation methods cannot provide the enough accuracy of analytical solutions of periodic motions in nonlinear dynamical systems. So the bifurcation trees of periodic motions to chaos cannot be achieved analytically. The author has developed an analytical technique that is more effective to achieve periodic motions and corresponding bifurcation trees to chaos analytically.\n\nToward Analytical Chaos in Nonlinear Systems systematically presents a new approach to analytically determine periodic flows to chaos or quasi-periodic flows in nonlinear dynamical systems with/without time-delay. It covers the mathematical theory and includes two examples of nonlinear systems with/without time-delay in engineering and physics. From the analytical solutions, the routes from periodic motions to chaos are developed analytically rather than the incomplete numerical routes to chaos. The analytical techniques presented will provide a better understanding of regularity and complexity of periodic motions and chaos in nonlinear dynamical systems.\n\nKey features:\n\nPresents the mathematical theory of analytical solutions of periodic flows to chaos or quasieriodic flows in nonlinear dynamical systems\n\nCovers nonlinear dynamical systems and nonlinear vibration systems\n\nPresents accurate, analytical solutions of stable and unstable periodic flows for popular nonlinear systems\n\nIncludes two complete sample systems\n\nDiscusses time-delayed, nonlinear systems and time-delayed, nonlinear vibrational systems\n\nIncludes real world examples\n\nToward Analytical Chaos in Nonlinear Systems is a comprehensive reference for researchers and practitioners across engineering, mathematics and physics disciplines, and is also a useful source of information for graduate and senior undergraduate students in these areas.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Science","Physics"]},{"id":"9781567263749","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The COR/COTR Answer Book, 3rd Edition","authors":["Bob Boyd"],"pages":"414","publication_date":"June 2012","description":"The Classic COR/COTR Reference Updated!Incorporating the most important changes to regulations affecting federal acquisition, this third edition of The COR/COTR Answer Book remains the “go to” reference for CORs, COs, and other acquisition professionals.Included in this third edition are:• Updated and expanded coverage of the policies and regulations on government property• Revised dollar thresholds that comply with the most recent changes• In-depth coverage of performance-based paymentsCoverage of the new FAR rules on COR certification details the elements of this new three-tiered mandatory certification program, along with the requirements on training, experience, and continuous learning. The easy-to-use question and answer format facilitates quick access to specific information.

Breyfogle III, CEO, Smarter Solutions, Inc.\n\n\"Finally, a book that bridges the software and hardware process tool set. To date, there have been hardware and software engineers who for one reason or another have not communicated their process methods. And so, myths formed that convinced the hardware community that CMMI was only for software and likewise convinced the software community that Six Sigma was only for hardware. It is both refreshing and thought provoking to dispel these myths.\"\n\n—Jack Ferguson, Manager, SEI Appraisal Program, Software Engineering Institute\n\nCMMI and Six Sigma represent two of the best-known process improvement initiatives. Both are designed to enhance work quality and thereby produce business advantages for an organization. It's a misconception that the two are in competition and cannot be implemented simultaneously. Practitioners originally trained in either CMMI or Six Sigma are now finding that the two initiatives work remarkably well together in the pursuit of their common goal.\n\nCMMI® and Six Sigma: Partners in Process Improvement focuses on the synergistic, rather than competitive, implementation of CMMI and Six Sigma—with synergy translating to \"faster, better, cheaper\" achievement of mission success. Topics range from formation of the value proposition to specific implementation tactics. The authors illustrate how not taking advantage of what both initiatives have to offer puts an organization at risk of sinking time, energy, and money into \"inventing\" a solution that already exists. Along the way they debunk a few myths about Six Sigma applications in software.\n\nWhile the authors concentrate on the interoperability of Six Sigma and CMMI, they also recognize that organizations rarely implement only these two initiatives. Accordingly, the discussion turns to the emerging realm of \"multimodel\" process improvement and strategies and tactics that transcend models to help organizations effectively knit together a single unified internal process standard.\n\nWhether you work in the defense industry, for a commercial organization, or for a government agency—wherever quality and efficiency matter—you'll find this book to be a valuable resource for bridging process issues across domains and building an improvement strategy that succeeds.","tags":["Software Development","QA / Testing","Six Sigma"]},{"id":"9781786304025","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Information, Knowledge and Agile Creativity","authors":["Stéphane Goria","Pierre Humbert","Benoit Roussel"],"pages":"284","publication_date":"December 2019","description":"Information, Knowledge and Agile Creativity will enlighten entrepreneurs, and is ideal for facilitating an organization’s ability to react and adapt to its environment.

In this book Yiassemides suggests that temporality plays an important role in many of Jung's central ideas, and is closely interlinked with his overall approach to the psyche and the cosmos at large.\n\nJung proposed a profound truth: that time is relative at large. To appreciate the whole of our experience we must reach beyond causality and temporal linearity, to develop an approach that allows for multidimensional and synchronistic experiences. Jung’s understanding surpassed Freud's dichotomous approach which restricted timelessness to the unconscious; his time theory allows us to reach beyond the everyday time-bound world into a greater realm, rich with meaning and connection.\n\nIncluded in the book:\n\n-Jung’s time theory\n\n-the death of time\n\n-time and spatial metaphors\n\n-the role of time in precognition, telepathy and synchronicity -Unus mundus and time\n\n-a comparison of Freud’s and Jung’s time theories: temporal directionality, dimensionality, and the role of timelessness.\n\nThis book is the first to explore time and timelessness in a systematic manner from a Jungian perspective, and the first to investigate how the concept of time affected the overall development of Jung's theory.

While most people realize they have more to learn, many have trouble translating that anxious need into purposeful action. Managing Your Own Learning demonstrates how to analyze previous learning, design an action plan for future learning, expand opportunities for learning, and use libraries and the Internet effectively to become a lifelong learner.James and Adelaide Davis detail seven major ways of learning: learning new skills, learning from presentations, learning to think, learning to solve problems and make decisions, learning in groups, learning through virtual realities, and learning from experience. They also provide useful guidelines for maximizing results by becoming an effective, active participant in learning. They explain, for example, how learning in a group can be enhanced by knowing how a group works and considering factors such as group size, cohesion, task and process behavior, and participant roles, as well as the things that can go wrong in groups, such as conflict and apathy.For each of the seven ways of learning, the authors tell what is unique about it, how learning actually takes place, and how it can be augmented in each situation. They reveal how the theory behind each way of learning originated, what researchers have learned about it, and what the individual's role is as a participant. And at the end of each chapter, they include a list of ten things that anyone can do to get the most from that particular type of learning.No matter what our previous experiences with learning may have been, we all must become self-directed learners if we are to succeed in this new era. Managing Your Own Learning provides step-by-step, proven advice on how to succeed in the 21st century workplace by becoming a proactive, goal-directed, perpetual learner.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Development"]},{"id":"9781259642944","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"IT's About Patient Care: Transforming Healthcare Information Technology the Cleveland Clinic Way","authors":["Harris","Gene Lazuta"],"pages":"240","publication_date":"October 2016","description":"A proven working model of healthcare IT as a transformative clinical and business engine—from one of the world’s leading healthcare organizations\n\nExciting new technology is revolutionizing healthcare in the twenty-first century.

Over several generations, families who are successful in growing their wealth have been able to reinvent themselves and their business in the face of significant environmental transformations and internal differences cause by family dynamics. Borrowed from my Grandchildren is a fascinating look at how large, long-lasting business families succeed across generations. \n\nAuthor Dennis T. Jaffe, one of the leading architects of the field of family enterprise consulting, has interviewed members of successful, well known, 100-year family enterprises from 20 countries, who serve as role models for those wishing to see their wealth positively impact their children, employees, and communities. Half continue to own their legacy business and others have gone on to become family offices with a portfolio of shared assets, but all these families have sustained their values and identity as a family over more than three generations.  \n\nOffering the collected wisdom of nearly 100 global business families, this insightful book shares the real-life stories of partners in business and wealth management over three of more generations. Families that generate rather than reduce their wealth across generations, known as Generative Families, focus on engaging across generations and develop collaborative governance for both family and business to ensure responsible stewardship from one generation to the next. \n\nThis unique resource:\n\nPresents real-life stories of families sustaining wealth over generations\nExplores both the successes and failures of retaining family wealth\nIncludes rare private insights from members of prominent wealthy families\nExamines the nature of global family enterprises and their evolution over generations\nDiscusses the financial, human, and social dimensions of wealth\n\nBorrowed from my Grandchildren: The Evolution of Stewardship in 100-Year Families is an essential read for family members, non-family executives, family offices, estate planning lawyers, family business consultants, trust officers, philanthropic and foundation advisors, financial advisors, financial planners, CPAs, and other finance professionals.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Development","Life-Work Balance"]},{"id":"9781422195154","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Work Smarter, Rule Your Email","authors":["Alexandra Samuel"],"pages":"80","publication_date":"February 2014","description":"If you’re looking for a way to more effectively manage your inbox, your email program’s built-in filtering tools can do a lot of the heavy lifting—and this short book by social media expert Alexandra Samuel shows you how to set them up.

As anyone who's part of such a relationship knows, this presents big challenges: trying to raise kids and achieve career goals while caring for and supporting your partner can seem impossible. Yet most advice for dual-career couples fails, framing the challenges as a zero-sum game in which one partner’s gain is the other's loss and solutions feel like sacrifices or unsatisfactory trade-offs.\n\nThis book is different. In Couples That Work, INSEAD professor Jennifer Petriglieri rejects conventional, one-size-fits-all solutions and instead focuses on how dual-career couples can tackle and resolve the challenges they face throughout their lives--together. She identifies three key phases of exploration and personal growth in every couple's work-life journey, showing how partners must navigate these together to strengthen their bond. Each phase is crystallized with a question:\n\nHow can we make this work? The first phase focuses on the logistics of combining two busy lives and often involves the demands of young children.\nWhat do we really want? In the second phase, couples learn to navigate their midlife crises in ways that allow each partner to continue to feel happy and fulfilled.\nWho are we now? With careers winding down and kids grown up, this last phase offers new freedoms--and uncertainties.\n\nBased on a five-year research project, the book includes interviews with couples from over thirty countries--from executives to entrepreneurs and from twentysomething newlyweds to dual-career grandparents.\n\nFilled with vivid real-life stories, keen insights, and engaging exercises, Couples That Work will help couples develop their own unique answers to that most pressing question: How can we successfully combine love and work?","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Development"]},{"id":"9781631572555","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Managerial Forensics","authors":["J.

However, climate change adds a new dimension to the task of developing and testing science-based management options to deal with the effects of stressors on forest ecosystems in the southern United States. The large spatial scale and complex interactions make traditional experimental approaches difficult. Yet, the current progression of climate change science offers new insights from recent syntheses, models, and experiments, providing enough information to start planning now for a future that will likely include an increase in disturbances and rapid changes in forest conditions.Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation Management Options: A Guide for Natural Resource Managers in Southern Forest Ecosystems provides a comprehensive analysis of forest management options to guide natural resource management in the face of future climate change. Topics include potential climate change impacts on wildfire, insects, diseases, and invasives, and how these in turn might affect the values of southern forests that include timber, fiber, and carbon; water quality and quantity; species and habitats; and recreation. The book also considers southern forest carbon sequestration, vulnerability to biological threats, and migration of native tree populations due to climate change.This book utilizes the most relevant science and brings together science experts and land managers from various disciplines and regions throughout the south to combine science, models, and on-the-ground experience to develop management options. Providing a link between current management actions and future management options that would anticipate a changing climate, the authors hope to ensure a broader range of options for managing southern forests and protecting their values in the future.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Science","Climate Change"]},{"id":"9780789743848","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Facebook® Marketing","authors":["Justin R.

Whether it's a private college, a hospital or museum, a lobbying group, or a local, low-budget food shelf, operational and marketing costs and capital investments are often largely underwritten through the generous support of donors. Nonprofits need some people to write $25 checks on a regular basis, and they need others to make six-figure pledges. The bad news: Since the economic collapse of 2008, getting people to part with precious dollars has become ever more difficult. The good news is that people are still inclined to be generous to organizations, causes, and candidates they believe in. Effective Frontline Fundraising provides the information you'll need to set up and manage an effective development team capable of consistently raising gifts, both large and small.\n\nEffective Frontline Fundraising will not only teach those skills for getting the gift you want in the short run, but it will also show how to build a meaningful, long-lasting relationship between your organization and your donor base. This book:\n\nShows how to keep that organizational lifeblood—cash—running through your vital operations\n\nExplains how to create a firm foundation from which to solicit funds\n\nProvides examples of successful and unsuccessful fundraising messages and plans\n\nTeaches you how to ask confidently for gifts from $25 to $1,000,000 ... or more!\n\nWhat you'll learn\n\nYou will learn to:\n\nRecruit a rock-solid development team\n\nDevise and implement an annual fundraising plan\n\nCraft a motivating fundraising message\n\nTime your solicitations to maximize return\n\nMaintain positive relationships with your donor base\n\nGain an understanding of the gift cycle\n\nLeverage volunteers, events, and other development resources and opportunities\n\nBuild the confidence to make the \"big ask\" for major gifts\n\nWho this book is for\n\nEffective Frontline Fundraising is geared toward small to medium nonprofits that are just beginning to professionalize their development offices.

While the importance of cryptographic technique, i.e., encryption, in protecting sensitive and critical information and resources cannot be overemphasized, an examination of the technical evolution within several industries reveals an approaching precipice of scientific change.\n\nThe glacially paced but inevitable convergence of quantum mechanics, nanotechnology, computer science, and applied mathematics will revolutionize modern technology. The implications of such changes will be far-reaching, with one of its greatest impacts affecting information security and, more specifically, modern cryptography.\n\nThe book takes the reader through these issues. As the security systems design becomes more and more complex to meet these challenges, a mistake that is committed most often by security specialists is not making a comprehensive analysis of the system to be secured before choosing which security mechanism to deploy. Often, the security mechanism chosen turns out to be either incompatible with, or inadequate for, handling the complexities of the system. In addition, the book also discusses three main points:\n\nConfiguration management is a critical issue, and as networks are increasing in size, their configuration needs to be managed. Devices may conflict with each other in terms of configuration. Therefore, it becomes challenging for firewalls to be up-to-date according to network policies.\nScalability of the network is another big challenge, it would be easier to address if the network stays the same, but the network is ever expanding with a constant increase in the number of devices devoted to the network.\nVendor lock-in: Business decisions that are taken today are revolving around the assumptions and capabilities of the current vendor and environment scenario. Buying the best solutions from today’s vendors involves how to interoperate, integrate, and support multiple solutions. It may involve tearing out all of the longstanding kits without tearing down the entire network at the same time.\n\nAudience\n\nThis book specifically appeals to industry practitioners, IT researchers, and students regarding network technological management.","tags":["Security"]},{"id":"9781466517998","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Biohydrogen Production","authors":["Debabrata Das","Namita Khanna","Chitralekha Nag Dasgupta"],"pages":"408","publication_date":"February 2014","description":"Biohydrogen Production: Fundamentals and Technology Advances covers the fundamentals of biohydrogen production technology, including microbiology, biochemistry, feedstock requirements, and molecular biology of the biological hydrogen production processes.

Optical fiber sensors, an important application of the optical fiber, have experienced fast development, and attracted wide attentions in basic science as well as in practical applications. Sensing is often likened to human sense organs. Optical fiber can not only transport information acquired by sensors at high speed and large volume, but also can play the roles of sensing element itself. Compared with electric and other types of sensors, fiber sensor technology has unique merits. It has advantages over conventional bulky optic sensors, such as combination of sensing and signal transportation, smaller size, and possibility of building distributed systems. Fiber sensor technology has been used in various areas of industry, transportation, communication, security and defense, as well as daily life. Its importance has been growing with the advancement of the technology and the expansion of the scope of its application, a growth this book fully describes.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Science","Physics","Optics"]},{"id":"9781439819517","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Random Light Beams","authors":["Olga Korotkova"],"pages":"366","publication_date":"December 2017","description":"This book provides an overview of recent discoveries in random beams and outlines possible uses of these beams in imaging, tomography, and smart illumination.

By allowing designers to create circuit architectures developed for the specific applications, high levels of performance can be achieved for many DSP applications providing considerable improvements over conventional microprocessor and dedicated DSP processor solutions. The book addresses the key issue in this process specifically, the methods and tools needed for the design, optimization and implementation of DSP systems in programmable FPGA hardware. It presents a review of the leading-edge techniques in this field, analyzing advanced DSP-based design flows for both signal flow graph- (SFG-) based and dataflow-based implementation, system on chip (SoC) aspects, and future trends and challenges for FPGAs. The automation of the techniques for component architectural synthesis, computational models, and the reduction of energy consumption to help improve FPGA performance, are given in detail.\n\nWritten from a system level design perspective and with a DSP focus, the authors present many practical application examples of complex DSP implementation, involving:\n\nhigh-performance computing e.g. matrix operations such as matrix multiplication;\n\nhigh-speed filtering including finite impulse response (FIR) filters and wave digital filters (WDFs);\n\nadaptive filtering e.g. recursive least squares (RLS) filtering;\n\ntransforms such as the fast Fourier transform (FFT).\n\nFPGA-based Implementation of Signal Processing Systems is an important reference for practising engineers and researchers working on the design and development of DSP systems for radio, telecommunication, information, audio-visual and security applications.

But contrary to what many people believe, the best way to develop new skills isn't working on your weaknesses—it's identifying and elevating the underdeveloped abilities that lie between your weaknesses and your strengths.\n\nBooks like StrengthsFinder 2.0 have helped leaders build on what they're best at—but they stop there. If you only go that far you're missing a huge opportunity for professional growth. Leading Silicon Valley consultants Thuy and Milo Sindell argue that relying exclusively on your top abilities can actually hold you back—it's critical that you expand your repertoire of skills. The most effective way to do that is find your hidden strengths—midlevel skills that can quickly be elevated into learned strengths with attention and focus. This book shows you how.\n\nToo many people waste their time working on their weaknesses, say the Sindells. Although focusing on shoring up weaknesses on the surface makes sense, they've found that it takes too much time and effort—the ROI just isn't there. The neglected skills in the middle, neither strengths nor weaknesses, are where the most potent development opportunities lie. They're close enough to being strengths that putting your energy there can offer a fast and powerful payoff.

However, because of the introduction of computer engineering courses into already-crowded four-year undergraduate programs, the transmission line courses in many electrical engineering programs have been relegated to a senior technical elective, if offered at all.\n\nNow, Analysis of Multiconductor Transmission Lines, Second Edition has been significantly updated and reorganized to fill the need for a structured course on transmission lines in a senior undergraduate- or graduate-level electrical engineering program. In this new edition, each broad analysis topic, e.g., per-unit-length parameters, frequency-domain analysis, time-domain analysis, and incident field excitation, now has a chapter concerning two-conductor lines followed immediately by a chapter on MTLs for that topic. This enables instructors to emphasize two-conductor lines or MTLs or both.\n\nIn addition to the reorganization of the material, this Second Edition now contains important advancements in analysis methods that have developed since the previous edition, such as methods for achieving signal integrity (SI) in high-speed digital interconnects, the finite-difference, time-domain (FDTD) solution methods, and the time-domain to frequency-domain transformation (TDFD) method. Furthermore, the content of Chapters 8 and 9 on digital signal propagation and signal integrity application has been considerably expanded upon to reflect all of the vital information current and future designers of high-speed digital systems need to know.\n\nComplete with an accompanying FTP site, appendices with descriptions of numerous FORTRAN computer codes that implement all the techniques in the text, and a brief but thorough tutorial on the SPICE/PSPICE circuit analysis program, Analysis of Multiconductor Transmission Lines, Second Edition is an indispensable textbook for students and a valuable resource for industry professionals.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Engineering","Electrical Engineering","Signal Processing"]},{"id":"9781482237641","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Optical Multi-Bound Solitons","authors":["Le Nguyen Binh"],"pages":"567","publication_date":"September 2018","description":"This book describes the generation and transmission of multi-bound solitons with the potential to form the basis of the temporal coding of optical data packets for next-generation nonlinear optical systems.

Finally, a creative summarization mechanism is proposed as an effort toward the creative summarization of things, which is an open process of interactions among physical objects, data, people, and systems in cyber-physical-social space through a multi-dimensional lens of semantic computing. The author’s insights can inspire research and development of many computing areas.\n\nThe first book that proposes the method for the summarization of things in cyber-physical society through a multi-dimensional lens of semantic computing.\nA transformation from the traditional application-driven research paradigm into a data-driven research paradigm for creative summarization through information modeling, cognitive modeling and knowledge modeling.\nA multi-dimensional methodology for studying, managing, creating and applying methods.","tags":["Software Development","Software Architecture","Distributed Systems"]},{"id":"9781466514256","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Sustainability","authors":["Tina Agustiady","Adedeji B.

Freedom to Change releases you from the trap of constantly telling yourself that you'd be more successful at teaching, leading, or contributing to an organization if only others didn't stand in your way. In his engaging, irreverent style, bestselling author Michael Fullan explores the two kinds of freedom in our daily lives: freedom from obstacles versus freedom to take initiative and act. Gaining freedom from barriers has no value in itself until it is partnered with an equally determined sense of what you truly want. What change would you like to bring about for yourself or those around you?\n\nGiven that human nature and productivity are fundamentally social, Fullan prescribes four dynamically interrelated actions we can take:\n\nConsciously seeking a balance between our own autonomy and cooperation with others\n\nImproving the feedback exchange—giving more valuable responses, as well as eliciting, hearing, and accepting feedback more effectively\n\nBuilding accountability to others into the fabric of our working lives\n\nFinding ways to influence others with the changes we've made and want to spread\n\nIllustrated and enriched with examples from education, business, and nonprofit sectors, Freedom to Change offers recommendations for both individuals and organizations seeking to enhance connectedness and independence.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Development"]},{"id":"9781119794202","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Two Headed Coin","authors":["James L.

Dochartaigh has produced a survival manual that assists and guides the reader on how best to navigate corporate pitfalls and avoid being ‘trapped’.\n\nThe book fuses three separate but intertwined disciplines of the animal kingdom, the guerrilla battlefield, and the corporate world to help establish patterns of behavior and to understand the motivations that drive each action. All three areas share a common environment: the jungle, where visibility is limited, and ambush is the only method of attack by predators. The book blends animal and human psychology and provides safe passage in all its encounters.\n\nThis book does not condone war—in fact, quite the opposite—and, as you will see, it takes more of a defensive position in repelling attacks and seeks to promote the occurrence of collaboration over individual competition, which will also become apparent. It is not a “call to arms” or a promotion of anarchy—not by any stretch of the imagination—as it merely assists the individual in adapting within their environment in order to ensure their survival.\n\nWhether you work as an accountant, IT consultant, lawyer, salesperson, or project manager, the same logic still applies because there is a natural order in all corporate vocations.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Development"]},{"id":"9780749473709","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Social Media Recruitment","authors":["Andy Headworth"],"pages":"224","publication_date":"May 2015","description":"Devise and implement a social media recruitment strategy to meet your company's recruitment objectives.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Marketing","Digital Marketing","Social Media Marketing"]},{"id":"9780132918022","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Social Trade Show: Leveraging Social Media and Virtual Events to Connect With Your Customers","authors":["Traci Browne"],"pages":"320","publication_date":"June 2012","description":"Today's new social and virtual platforms and technologies can help you transform the way you market through tradeshows, exhibits, and events - helping you supercharge performance on every metric that matters to you.

The malicious purpose could be fraud, theft, espionage, or malware injection. The processes by which email execute the malicious activity vary widely, from fully manual (e.g. human-directed) to fully automated. One example of a malicious email is one that contains an attachment which the recipient is directed to open. When the attachment is opened, malicious software is installed on the recipient’s computer. Because malicious email can vary so broadly in form and function, automated detection is only marginally helpful.

Pinpoint and close vulnerabilities using effective computer forensics!\n\nThe primary purpose of computer forensics is to enable organisations to pinpoint where the malware has infected their computer systems and which files have been infected, so that they can close the vulnerability. More and more organisations have realised that they need to acquire a forensic capability to ensure they are ready to cope with an information security incident.\n\nThis pocket guide illustrates the technical complexities involved in computer forensics, and shows managers what makes the discipline relevant to their organisation. For technical staff, the book offers an invaluable insight into the key processes and procedures that are required.\n\nBenefits to business include:\nDefend your company effectively against attacks By developing a computer forensic capability, your organisation will be better prepared to defend itself in the event of a cyber attack. Surveys of the threat landscape have indicated a significant upswing of insider activity. Forensics within the organisation can be used to identify possible insider misuse of systems or information. In addition, this pocket guide looks at how you can optimise your IT infrastructure so as to enhance the efficiency of incident analysis. This will also minimise the operational impact on your computer systems in the event that a forensic analysis is required.\nBe proactive Being proactive does not just mean making sure your organisation's IT infrastructure is one that can support forensic analysis of incidents. Forensics is now no longer merely a tool to identify what has gone wrong: it can also be used as a mechanism for alerting you to the fact that something has gone wrong. Being proactive therefore implies stepping up your organisation's ability to detect attacks. Detection of attacks is an extremely useful attribute for your organisation to have: the sooner you know about the problem, the sooner you can begin to deal with it.\nSecure evidence that will stand up in court Undertaking forensics is not a simple task. It is not always possible to understand the true consequences of insider misuse until after completion of the investigation. Once the extent of the damage becomes clear, you may want to exercise the option of taking legal action against the perpetrator. This means that it is essential for you to follow correct procedure, so as to safeguard any evidence gathered. This book explains the key steps you need to take to maintain the integrity of the investigation and preserve the evidence.\nCounter encryption Encryption is a double-edged sword. Encryption has a legitimate purpose as a tool deployed by information security professionals. However, the opportunity to conceal data has obvious attractions for the criminal, meaning that encryption is also a technique widely used by hackers. This book looks at how encryption is used to impede a forensic investigation, and examines ways of solving the problem. The most effective tactic for countering encryption is to locate the key material and crack the password that protects it, using a password cracker such as Cain & Abel.\n\nTools, techniques and procedures\n\nThe underground economy makes millions of pounds a year from cybercrime. Because no system or network can be completely secure, any sensible organisation will have mechanisms in place in advance to deal with the consequences of a cyber attack. Digital forensics assists companies and public sector organisations to identify how and where their computer systems have been abused.\n\nThe purpose of this pocket guide is to provide an introduction to the tools, techniques and procedures utilised within computer forensics.

It provides unique opportunities for innovation, enabling the designer to customise the software around their own predilections and modes of working. It liberates the designer by automating many routine aspects and repetitive activities of the design process, freeing-up the designer to spend more time on design thinking. Software that is modified through scripting offers a range of speculations that are not possible using the software only as the manufacturers intended it to be used. There are also significant economic benefits to automating routines and coupling them with emerging digital fabrication technologies, as time is saved at the front-end and new file-to-factory protocols can be taken advantage of. Most significantly perhaps, scripting as a computing program overlay enables the tool user (designer) to become the new tool maker (software engineer). Though scripting is not new to design, it is only recently that it has started to be regarded as integral to the designer's skill set rather than a technical speciality. Many designers are now aware of its potential, but remain hesitant. This book treats scripting not only as a technical challenge, requiring clear description, guidance and training, but also, and more crucially, answers the question as to why designers should script in the first place, and what the cultural and theoretical implications are.\n\nThis book:\n\nInvestigates the application of scripting for productivity, experimentation and design speculation.\n\nOffers detailed exploration of the scripting of Gaudí's final realised design for the Sagrada Família, leading to file-to-factory digital fabrication.\n\nFeatures projects and commentary from over 30 contemporary scripting leaders, including Evan Douglis, Marc Fornes, Sawako Kaijima, Achim Menges, Neri Oxman, Casey Reas and Hugh Whitehead of Foster + Partners.","tags":["Software Development","Operating Systems","Unix","Shell Scripting"]},{"id":"9780470623978","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"The Social Media Bible: Tactics, Tools, and Strategies for Business Success, Second Edition","authors":["Lon Safko"],"pages":"792","publication_date":"September 2010","description":"The bestselling bible for social media is now completely revised and updated!\n\nThe Social Media Bible, Second Edition (www.TSMB2.com) is the most comprehensive resource that transforms the way corporate, small business, and non-profit companies use social media to reach their desired audiences with power messages and efficiency.

More than half of us will die from complex diseases that trace directly to those vulnerabilities, and the modern world we’ve created places us at unprecedented risk from them. In It Takes a Genome, Greg Gibson posits a revolutionary new hypothesis: Our genome is out of equilibrium, both with itself and its environment. Simply put, our genes aren’t coping well with modern culture. Our bodies were never designed to subsist on fat and sugary foods; our immune systems weren’t designed for today’s clean, bland environments; our minds weren’t designed to process hard-edged, artificial electronic inputs from dawn ‘til midnight. And that’s why so many of us suffer from chronic diseases that barely touched our ancestors.\n\nGibson begins by revealing the stunningly complex ways in which multiple genes cooperate and interact to shape our bodies and influence our behaviors. Then, drawing on the very latest science, he explains the genetic “mismatches” that increasingly lead to cancer, diabetes, inflammatory and infectious diseases, AIDS, depression, and senility. He concludes with a look at the probable genetic variations in human psychology, sharing the evidence that traits like introversion and agreeableness are grounded in equally complex genetic interactions.\n\nIt Takes A Genome demolishes yesterday’s stale debates over “nature vs. nurture,” introducing a new view that is far more intriguing, and far closer to the truth.  \n\n    See how broken genes cause cancer Meet the body’s “genetic repairmen”—and understand what happens when they fail\n\nThe growing price of the modern lifestyle Why one-third of all Westerners have obesity, Type 2 diabetes, or other signs of “metabolic syndrome”\n\nThe Alzheimer’s generation Why some of us are predisposed to dementia\n\nWhat’s really normal: the deepest lessons of the human genome The remarkable diversity of physical and emotional “normality”","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Science","Biology","Genomics"]},{"id":"9780429814105","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Philanthropy and the Future of Science and Technology","authors":["Evan S.

Chained exploits are far more complex and far more difficult to defend. Few security or hacking books cover them well and most don’t cover them at all. Now there’s a book that brings together start-to-finish information about today’s most widespread chained exploits–both how to perform them and how to prevent them.\n\nChained Exploits demonstrates this advanced hacking attack technique through detailed examples that reflect real-world attack strategies, use today’s most common attack tools, and focus on actual high-value targets, including credit card and healthcare data. Relentlessly thorough and realistic, this book covers the full spectrum of attack avenues, from wireless networks to physical access and social engineering.\n\nWriting for security, network, and other IT professionals, the authors take you through each attack, one step at a time, and then introduce today’s most effective countermeasures— both technical and human. Coverage includes:\n\nConstructing convincing new phishing attacks\n\nDiscovering which sites other Web users are visiting\n\nWreaking havoc on IT security via wireless networks\n\nDisrupting competitors’ Web sites\n\nPerforming–and preventing–corporate espionage\n\nDestroying secure files\n\nGaining access to private healthcare records\n\nAttacking the viewers of social networking pages\n\nCreating entirely new exploits\n\nand more\n\nAndrew Whitaker, Director of Enterprise InfoSec and Networking for Training Camp, has been featured in The Wall Street Journal and BusinessWeek.

But you're not likely to find the word easy. Even seasoned sendmail pros are sometimes frustrated by the intricacies of sendmail's configuration files. With a little determination and the help of a good reference book, like sendmail, Third Edition, you can master this demanding program. But when there's a significant point release, like sendmail V8.13, where do you turn? An excellent companion to our popular sendmail, Third Edition, the sendmail 8.13 Companion provides a timely way to document the improvements in V8.13 in parallel with its release. The book highlights the important changes in the latest update to sendmail, pointing out not just what is handy or nice to have, but what's critical in getting the best behavior from sendmail. This is especially important now that spam is on the rise, and because mobile technology requires roving laptops to use encrypted connections. Not surprisingly, many of the changes and additions to V8.13 have been driven by the ongoing fight against spam. Anyone concerned about spam--and who isn't?--will benefit greatly by upgrading to V8.13 sendmail. Among its many enhancements, V8.13 includes new routines that support the SPF sending site authentication standard (in the Milter library), simultaneous connection control, high connection rate control, and finer tuning of SASL parameters. The additions to the Milter library, alone, make upgrading worthwhile, but sendmail's connection control makes it a no-brainer. The key to understanding them is the sendmail 8.13 Companion. The book is divided into twenty-five chapters that parallel the chapters in the third edition of the sendmail book. For instance, if you're interested in Options configuration (Chapter 24 in sendmail), you'll turn to Chapter 24 in your companion volume to find out what's new in V8.13. For a simple dot release (8.12 to 8.13), V8.13 sendmail has added more features, options, and fundamental changes than any other single dot release has included. If you need to set up or manage sendmail, you'll want this companion volume close at hand. Even if you aren't ready to upgrade to V8.13, you'll find the key to understanding them is the sendmail 8.13 Companion a useful guide to understanding and staying current with the latest changes in sendmail.","tags":["IT Operations","Service Administration","Email Servers","Sendmail"]},{"id":"9781597499514","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Hacking Web Apps","authors":["Mike Shema"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"October 2012","description":"How can an information security professional keep up with all of the hacks, attacks, and exploits on the Web?

It addresses both private and public funding sources available in the US and internationally. The biopharmaceutical market is among the most research-intensive market sectors globally. Clinical researchers face a multitude of public and private funding options with respect to bringing their idea or innovation to market. These funding options are continually changing and complex, and are expected to decrease in the near future. A lack of understanding of the scale, scope, and inner workings of the funding aspects of R&D can, at times, act as a barrier for all involved, and can slow down or even eliminate the R&D process. The book lessens these barriers by describing the theoretical underpinnings, present practice, and trends in R&D funding in this market sector, both in the US and internationally. This includes a review and discussion of public-private partnership activity and their inner-workings, noting the complementary relationship between public and private funding. The book also contains an overview of the inner-workings of strategic alliance activity, including the advantages and disadvantages for each party. It goes on to provide an outline of venture capital activity, detailing the methods by which venture capital firms raise capital and are organized, a description of the venture capital-entrepreneur arrangement, and the effects of this arrangement.

In fact, we all have occasion to apologize. But we don't need more apologies, says John Kador. We need more effective ones that restore strained relationships, create possibilities for growth, and generate better outcomes for all. Effective Apology challenges you to think about the fundamental value of an apology, to you and the receiver, as it explores in detail the key dimensions—what Kador calls the Five Rs—of a wholehearted apology, one that heals and renews. Kador also offers advice on how to accept or reject an apology, ten apology dos and don'ts, and a quiz to test your Apology Quotient. The willingness to apologize signals strength, character, and integrity—real leadership is impossible without it. With over 70 examples of the good, the bad, and the ineffective apology in action, no other book combines such a practical, how-to approach with a rich analysis of what it takes to make apology work in the real world.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Communication"]},{"id":"0131453580","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Winning Habits: 4 Secrets that Will Change the Rest of Your Life","authors":["Dick Lyles"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"January 2004","description":"4 Simple Secrets of Success...Make Them Work for You!“In Winning Ways, Dick Lyles showed us how to work well with people.

Rather than feel helpless in the face of oppression, world-renowned activist, performance poet, and author Sonya Renee Taylor teaches us how to turn to the power of radical self-love in her new book, The Body Is Not an Apology. Radical self-love is the guiding framework that transforms the learned self-hatred of our bodies and the prejudices we have about other people's bodies into a vision of compassion, equity, and justice. In a revolutionary departure from the corporate self-help and body-positivity movement, Taylor forges the inextricable bond between radical self-love and social justice. The first step is recognizing that we have all been indoctrinated into a system of body shame that profits off of our self-hatred. When we ask ourselves, “Who benefits from our collective shame?” we can begin to make the distinction between the messages we are receiving about our bodies or other bodies and the truth. This book moves us beyond our all-too-often hidden lives, where we are easily encouraged to forget that we are whole humans having whole human experiences in our bodies alongside others. Radical self-love encourages us to embark on a personal journey of transformation with thoughtful reflection on the origins of our minds and bodies as a source of strength. In doing this, we not only learn to reject negative messages about ourselves but begin to thwart the very power structures that uphold them. Systems of oppression thrive off of our inability to make peace with bodies and difference. Radical self-love not only dismantles shame and self-loathing in us but has the power to dismantle global systems of injustice—because when we make peace with our bodies, only then do we have the capacity to truly make peace with the bodies of others.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Development","Confidence / Motivation"]},{"id":"9781926895321","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Advanced Process Control and Simulation for Chemical Engineers","authors":["Hossein Ghanadzadeh Gilani","Katia Ghanadzadeh Samper","Reza Khodaparast Haghi"],"pages":"224","publication_date":"April 2016","description":"This book offers a modern view of process control in the context of today’s technology.

Providing both an historical and a business-minded context, this extensive resource describes the unique scientific and engineering techniques used to create these beautiful, clever, and eminently useful devices.\n\nIn this book, the history of the science and technology behind the LCD is described in a prelude to the development of the device, presenting a rational development theme and pinpointing innovations. The book begins with Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism, and the ultimately profound realization that light is an electromagnetic wave and an electromagnetic wave is light.\n\nThe power of mathematical physics thus was brought to bear upon the study of light, and particularly the polarization of light by material bodies, including liquid crystals. After a brief historical description of polarization, a physical interpretation provides substance to the mathematical concepts. Subsequent chapters cover:\n\nThermodynamics for liquid crystals\n\nThe Maier-Saupe mean field, phenomenological, static continuum, and dynamic continuum theories\n\nThe transistor and integrated circuit\n\nGlass, panels, and modules\n\nThe calculus of variations\n\nThe active matrix\n\nSemiconductor fabrication\n\nThe global LCD business\n\nAdditionally, the book illustrates how mathematics, physics, and chemistry are put to practical use in the LCDs we use every day. By describing the science from an historical perspective and in practical terms in the context of a device very familiar to readers, the book presents an engaging and unique view of the technology for everyone from science students to engineers, product designers, and indeed anyone curious about LCDs.\n\nSeries Editor: Anthony C. Lowe, The Lambent Consultancy, Braishfield, UK\n\nThe Society for Information Display (SID) is an international society, which has the aim of encouraging the development of all aspects of the field of information display. Complementary to the aims of the society, the Wiley-SID series is intended to explain the latest developments in information display technology at a professional level. The broad scope of the series addresses all facets of information displays from technical aspects through systems and prototypes to standards and ergonomics.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Science","Physics"]},{"id":"9781786467577","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Python Programming with Raspberry Pi","authors":["Srihari Yamanoor","Sai Yamanoor"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"April 2017","description":"Learn how to harness the power of Python programming to develop innovative projects with the Raspberry Pi Zero.

By replacing locally managed stacks of networking, hardware, and software resources with an Internet-based utility, this model has changed how business applications are delivered, bringing new levels of ease, adoption, and success to the challenging area of enterprise software. And just as the evolution of the Internet affects almost all industries, the evolution of the on-demand model promises to change enterprise technology and to offer new opportunities for IT productivity and impact. Perhaps the most important new area of on-demand computing is the introduction of a complete application development platform, capable of supporting virtually all business application requirements—as a service. This Platform as a Service (PaaS) model extends the benefits of the on-demand model to custom application development. It’s an approach that promises to change application development as much as SaaS already changed application delivery. Introduced in 2007, Force.com is salesforce.com’s platform-as-a-service offering. By using Force.com, companies and ISVs can create and run new applications entirely over the Internet, without software. Capable of supporting all kinds of business applications—not just those for the sales, marketing and support departments— Force.com makes the core technologies behind Salesforce CRM available for developing applications that serve all of a company’s departments, employees, and customers. With Force.com, companies are freed from the burdens of implementing and managing their IT infrastructures for custom applications, and can instead focus their resources on those activities that provide the most business impact. With an estimated eight of every ten dollars spent in “dead money” that doesn’t contribute directly to business change and growth, the PaaS model provides immediate benefits to IT and development organizations of all sizes. And, similar to the utility services provided by power or telephone companies, organizations pay only for those services they successfully deploy and use. As a result, they can eliminate much of the risk that accompanies traditional software-based development platforms.* With Force.com, companies can finally focus on innovation, not infrastructure.","tags":["IT Operations","Cloud Computing","Cloud Architecture","Cloud Services","Software as a Service (SaaS)"]},{"id":"9780857086082","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Top Dog: Impress and Influence Everyone You Meet","authors":["Richard Ruttle","Andy Bounds"],"pages":"176","publication_date":"March 2015","description":"Get the results you want and come out as the Top Dog in every conversation\n\nFancy being the 'Top Dog' in all your dealings?

But the truth for all of them is, yes, they can \"do that\" -- and they’d better. \"That\" means managing employees as proactively and decisively as their corporate counterparts, and holding their staffs, teams, and departments accountable for productivity and results. Managing Government Employees offers dozens of techniques for meeting the challenges and stressful situations supervisers face on a daily basis. Major topics include how to:\n\n* get maximum dedication and productivity from employees* improve results of poor performers and discipline or fire them when necessary* deal with union and EEO issues* cut through the red tape of government employment systems\n\nFor managers frustrated by government bureaucracy, this book lets them know they have more power than they may think.","tags":["Security","Governance, Risk Management and Compliance (GRC)","Governance"]},{"id":"9780123694669","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Value at Risk and Bank Capital Management","authors":["Francesco Saita"],"pages":"280","publication_date":"February 2007","description":"While the highly technical measurement techniques and methodologies of Value at Risk have attracted huge interest, much less attention has been focused on how Value at Risk and the risk-adjusted performance measures such as RAROC or economic profit/EVA„· can be effectively used to improve a bank¡¦s decision making processes. Academic books are typically concerned primarily with measurement techniques, and devote only a small section to describing the applications, usually without discussing the problems that changing organizational processes in banks may have on business units¡¦ behaviour. Practitioners¡¦ books are often based on a single experience, presenting the approach that has been pursued by a single bank, but often do not adequately evaluate that approach. In actual practice, the choice of how to use Value at Risk and risk-adjusted performance measures has no single optimal solution, but requires effective decision making that can identify the solution that is consistent with the bank¡¦s style of management and coordination mechanisms, and often with characteristics of individual business units as well. In this book, Francesco Saita of Bocconi University argues that even though risk measurement techniques have greatly improved in recent years for market, credit and now also operational risk, capital management and capital allocation decisions are far from becoming purely technical and mechanical. On one hand, decisions about capital management must consider handling different capital constraints (e.g. regulatory vs. economic capital ) and face remarkable difficulties in providing a measure of ¡§aggregated¡¨ Value at Risk (i.e. a measure that considers the overall value at risk of the bank after diversification across risk types). On the other hand, the aim of using capital more efficiently through capital allocation cannot be achieved only through a sort of centralized asset allocation process, but rather by designing a Value at Risk limit system and a risk-adjusted performance measurement system that are designed to provide the right incentives to individual business units. This connection between sophisticated and cutting edge risk measurement techniques and practical bank decision making about capital management and capital allocation make this book unique and provide readers with a depth of academic and theoretical expertise combined with practical and real-world understanding of bank structure, organizational constraints, and decisionmaking processes.*Contains concise, expert analysis of the latest technical VaR measures but without the highly mathematical component of other books*Discusses practical applications of these measures in the real world of banking, focusing on effective decision making for capital management and allocation*Author is based at Bocconi University in Milan, Italy, one of the foremost institutions for banking in Europe","tags":["Security","Governance, Risk Management and Compliance (GRC)","Operational Risk"]},{"id":"9780132678711","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Outsmarting Google®: SEO Secrets to Winning New Business","authors":["Evan Bailyn","Bradley Bailyn"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"March 2011","description":"Never-before-revealed tactics for optimizing your web site for Google, from one of the world's most remarkable Google search experts\n\nBy a legendary SEO expert who attracted nearly 70,000,000 visitors to his own web properties last year, using only SEO and related organic tactics\n\nBrand-new tactics that work, not outdated approaches or SEO myths\n\nPacked with never-before-published case studies from the author's work with 200+ clients - from Mom and Pop businesses to enterprises to celebrities\n\nWith 65% of the Internet search market, Google plays an enormous role in global commerce, determining which sites will receive traffic and which won't.

It's true that all leaders--no matter how seasoned--need guidance through the professional changes that define a career. In fact, transitions into new roles are the crucibles in which leaders get their toughest tests, and they're the defining factor in professional careers today. Yet far too often, leaders fail to transition effectively into new roles. The resulting costs are high, for individual careers and for organizations. In Your Next Move, leadership-transition guru Watkins shows how you can survive and thrive in all the major transitions you will face during your career-including promotions, leading former peers, on-boarding into a new organization, making an international move, or turning around or realigning an organization. With real-life examples and case studies, Watkins illustrates the defining hurdles associated with each type of transition. He then provides the insights, strategies, and tools you'll need to accelerate through these crucial turning points and continue moving up in your career. The necessary complement to the author's bestselling guide The First 90 Days, which has been translated in more than 20 languages worldwide, Your Next Move offers the keen observations, tried-and-true management wisdom, and practical good sense Watkins is renowned for. It's a vital resource for any manager or executive seeking to maintain career momentum. To quote the reviewer from above: \"It's not just about \"moving\" but about what happens when those actions are taken. Success or failure are the two options, and which option you emerge with will determine what happens going forward.

Drawing on research conducted in collaboration with the French Institute for Radiological Protection and Nuclear Safety (IRSN), the ideas that are put forward rely on a review of the practices of specialists in human and organizational factors concerning nuclear safety. The author shows that the French approach depends on maintaining a technical dialogue between the regulatory authority (ASN), IRSN and nuclear operators. This method of risk management is known as \"French cooking\" in the Anglo-Saxon world, where a more formal regulatory approach is taken. This technical dialogue does however hold certain benefits, particularly in the field of human and organizational factors, where it allows an advancement of the state of knowledge, which remains incomplete. After the Fukushima accident, in the face of an ongoing European and global re-evaluation of the safety of nuclear power and alignment towards the Anglo-Saxon standard, the French cooking approach may yet be able to make a significant contribution. This work will be of interest to all involved in nuclear power engineering and in the field of risk management and nuclear safety.\n\nIncludes a preface by Jacques Repussard, Director General, IRSN, France, and a postface by Erik Hollnagel, Professor, Institute of Regional Health Research, University of Southern Denmark / Chief Consultant, Centre for Quality, Region of Southern Denmark.","tags":["Security","Governance, Risk Management and Compliance (GRC)","Operational Risk"]},{"id":"9780071806152","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Tuesday Morning Coaching: Eight Simple Truths to Boost Your Career and Your Life","authors":["David Cottrell"],"pages":"160","publication_date":"November 2012","description":"From the author of the bestselling Monday Morning series--an instructive, inspiring story on rebooting your life and career with the power of simple truths\n\nRyan Harris has been floundering for too long.

Donahue outlines six \"rules of desert travel\" that will help us discover our direction by wandering, find our own personal oases, and cross our self-imposed borders.\"The sun appears like a silent explosion, a slow motion fireworks display dazzling the volcanic crags of the Hoggar. I stand up and walk to the path and begin descending to Klaus' car. I've made my decision. Tallis and I will travel, somehow, to Agadez. I don't have a logical explanation for my decision or a plan to get to the last oasis. I know I am on the right journey-I am following my compass.\"Shifting Sands shows us how to slow down, reflect, and embrace the changes of life graciously, naturally, and courageously.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Development"]},{"id":"9781953349835","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"The Champion Edge","authors":["Dr. Alan R.

We know this because they’ve actively listed one or more of these things as interests under their real names right next to their profile photo.\n\nUnfortunately, the amount of people who hope to turn their creativity into a professional career wildly outnumber the very select few who actually end up doing so. Why is that? Are they lazy? Uninformed? Uninspired?\n\nIn reality, it’s none of the above. The biggest reasons many amazingly gifted people never pursue a career in creativity are because they don’t know where to start or how to do so.\n\nProfessional creativity has always been a bit of an enigma to those who seek it. The average person believes every artist is a starving one, while the average artist will tell you there is an impenetrable wall between commerce and art.\n\n¿\n\nNeither of these statements is true, and the end result of all this misinformation is that many incredibly talented people don’t realize that there are others like them out in the world making a (rather good) living by doing something they love.\n\nThis book provides a comprehensive list of creative jobs in advertising, career best practices, and advice from experts in their field, helping talented creative people:\n\nUnderstand the vast universe of creative occupations in advertising\n\nChoose which career path to follow\n\nMaster the social and business politics of the creative world\n\nLearn the truth about the Advertising industry (the good, the bad, and the ugly) from people who are already making money doing it\n\nThere are many books about teaching people how to be creative or how to find their inner creativity. This is not one of those books.\n\nCreativity isn’t something you can actually teach. You either have it, or you don’t.\n\nThis book is for those who have it. You’ve heard how ridiculously talented you are your whole life. People already crave your work and envy your skills. Friends ask you for favors. “A+” is the baseline for your art. Your work has graced the front of refrigerators, dorm rooms, and cubicles for years.\n\nThis book is for you–the rock stars, juggernauts, and creative beasts who know you’re talented, but don’t know how to use your skills to attain and maintain a career. Whether you want a solo career, your own business, a position at a well-known company, or a promotion from within, this book will be your guide.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Marketing","Digital Marketing","Social Media Marketing"]},{"id":"9780132658348","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"How to Avoid Being Scammed","authors":["Steve Weisman"],"pages":"15","publication_date":"November 2010","description":"This Element is an excerpt from The Truth About Avoiding Scams (9780132333856) by Steve Weisman.

The authors demonstrate various aspects of smart corrosion management and persuasively make the case that there is a real difference between corrosion management and corrosion knowledge management.\n\nThe book contains seven chapters that each focuses on one important aspect of corrosion and corrosion management.\n\nCorrosion management is an issue that is not just corrosion science or corrosion engineering but rather a combination of both elements. To cover this paradoxical aspect of corrosion management, chapter 2 deals with some basic, introductory concepts and principles of corrosion and coating/painting (an important corrosion protection method) while chapter 3 explains the elements of smart corrosion management in detail. Another important principle of smart corrosion management is to be able to study the cost of corrosion, chapter 4 introduces important points in the economics involved in a smart corrosion management. As indicated earlier, corrosion engineering is also an integral part of corrosion management and thus chapter 5 looks at the engineering side of corrosion by detailing the example of Process Additives (EMPA). Chapter 6 for the first time looks at the possibility of using TRIZ (algorithm of invention) in corrosion management. Finally, chapter 7 presents the necessary elements for building a model that would explore the mutual interaction between corrosion and environment mainly by exploring the difference between environmental impact and environmental effect. Chapter 7 is also very important because the four models so far applied to estimate the cost of corrosion (Uhlig Method, Hoar Method, I/O method and LCC method) are not capable of suggesting any clear model or a sensible way of exploring the elements necessary to explain the impact of indirect costs of corrosion the most important of which being environmental damages imposed by corrosion.\n\nThis book is ideal for engineers, students, and managers working or studying corrosion, Corrosion Policy Decision Making is also an indispensable resource for professionals in the fields of upstream and downstream, on-shore/off-shore oil and gas, transportation, mining, power generation as well as major sectors of other strategic industries.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Science","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering"]},{"id":"9780132763813","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Moving from Brevity to Aha! in Your Presentation","authors":["Jerry Weissman"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"February 2011","description":"This Element is an excerpt from Presentations in Action (9780132489621) by Jerry Weissman.

Change occurs all at once, on a large scale, and often in response to crisis. Yet we know from a great deal of experience that Big Bang transformation attempts often fail, fostering employee discontent and producing mediocre solutions with little lasting impact.Instead of undertaking a risky, large-scale makeover, organizations can seed transformation by collectively uncovering “everyday disconnects” — the disparities between our expectations about how work is carried out and how it is actually is. The discovery of such disconnects encourages people to think about how the work might be done differently. Continuously pursuing these smaller-scale changes — and then weaving them together — offers a practical middle path between large-scale transformation and smallscale pilot projects that run the risk of producing too little too late.The author has found that organizations take three approaches to discovery that are both particularly effective for uncovering everyday disconnects in the organization’s work and seeding transformation from the bottom up. These techniques can be used together. The three techniques are:1. Work Discovery Instead of assuming that you know how work is designed, examine it firsthand as it is actually conducted. Determine how to turn the (inevitable) surprises you uncover into assets.2. Better Practices Instead of simply adopting the best practices of other organizations, screen the way work gets done in your organization through those best practices to generate new ideas. In other words, use best practices to generate even better practices.3. Test Training Instead of locking down standard operating procedures during training, experiment with other, potentially better possibilities for changing the way the work will get done. Use training for testing these possibilities.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Communication","Collaboration"]},{"id":"53863MIT59301","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Why the Influence of Women on Boards Still Lags","authors":["Kimberly Whitler","Deborah Henretta","Susan Fournier"],"pages":"3","publication_date":"April 2018","description":"Research indicates that the reason women aren't making more rapid inroads on corporate boards is that few have reached the most influential board leadership positions.

All of this has led to growing interest in “corporate social responsibility,” or “CSR,” which has been described as the way that firms integrate social, environmental, and economic concerns into their values, culture, decision making, strategy, and operations in a transparent and accountable manner and thereby establish better practices within the firm, create wealth, and improve society.\n\nThe commitments and activities associated with any CSR initiative should begin with compliance with laws and regulations promulgated by the governmental entities have jurisdiction over the firm’s activities; however, CSR extends well “beyond the law” to include important subjects as to which the law has not been able to keep. As a result, voluntary corporate responsibility standards developed from a variety of sources have emerged to fill the gap.\n\nThis book serves as an introduction to sustainability standards and instruments and includes chapters on initiatives of governmental and intergovernmental bodies, sectoral CSR commitments, CSR-related reporting and management standards, and securities exchanges and regulators.","tags":["Security","Governance, Risk Management and Compliance (GRC)","Governance"]},{"id":"9781631579615","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Conflict and Leadership","authors":["Christian Muntean"],"pages":"188","publication_date":"April 2018","description":"Conflict is one of the greatest sources of tolerated business expenses and loss.

OOP promotes good design practices, code portability, and reuse–but it requires a shift in thinking to be fully understood. Programmers new to OOP should resist the temptation to jump directly into a particular programming language or a modeling language, and instead first take the time to learn what author Matt Weisfeld calls “the object-oriented thought process.”\n\nWritten by a developer for developers who want to improve their understanding of object-oriented technologies, The Object-Oriented Thought Process provides a solutions-oriented approach to object-oriented programming. Readers will learn to understand the proper uses of inheritance and composition, the difference between aggregation and association, and the important distinction between interfaces and implementations.\n\nWhile programming technologies have been changing and evolving over the years, object-oriented concepts remain a constant–no matter what the platform. This revised edition focuses on the OOP technologies that have survived the past 20 years and remain at its core, with new and expanded coverage of design patterns, avoiding dependencies, and the SOLID principles to help make software designs understandable, flexible, and maintainable.\n\n.","tags":["Software Development","Software Architecture","Architectural Patterns","Object-Oriented Architecture"]},{"id":"9798868818141","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Mastering the TOGAF® Standard: A Practical Translation of the World's Leading Architecture Framework","authors":["Eric Jager"],"pages":"879","publication_date":"November 2025","description":"Design, implement, and deploy architectures based on the world's leading architecture framework: The TOGAF Standard.

Companies such as Geico, Dell and eBay are adapting the traditional “one-way” advertising message and using it as a stepping-stone to begin a two-way dialogue with consumers via social media.\n\nMarketers know that theoretically, social media should be a powerful way to generate sustainable, positive word-of-mouth marketing. If marketers can only select the right social media platform, design the right message and engage the right users to spread that message, their campaign should be a success. But until now, that’s been a big if.\n\nThe authors propose a seven-step framework for success in social media marketing campaigns. Their framework involves identifying social media users who are not only influential but also particularly interested in the company’s product or service category and then recruiting and incentivizing those influencers to talk about the company’s product or service. The authors describe the implementation of their seven-step framework at Hokey Pokey Ice Cream Creations, an upscale ice-cream retailer with more than a dozen outlets across India. Hokey Pokey’s social media campaign resulted in substantial increases in brand awareness, social media ROI and sales revenue growth rate for the company. The authors also explain three new metrics they developed for use in social media marketing campaigns: the Customer Influence Effect, which measures the influence a social media user has on other users in the network; the Stickiness Index, which helps identify social media users who actively discuss the company’s product or service category; and Customer Influence Value, which helps measure the monetary gain or loss realized by a company in social marketing campaigns by accounting for an individual’s influence on purchases by other customers and prospects.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Marketing","Digital Marketing","Social Media Marketing"]},{"id":"9780138363635","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Redefining Hacking: A Comprehensive Guide to Red Teaming and Bug Bounty Hunting in an AI-driven World","authors":["Omar Santos","Savannah Lazzara","Wesley Thurner"],"pages":"608","publication_date":"February 2025","description":"Redefining Hacking: A Comprehensive Guide to Red Teaming and Bug Bounty Hunting in an AI-Driven World equips cybersecurity professionals, students, and tech enthusiasts with modern hacking methodologies and the tools to combat evolving threats.

Then check out SSH, the Secure Shell, which provides key-based authentication and transparent encryption for your network connections. It's reliable, robust, and reasonably easy to use, and both free and commercial implementations are widely available for most operating systems. While it doesn't solve every privacy and security problem, SSH eliminates several of them very effectively.Everything you want to know about SSH is in our second edition of SSH, The Secure Shell: The Definitive Guide. This updated book thoroughly covers the latest SSH-2 protocol for system administrators and end users interested in using this increasingly popular TCP/IP-based solution.How does it work? Whenever data is sent to the network, SSH automatically encrypts it. When data reaches its intended recipient, SSH decrypts it. The result is \"transparent\" encryption-users can work normally, unaware that their communications are already encrypted. SSH supports secure file transfer between computers, secure remote logins, and a unique \"tunneling\" capability that adds encryption to otherwise insecure network applications. With SSH, users can freely navigate the Internet, and system administrators can secure their networks or perform remote administration.Written for a wide, technical audience, SSH, The Secure Shell: The Definitive Guide covers several implementations of SSH for different operating systems and computing environments. Whether you're an individual running Linux machines at home, a corporate network administrator with thousands of users, or a PC/Mac owner who just wants a secure way to telnet or transfer files between machines, our indispensable guide has you covered. It starts with simple installation and use of SSH, and works its way to in-depth case studies on large, sensitive computer networks.No matter where or how you're shipping information, SSH, The Secure Shell: The Definitive Guide will show you how to do it securely.","tags":["Security","Network Security","SSH"]},{"id":"9798868800542","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"API Management: An Architect's Guide to Developing and Managing APIs for Your Organization","authors":["Brajesh De"],"pages":"434","publication_date":"December 2023","description":"APIs are the enablers for a thriving ecosystem that can drive revenue growth and ROIs for any organization.

Offering services, conducting transactions and moving data on the Web opens new opportunities, but many CTOs and CIOs are more concerned with the risks. Like the rulers of medieval cities, they've adopted a siege mentality, building walls to keep the bad guys out. It makes for a secure perimeter, but hampers the flow of commerce.\n\nFortunately, some corporations are beginning to rethink how they provide security, so that interactions with customers, employees, partners, and suppliers will be richer and more flexible. Digital Identity explains how to go about it. This book details an important concept known as \"identity management architecture\" (IMA): a method to provide ample protection while giving good guys access to vital information and systems. In today's service-oriented economy, digital identity is everything. IMA is a coherent, enterprise-wide set of standards, policies, certifications and management activities that enable companies like yours to manage digital identity effectively--not just as a security check, but as a way to extend services and pinpoint the needs of customers.\n\nAuthor Phil Windley likens IMA to good city planning. Cities define uses and design standards to ensure that buildings and city services are consistent and workable. Within that context, individual buildings--or system architectures--function as part of the overall plan. With Windley's experience as VP of product development for Excite@Home.com and CIO of Governor Michael Leavitt's administration in Utah, he provides a rich, real-world view of the concepts, issues, and technologies behind identity management architecture.\n\nHow does digital identity increase business opportunity? Windley's favorite example is the ATM machine. With ATMs, banks can now offer around-the-clock service, serve more customers simultaneously, and do it in a variety of new locations. This fascinating book shows CIOs, other IT professionals, product managers, and programmers how security planning can support business goals and opportunities, rather than holding them at bay.","tags":["Security","Identity and Access Management (IAM)"]},{"id":"9781492034421","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Thinking Architecturally","authors":["Nathaniel Schutta"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"June 2018","description":"New software technology appears every year.

However, the UML is a big language, and not all of it is equally important. The award-winning first edition of UML Distilled was widely praised for being a concise guide to the core parts of the UML and has proved extremely successful in helping developers get up and running quickly. UML Distilled, Second Edition, maintains the concise format with significantly updated coverage of use cases and activity diagrams, and expanded coverage of collaborations. It also includes a new appendix detailing the changes between UML versions.\n\nWritten for those with a basic understanding of object-oriented analysis and design, this book begins with a summary of UML's history, development, and rationale and then moves into a discussion of how the UML can be integrated into the object-oriented development process. The primary author profiles the various modeling techniques in the UML--such as use cases, class diagrams, and interaction diagrams--and describes the notation and semantics clearly and succinctly. He also outlines useful non-UML techniques such as CRC cards and patterns. These descriptions are made even more relevant with a collection of best practices based on the primary author's experience and a brief Java programming example demonstrating the implementation of a UML-based design. With this tour of the key parts of the UML, readers will be left with a firm foundation upon which to build models and develop further knowledge of the Unified Modeling Language.\n\nPraise for the First Edition\n\n\"UML Distilled is a recipient of the prestigious 1997 Software Development Magazine Productivity Award in the Books category. Addison-Wesley congratulates authors Martin Fowler and Kendall Scott for their outstanding work.\"\n\n\"This book is a godsend. It is packed with solid advice presented in a concise and highly readable way. The essence of the notations is explained very well indeed but the author goes beyond this to give very clear insights into the application of UML techniques.\" -- Jennifer Stapleton, Vice President Technical, British Computer Society\n\n\"UML Distilled is well written, knowledgeable about both systems development and UML, and disarmingly honest.\" -- Robert L. Glass, The Software Practitioner (March 1998)\n\n\"UML Distilled proves that you can say a lot of useful things about computing in a small book.\" -- Gregory V.

Windley"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"August 2005","description":"The rise of network-based, automated services in the past decade has definitely changed the way businesses operate, but not always for the better. Offering services, conducting transactions and moving data on the Web opens new opportunities, but many CTOs and CIOs are more concerned with the risks. Like the rulers of medieval cities, they've adopted a siege mentality, building walls to keep the bad guys out. It makes for a secure perimeter, but hampers the flow of commerce.\n\nFortunately, some corporations are beginning to rethink how they provide security, so that interactions with customers, employees, partners, and suppliers will be richer and more flexible. Digital Identity explains how to go about it. This book details an important concept known as \"identity management architecture\" (IMA): a method to provide ample protection while giving good guys access to vital information and systems. In today's service-oriented economy, digital identity is everything. IMA is a coherent, enterprise-wide set of standards, policies, certifications and management activities that enable companies like yours to manage digital identity effectively--not just as a security check, but as a way to extend services and pinpoint the needs of customers.\n\nAuthor Phil Windley likens IMA to good city planning. Cities define uses and design standards to ensure that buildings and city services are consistent and workable. Within that context, individual buildings--or system architectures--function as part of the overall plan. With Windley's experience as VP of product development for Excite@Home.com and CIO of Governor Michael Leavitt's administration in Utah, he provides a rich, real-world view of the concepts, issues, and technologies behind identity management architecture.\n\nHow does digital identity increase business opportunity? Windley's favorite example is the ATM machine. With ATMs, banks can now offer around-the-clock service, serve more customers simultaneously, and do it in a variety of new locations. This fascinating book shows CIOs, other IT professionals, product managers, and programmers how security planning can support business goals and opportunities, rather than holding them at bay.","tags":["Security","Identity and Access Management (IAM)"]},{"id":"9781625278142","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"HBR's 10 Must Reads Collection (12 Books)","authors":["Harvard Business Review","Peter F.

McDowall"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"February 2019","description":"Implement successful and cost-effective enterprise architecture projects. This book provides a new approach to developing enterprise architecture based on the idea of emergent behaviors—where instead of micromanaging system implementation, the enterprise architecture effort establishes clear goals and leaves the details to the implementation teams. System development efforts are measured based on their contribution to achieving business goals instead of implementing specific (possibly outdated) requirements.\n\nMost enterprise architecture initiatives employ one of the existing system architecture frameworks such as Zachman or The Open Group Architecture Framework, but these are not well-suited for enterprise architecture in a modern, agile organization. The new approach presented in this book is based on the author’s experience with large enterprise architecture efforts. The approach leverages research into complex adaptive systems and emergent behaviors, where afew simple rules result in complex and efficient enterprise behaviors.\n\nSimplifying the task of establishing and maintaining the enterprise architecture cuts the costs of building and maintaining the architecture and frees up those resources for more productive pursuits. System implementers are given the freedom to rapidly adapt to changing user needs without the blessing of the enterprise modeling priesthood, and the architecture is transformed from a static pile of obscure models and documents into an operational framework that can be actively used to manage an enterprise’s resources to better achieve business goals. The enterprise architect is free to stop focusing on building and maintaining models and start focusing on achieving business goals.\n\n \n\nWhat You’ll Learn\n\nRefocus enterprise architecture on business needs by eliminating most of the enterprise-level models\nDelegate tasks to the development teams who do system implementation\nDocument business goals, establish strategies for achieving those goals, and measure progress toward those goals\nMeasure the results and gauge whether the enterprise architecture is achieving its goals\nUtilize appropriate modeling techniques that can be effectively used in an enterprise architecture\n\nWho This Book Is For\n\nArchitecture practitioners and architecture managers: Practitioners are experienced architects who have used existing frameworks such as Zachman, and have experience with formal architecture modeling and/or model-based system engineering; managers are responsible for managing an enterprise architecture project and either have experience with enterprise architecture projects that were ineffective or are looking for a different approach that will be more cost-effective and allow for more organizational agility. Government program managers looking for a differentapproach to make enterprise architecture more relevant and easier to implement will also find this book of value.","tags":["Software Development","Software Architecture","Enterprise Architecture"]},{"id":"9781119085294","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"How to Measure Anything in Cybersecurity Risk","authors":["Douglas W.

However, the UML is a big language, and not all of it is equally important. The award-winning first edition of UML Distilled was widely praised for being a concise guide to the core parts of the UML and has proved extremely successful in helping developers get up and running quickly. UML Distilled, Second Edition, maintains the concise format with significantly updated coverage of use cases and activity diagrams, and expanded coverage of collaborations. It also includes a new appendix detailing the changes between UML versions.\n\nWritten for those with a basic understanding of object-oriented analysis and design, this book begins with a summary of UML's history, development, and rationale and then moves into a discussion of how the UML can be integrated into the object-oriented development process. The primary author profiles the various modeling techniques in the UML--such as use cases, class diagrams, and interaction diagrams--and describes the notation and semantics clearly and succinctly. He also outlines useful non-UML techniques such as CRC cards and patterns. These descriptions are made even more relevant with a collection of best practices based on the primary author's experience and a brief Java programming example demonstrating the implementation of a UML-based design. With this tour of the key parts of the UML, readers will be left with a firm foundation upon which to build models and develop further knowledge of the Unified Modeling Language.\n\nPraise for the First Edition\n\n\"UML Distilled is a recipient of the prestigious 1997 Software Development Magazine Productivity Award in the Books category. Addison-Wesley congratulates authors Martin Fowler and Kendall Scott for their outstanding work.\"\n\n\"This book is a godsend.

But, particularly today, doing intelligence is mostly about teamwork—the volume, complexity, and global nature of the work demand collaboration across a diversity of people, disciplines, and organizations.And yet teams in the intelligence community face formidable challenges. Needed information may be classified, and ultimate goals are sometimes covert—concealed from the very people working to achieve them. The bureaucracy is immense and complex, and the extraordinary demands of the work lead to high turnover and frequent transfers. But there is also good news. J. Richard Hackman draws on his unparalleled decade of experience as a researcher on and consultant to the intelligence community to show how to create an environment where teamwork flourishes. Hackman identifies six conditions necessary for any team to succeed: setting up a well-defined, stable, interdependent unit; getting the right people on the team; defining a compelling purpose; establishing clear norms of conduct; creating a supportive organizational context; and providing team-focused coaching. He uses concrete examples to show how each of these conditions helps teams accomplish their missions.Although written with intelligence, defense, crisis management, and law enforcement professionals in mind, the book contains lessons that can be applied to any organization—these necessary conditions are universal. Collaborative Intelligence is a vital resource for the intelligence community and a fascinating look inside that community for outsiders.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Communication","Emotional Intelligence"]},{"id":"9781587053320","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"End-to-End Network Security: Defense-in-Depth","authors":["Omar Santos"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"August 2007","description":"End-to-End Network Security\n\nDefense-in-Depth\n\nBest practices for assessing and improving network defenses and responding to security incidents\n\nOmar Santos\n\nInformation security practices have evolved from Internet perimeter protection to an in-depth defense model in which multiple countermeasures are layered throughout the infrastructure to address vulnerabilities and attacks. This is necessary due to increased attack frequency, diverse attack sophistication, and the rapid nature of attack velocity—all blurring the boundaries between the network and perimeter.\n\nEnd-to-End Network Security is designed to counter the new generation of complex threats. Adopting this robust security strategy defends against highly sophisticated attacks that can occur at multiple locations in your network. The ultimate goal is to deploy a set of security capabilities that together create an intelligent, self-defending network that identifies attacks as they occur, generates alerts as appropriate, and then automatically responds.\n\nEnd-to-End Network Security provides you with a comprehensive look at the mechanisms to counter threats to each part of your network. The book starts with a review of network security technologies then covers the six-step methodology for incident response and best practices from proactive security frameworks. Later chapters cover wireless network security, IP telephony security, data center security, and IPv6 security. Finally, several case studies representing small, medium, and large enterprises provide detailed example configurations and implementation strategies of best practices learned in earlier chapters.\n\nAdopting the techniques and strategies outlined in this book enables you to prevent day-zero attacks, improve your overall security posture, build strong policies, and deploy intelligent, self-defending networks.\n\n“Within these pages, you will find many practical tools, both process related and technology related, that you can draw on to improve your risk mitigation strategies.”\n\n—Bruce Murphy, Vice President, World Wide Security Practices, Cisco\n\nOmar Santos is a senior network security engineer at Cisco®.

Yet many on Wall Street continue to rely on standard models based on artificially simplified assumptions that can lead to systematic (and sometimes catastrophic) underestimation of real risks.\n\nIn Practical Methods of Financial Engineering and Risk Management, Dr. Rupak Chatterjee former director of the multi-asset quantitative research group at Citiintroduces finance professionals and advanced students to the latest concepts, tools, valuation techniques, and analytic measures being deployed by the more discerning and responsive Wall Street practitioners, on all operational scales from day trading to institutional strategy, to model and analyze more faithfully the real behavior and risk exposure of financial markets in the cold light of the post-2008 realities.

Building on the work of Schank and Abelson, the author uses goals as the basis for a model of interpersonal relations which permits decisions to incorporate personal and adopted goals in a uniform manner. The theory is modelled on the VOTE computer program which simulates Congressional roll-call voting decisions. The VOTE program expands traditional decision making and simulation models by providing not only a choice, but also a natural language explanation, in either English or French. It simulates real members of Congress voting on real bills, and producing reasonable explanations. The program is consistent with much of the descriptive political science literature on Congressional decision making and provides an explicit model of political issues, relationships, and strategies that converge in voting behavior. In developing the VOTE program, the author draws on his own practical experience in politics from four presidential campaigns and the White House. Given the underlying psychological basis of the program, VOTE can be extended to other decision making domains different from politics. Another use for the program is to simulate business decisions such as securities analysis, as well as mundane decision making such as choosing a college or deciding whether to get a Mohawk haircut.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Science","Psychology"]},{"id":"9781118539514","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"ERM - Enterprise Risk Management: Issues and Cases","authors":["Christopher Ketcham","Jean-Paul Louisot"],"pages":"280","publication_date":"June 2014","description":"A wealth of international case studies illustrating current issues and emerging best practices in enterprise risk management\n\nDespite enterprise risk management's relative newness as a recognized business discipline, the marketplace is replete with guides and references for ERM practitioners.

Objects also form the basis for many web technologies such as JavaScript, Python, and PHP.\n\nIt is of vital importance to learn the fundamental concepts of object orientation before starting to use object-oriented development environments. OOP promotes good design practices, code portability, and reuse–but it requires a shift in thinking to be fully understood. Programmers new to OOP should resist the temptation to jump directly into a particular programming language (such as Objective-C, VB .NET, C++, C# .NET, or Java) or a modeling language (such as UML), and instead first take the time to learn what author Matt Weisfeld calls “the object-oriented thought process.”\n\nWritten by a developer for developers who want to make the leap to object-oriented technologies, The Object-Oriented Thought Process provides a solutions-oriented approach to object-oriented programming. Readers will learn to understand the proper uses of inheritance and composition, the difference between aggregation and association, and the important distinction between interfaces and implementations.\n\nWhile programming technologies have been changing and evolving over the years, object-oriented concepts remain a constant–no matter what the platform. This revised edition focuses on interoperability across programming technologies, whether you are using objects in traditional application design, in XML-based data transactions, in web page development, in mobile apps, or in any modern programming environment.\n\n“Programmers who aim to create high quality software–as all programmers should–must learn the varied subtleties of the familiar yet not so familiar beasts called objects and classes.

The new edition makes more use of modern tools for working problems, such as COMSOL®, Maple®, and MATLAB®. It introduces new problems at the end of each chapter and sorts them by topic for ease of use. It also presents new concepts to expand the utility of the text beyond chemical engineering.The text is divided into two parts, which can be used for teaching a two-term course. Part I covers the balance equation in the context of diffusive transport—momentum, energy, mass, and charge. Each chapter adds a term to the balance equation, highlighting that term's effects on the physical behavior of the system and the underlying mathematical description. Chapters familiarize students with modeling and developing mathematical expressions based on the analysis of a control volume, the derivation of the governing differential equations, and the solution to those equations with appropriate boundary conditions.Part II builds on the diffusive transport balance equation by introducing convective transport terms, focusing on partial, rather than ordinary, differential equations. The text describes paring down the microscopic equations to simplify the models and solve problems, and it introduces macroscopic versions of the balance equations for when the microscopic approach fails or is too cumbersome. The text discusses the momentum, Bournoulli, energy, and species continuity equations, including a brief description of how these equations are applied to heat exchangers, continuous contactors, and chemical reactors. The book also introduces the three fundamental transport coefficients: the friction factor, the heat transfer coefficient, and the mass transfer coefficient in the context of boundary layer theory. The final chapter covers the basics of radiative heat transfer, including concepts such as blackbodies, graybodies, radiation shields, and enclosures.

Other one dimensional or zonally averaged models are subsequently presented, along with various applications, including chapters on paleoclimatology, the inception of continental glaciations, detection of signals in the climate system, and optimal estimation of large scale quantities from point scale data. Throughout the book, the authors work on two mathematical levels: qualitative physical expositions of the subject material plus optional mathematical sections that include derivations and treatments of the equations along with some proofs of stability theorems. A must-have introduction for policy makers, environmental agencies, and NGOs, as well as climatologists, molecular physicists, and meteorologists.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Science","Geology"]},{"id":"9781680451160","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Forrest Mims' Science Experiments","authors":["Forrest M.

Studies and research in biomechanics now exceed those in basic mechanics itself, underlining the continuing and increasing importance of this area of study. With an emphasis on biodynamic modeling, Fundamentals of Biomechanics provides an accessible, basic understanding of the principles of biomechanics analyses.\n\nFollowing a brief introductory chapter, the book reviews gross human anatomy and basic terminology currently in use. It describes methods of analysis from elementary mathematics to elementary mechanics and goes on to fundamental concepts of the mechanics of materials. It then covers the modeling of biosystems and provides a brief overview of tissue biomechanics. The author then introduces the concepts of biodynamics and human body modeling, looking at the fundamentals of the kinematics, the kinetics, and the inertial properties of human body models. He supplies a more detailed analysis of kinematics, kinetics, and dynamics of these models and discusses the numerical procedures for solving the governing dynamical equations. The book concludes with a review of a few example applications of biodynamic models such as simple lifting, maneuvering in space, walking, swimming, and crash victim simulation.\n\nThe inclusion of extensive lists of problems of varying difficulty, references, and an extensive bibliography add breadth and depth to the coverage. Focusing on biodynamic modeling to a degree not found in other texts, this book equips readers with the expertise in biomechanics they need for advanced studies, research, and employment in biomedical engineering.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Science","Biology"]},{"id":"9780321648013","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Lean-Agile Software Development: Achieving Enterprise Agility","authors":["Alan Shalloway","Guy Beaver","James R.

Maybe it’s in your workplace, or in your relationships, or simply in your own life.  But great leadership—leadership that aligns teams, inspires action, and achieves results—is hard. And what makes it hard isn’t theoretical, it’s practical. It’s not about knowing what to say or do.

As with any investigation, a timeline is constructed, and, with the aid of smart devices providing data, investigators might be able to capture much more specific data points than in a traditional crime. However, collecting this data can often be a challenge, as it frequently doesn’t live on the device itself, but rather in the provider’s cloud platform.

Beyond, between, and besides the climb up the positional ladder, there are many other ways that employees can—and want to—grow. However, many organizations still operate under the notion that promotions are the only option for career development, leaving employees disengaged, managers frustrated, and the business disadvantaged in its efforts to retain talent.\n\nThe good news is that career development is so much more than promotions alone, and managers are in a powerful position to redefine career development and create positive results for their employees and their organizations in this area.\n\nIn Promotions Are So Yesterday, Julie Winkle Giulioni offers you a new approach for developing your employees’ careers and helping them thrive in a company when promotions are not readily available. Discover an easy-to-apply framework of seven alternative dimensions of development (contribution, competence, confidence, connection, challenge, contentment, and choice) that will engage your employees—dynamic opportunities for growth that are completely within your control as a manager.\n\nPromotions Are So Yesterday is filled with practical advice, nearly 100 questions to spark reflection and productive dialogue, and actionable templates and tools that managers can use with employees.

An effective intelligence process can directly support and positively impact operational activity and associated decision-making and can even be used to drive the firm’s business in key markets. Corporate Security Intelligence and Strategic Decision-Making outlines the basic theory and supplies practical solutions for implementing an effective intelligence process in any commercial organization.\n\nThe main areas covered include how intelligence in the corporate security environment relates to strategic decision-making; the factors that drive the requirement for corporate security intelligence, as well as the main legislative and ethical imperatives; and how intelligence-led processes can not only prevent loss but also support business growth and revenue generation. Detailed topics include:\n\nFundamental and theoretical ideas underlying intelligence work in the public and private sector\nThe collection, validation, collation, and analysis of intelligence\nThe effective and safe dissemination of intelligence material and the different reporting formats available\nThe use of operational models to help guide structures, processes, and the deployment of resources\nHow to implement an effective intelligence function in a corporate environment\n\nThe topics include real-life examples of where intelligence has been used to support corporate operations and demonstrate how the theory applies to these practical examples, based on years of experience. While corporate security is the natural home of intelligence, the tools and techniques outlined are of course equally applicable for any decision-support process—making this book valuable reading for any leader.","tags":["Security"]},{"id":"9781315454795","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Counterproductive Work Behaviors","authors":["Aaron Cohen"],"pages":"262","publication_date":"January 2018","description":"Counterproductive Work Behaviors will cover the important issue of dark triad personalities in the workplace.

This important book, rather than simply recount a litany of corporate governance failures, persuasively explains why, despite policymakers' best intentions, regulation has failed in the modern era. An objective study intended for a diverse readership, Corporate Governance Regulation unveils the underlying, root causes of regulatory failure. The result: A compelling and original analysis, broadly suited for a global audience of all backgrounds.\n\nWritten by published, subject-area experts, the authors carefully delineate how U.S. corporate governance regulation, beginning with Sarbanes Oxley, lacks an adequate rational basis, as may be attributed to a non-existent policy dialogue\n\nThe witnessed result: A conspicuous lack of regulatory efficacy, enormous costs, coupled with paltry benefits\n\nThe focus is upon reigniting a stalled, non-productive policy dialogue, by eschewing stale, overly-polemicized arguments, as needed to develop a common ground\n\nDrawing from an eclectic, analytic framework, governance experts Nicholas Vakkur and Zulma Herrera offer both the professional and global citizen alike a multi-dimensional understanding of issues critical to global economic health.

How should one think about continuous improvement in a modern world? Is Lean Six Sigma the best approach to take for all problems, including large, complex, unstructured problems, such as climate change or the Millennial Development Goals? The authors argue that a different paradigm is needed to take continuous improvement to a new level in the world in which we now find ourselves. Snee and Hoerl refer to this paradigm as Holistic Improvement, and suggest Lean Six Sigma 2.0, the next version of Lean Six Sigma, as the best methodology based on this paradigm.

Shellcode – Shellcode, commonly defined as bytecode converted from Assembly, is utilized to execute commands on remote systems via direct memory access. 4. Porting – Due to the differences between operating platforms and language implementations on those platforms, it is a common practice to modify an original body of code to work on a different platforms.

This book takes an approach to evidence synthesis that is specifically intended for decision making when there are two or more treatment alternatives being evaluated, and assumes that the purpose of every synthesis is to answer the question “for this pre-identified population of patients, which treatment is ‘best’?”\n\nA comprehensive, coherent framework for network meta-analysis (mixed treatment comparisons) is adopted and estimated using Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods implemented in the freely available software WinBUGS. Each chapter contains worked examples, exercises, solutions and code that may be adapted by readers to apply to their own analyses.\n\nThis book can be used as an introduction to evidence synthesis and network meta-analysis, its key properties and policy implications. Examples and advanced methods are also presented for the more experienced reader.\n\n \n\nMethods used throughout this book can be applied consistently: model critique and checking for evidence consistency are emphasised.\nMethods are based on technical support documents produced for NICE Decision Support Unit, which support the NICE Methods of Technology Appraisal.\nCode presented is also the basis for the code used by the ISPOR Task Force on Indirect Comparisons.\nIncludes extensive carefully worked examples, with thorough explanations of how to set out data for use in WinBUGS and how to interpret the output.\n\nNetwork Meta-Analysis for Decision Making will be of interest to decision makers, medical statisticians, health economists, and anyone involved in Health Technology Assessment including the pharmaceutical industry.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Science","Medical Science"]},{"id":"9781482205572","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Six Sigma Case Studies with Minitab®","authors":["Kishore K.

Yet, technical people are often resistant to traditional \"touchy-feely\" teambuilding.\n\nTo improve communication, performance, and morale among NASA's technical teams, former NASA Astrophysicist Dr. Charlie Pellerin developed the teambuilding process described in \"How NASA Builds Teams\"—an approach that is proven, quantitative, and requires only a fraction of the time and resources of traditional training methods. This \"4-D\" process has boosted team performance in hundreds of NASA project teams, engineering teams, and management teams, including the people responsible for NASA's most complex systems — the Space Shuttle, space telescopes, robots on Mars, and the mission back to the moon. How NASA Builds Teams explains how the 4-D teambuilding process can be applied in any organization, and includes a fast, free on-line behavioral assessment to help your team and the individual members understand each other and measure the key driver of team performance, the social context.\n\nMoreover, these simple, logical processes appeal strongly to technical teams who eschew \"touchy-feely\" training. Pellerin applies simple, elegant principles from his physics background to the art teambuilding, such as the use of a coordinate system to analyze the characteristics of team performance into actionable elements.\n\nThe author illustrates the teambuilding process with entertaining stories from his decade as NASA's Director for Astrophysics and subsequent 15 years of working closely with NASA and outside business teams. For example, he tells how the processes in the book enabled him to initiate the space mission to fix the Hubble Space Telescope's flawed mirror.\n\nFree downloadable resources will help you:\n\nIdentify your teammates' innate personalities\n\nDiagram your culture (And compare it to your customer's)\n\nMeasure the coherency of your project's paradigm (Get this wrong and you will be fired!) and\n\nLearn to meet people's need to feel valued by you.\n\nFurther, you can download and use Pellerin's most powerful tool for influencing the outcome of any difficult situation: the Context Shifting Worksheet.\n\nNote: The ebook version does not provide access to the companion files.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills"]},{"id":"9781003845447","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Business of Cyber","authors":["Peter Fagan"],"pages":"278","publication_date":"February 2024","description":"This book examines the cybersecurity phenomenon, looking at the folklore, the hype, and the behaviour of its practitioners.

To do all that, clearly the data must be accurate and organized so it is accessible and understandable to all who need it.\n\nThat task has grown in importance as the volume of enterprise data has been growing significantly (analyst estimates of 40 - 50% growth per year are not uncommon) over the years. However, most of that data has been what we call \"structured\" data, which is the type that can fit neatly into rows and columns and be more easily analyzed. Now we are in the era of \"big data.\" This significantly increases the volume of data available, but it is in a form called \"unstructured\" data. That is, data from sources that are not as easily organized, such as data from emails, spreadsheets, sensors, video, audio, and social media sites. There is valuable information in all that data but it calls for new processes to enable it to be analyzed.\n\nAll this has brought with it a renewed and critical need to manage and organize that data with clarity of meaning, understandability, and interoperability. That is, you must be able to integrate this data when it is from within an enterprise but also importantly when it is from many different external sources.\n\nWhat is described here has been and is being done to varying extents.

But without governance, much of the data can be less useful and perhaps even used incorrectly, significantly impacting enterprise decision making. So we must also respect the needs for information security, consistency, and validity or else suffer the potential economic and legal consequences. Implementing sound governance practices needs to be an integral part of the information control in our organizations.\n\nThis IBM® Redbooks® publication focuses on the building blocks of a solid governance program. It examines some familiar governance initiative scenarios, identifying how they underpin key governance initiatives, such as Master Data Management, Quality Management, Security and Privacy, and Information Lifecycle Management. IBM Information Management and Governance solutions provide a comprehensive suite to help organizations better understand and build their governance solutions. The book also identifies new and innovative approaches that are developed by IBM practice leaders that can help as you implement the foundation capabilities in your organizations.","tags":["Security","Governance, Risk Management and Compliance (GRC)","Governance"]},{"id":"9780857084217","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"The Power of Doing Less: Why Time Management Courses Don't Work And How To Spend Your Precious Life On The Things That Really Matter","authors":["Fergus O'Connell"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"September 2013","description":"Overloaded?

From biofuels and bulk amino acids to monoclonal antibodies and stem cells, they all rely on mass suspension cultivation of cells in stirred bioreactors, which is the most widely used and versatile way to produce. Today, a wide array of cells can be cultivated in this way, and for most of them genetic engineering tools are also available. Examples of products, operating procedures, engineering and design aspects, economic drivers and cost, and regulatory issues are addressed. In addition, there will be a discussion of how we got to where we are today, and of the real world in industrial fermentation.

A complete examination of the application of continuum of care, The Case Management Workbook: Defining the Role of Physicians, Nurses, and Case Managers defines the roles of the case management team and provides an overview of key post acute venues of care. It supplies an overview of the process, its structure, and the responsibility of each member of the team. The book discusses how managing the care of the patient in today’s healthcare environment will take a concerted effort from the entire case management team—not just a handful of case managers.\n\nThe authors demonstrate that the case management team includes many more individuals than simply those with the title of case manager. The team must consist of key clinical personnel including the nurse, the physician and the case manager, each of whom have specific roles in case management. The book also highlights the role administration plays in assuring each member of the team is on board with the hospital’s or health system’s goal in assuring the patient is at the right place at the right time in their episode of care.\n\nIn the words of the authors, case managers are … the unsung heroes of effective healthcare delivery. They push and they prod, they inform and they educate, they provide valuable information to physicians and families with a common goal—to assure the patient is provided care in the most appropriate venue correlative to the medical resources needed and provided. In their book they explore a key byproduct of an effective case management system— the realization of an effective integrated health system whereby physicians and hospitals are aligned as caretakers of future health resources.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Science","Medical Science","Nursing"]},{"id":"0321160762","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Real Time UML: Advances in The UML for Real-Time Systems, Third Edition","authors":["Bruce Powel Douglass"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"February 2004","description":"Praise for Real Time UML, Third Edition\n\n“I found Real Time UML, Third Edition, to provide an informative and practical application of UML 2.0 to the development of real-time systems, and well worth the read by systems and software engineers.

However, large-scale agile development is difficult, and publicly available case studies have been scarce. Now, three agile pioneers at Hewlett-Packard present a candid, start-to-finish insider’s look at how they’ve succeeded with agile in one of the company’s most mission-critical software environments: firmware for HP LaserJet printers. This book tells the story of an extraordinary experiment and journey. Could agile principles be applied to re-architect an enormous legacy code base? Could agile enable both timely delivery and ongoing innovation? Could it really be applied to 400+ developers distributed across four states, three continents, and four business units? Could it go beyond delivering incremental gains, to meet the stretch goal of 10x developer productivity improvements? It could, and it did—but getting there was not easy. Writing for both managers and technologists, the authors candidly discuss both their successes and failures, presenting actionable lessons for other development organizations, as well as approaches that have proven themselves repeatedly in HP’s challenging environment. They not only illuminate the potential benefits of agile in large-scale development, they also systematically show how these benefits can actually be achieved.

Everyone who works must deal with countless emails, constant communication, cascading deadlines, and seemingly endless meetings. These can be managed efficiently, or they can be a huge time suck. When you're surrounded by slow-moving coworkers, you're stuck in a traffic jam of sorts. What makes the difference isn't individuals working harder or faster or smarter but “teaming well.” You have at your disposal what Stack calls “the most powerful productivity machine in existence”: your team. Individual productivity is just the beginning of business profitability; the real winner is team productivity. A good team can accomplish more, and more quickly, than any one Lone Ranger. Yes, there are always stars—in sports, Peyton Manning, Mia Hamm, and Stephen Curry come to mind—but they couldn't do their jobs without the rest of the team doing theirs.

Pathogenic bacteria have been evolving and spreading resistance to diverse classes of antibiotics. As a result, we risk losing our ability to control and treat infectious diseases. Understanding antibiotic resistance, therefore, is becoming increasingly essential for a broad audience of healthcare professionals, biomedical and public health researchers, students, and policymakers. The authors answer questions such as: What is resistance? How does it emerge? How do common human activities contribute to resistance? What can we do about it? How can we strengthen our “first lines of defense” against resistance? Are there better ways to discover new antibiotics? What unique issues are associated with MRSA and viral influenza? In addition to defining and evaluating one of the most important emerging threats to public health, the authors explain what can be done to minimize risks to public health, and to preserve and extend the effectiveness of existing and new antibiotics.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Science","Medical Science"]},{"id":"9780863773532","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Flashbulb Memories","authors":["Martin Conway"],"pages":"140","publication_date":"June 2013","description":"This book provides a state-of-the-art review and critical evaluation of research into 'flashbulb' memories. The opening chapters explore the 'encoding' view of flashbulb memory formation and critically appraise a number of lines of research that have opposed this view. It is concluded that this research does not provide convincing evidence for the rejection of the encoding view. Subsequent chapters review and appraise more recent work which has generally found in favour of the flashbulb concept. But this research too, does not provide unequivocal support for the encoding view of flashbulb memory formation. Evidence from clinical studies of flashbulb memories, particularly in post-traumatic stress disorder and related emotional disturbances, is then considered. The clinical studies provide the most striking evidence of flashbulb memories and strongly suggest that these arise in response to intense affective experiences. Neurobiological models of memory formation are briefly reviewed and one view suggesting that there may be multiple routes to memory formation is explored in detail. From this research it seems possible that there could be a specific route for the formation of detailed and durable memories associated with emotional experiences. In the final chapter a cognitive account of flashbulb memories is outlined. This account is centred on recent plan-based theories of emotion and proposes that flashbulb memories arise in responses to disruptions of personal and cultural plans. This chapter also considers the wider functions of flashbulb memories and their potential role in the formation of generational identity.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Science","Psychology"]},{"id":"9781783984749","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Mastering SciPy","authors":["Francisco Javier Blanco-Silva","Francisco Javier B Silva"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"November 2015","description":"Dive into 'Mastering SciPy' to unlock the full potential of the SciPy ecosystem for scientific computation and data analysis.

This book explores this process by focusing on the communication practices that people engage in when using their in-car systems and when talking about their vehicles with co-passengers. Chapters present a robust theory and methodology for studying communication in cars, how tasks are begun and ended, how people switch between tasks, how non-task talk appears, what ways and styles of communication drivers prefer, and how they expect the system voice to respond, among other things. Particular attention is given to cultural preferences as they are evident in this communication; these preferences are found to ground various trajectories in the use and meaning of in-car communication practices.

A neuropsychologist explains how.\n\nYour drive to create change, catalyze impact, and build relationships all come from neuroelectrical energy—real, electrical impulses—firing in your brain. Who you are as a person depends on how you work with this energy. When this energy rises within you, you feel empowered and dynamic. But when this energy falls, you feel down, stressed, and defeated.\n\nYou may feel as if you don't control your emotional energy, that it's an inevitable consequence of the world around you and the forces bearing down on you. But that's not the case. To reach your full potential, you can learn to recognize and harness the energy in your brain. Leading neuropsychologist Julia DiGangi will teach you how through eight \"codes.\" Some of the codes will surprise you. All will fortify you. You will learn why these codes work and how to apply them to your own challenges through exercises and reflections.\n\nWhen you start viewing your life less about the activities you do and more about the natural energies within and around you, your power to live and lead with impact grows exponentially. Energy Rising offers you a provocative and neuroscientifically accurate path to greater emotional power, influence, and connection, both at work and at home.\n\nDiGangi's lab and clinical work have been conducted at Harvard, Columbia, Georgetown University, the University of Chicago, DePaul, and the University of Illinois Chicago. Her fMRI and EEG research has helped business leaders, parents, couples, educators, and military leaders. Her work, rooted in resilience after extreme stress, will show you how to effectively deal with struggles you currently face. She tells the stories of business leaders, parents, couples—and even combat veterans and trauma survivors—who used the eight codes to rise.\n\nGet ready to feel your energy rising.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Communication","Emotional Intelligence"]},{"id":"9780134663906","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Essentials of Chemical Reaction Engineering, 2nd Edition","authors":["H.

With the aid of a model-building approach, readers discover the answer to this question and come to appreciate its important applications in computing, cryptography, quantum teleportation, and opto-electronics. Instead of taking a traditional approach that requires readers to first master a series of seemingly unconnected mathematical techniques, this book engages the readers' interest and imagination by going straight to the point, introducing the mathematics along the way as needed. Appendices are provided for the additional mathematical theory.\n\nResearchers, scientists, and students of modern physics can refer to Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics and examine the field thoroughly. Several key topics covered that readers cannot find in any other quantum optics book include:\n\nIntroduction to the problem of the \"vacuum catastrophe\" and the cosmological constant\n\nDetailed up-to-date account of cavity QED lasers and thresholdless lasing\n\nExamination of cavities with movable walls\n\nFirst-principles discussion about cavity QED in open cavities\n\nPedagogical account of microscopic quantization in dielectrics\n\nComplementing the coverage of the most advanced theory and techniques, the author provides context by discussing the historical evolution of the field and its discoveries. In that spirit, \"recommended reading,\" provided in each chapter, leads readers to both contemporary literature as well as key historical papers.\n\nDespite being one of many specialties within physics, cavity quantum electrodynamics serves as a window to many of the fundamental issues of physics. Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics will serve as an excellent resource for advanced undergraduate quantum mechanics courses as well as for graduate students, researchers, and scientists who need a comprehensive introduction to the field.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Science","Physics"]},{"id":"9781394280834","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Beyond the Break","authors":["Christo Hall"],"pages":"224","publication_date":"September 2024","description":"What can a big wave teach you about living a big life?\n\nSharing remarkable experiences from the world of professional surfing, Christo Hall offers a unique perspective on how we operate under pressure.

It takes courage and hard work. Too often, we charge down a path leading to “success” as defined by those around us—and ultimately, are left feeling dissatisfied. Each of us is unique and brings distinctive skills and qualities to any situation. So why is it that most of us fail to spend sufficient time learning to understand ourselves and creating our own definition of success? The truth is, it can seem so natural and so much easier to just do what everyone else is doing—for now—leaving it for later to develop our best selves and figure out our own unique path. Is there a road map that will enable you to defy conventional wisdom, resist peer pressure, and carve out a path that fits your unique skills and passions? Harvard Business School’s Robert Steven Kaplan, leadership expert and author of the highly successful book What to Ask the Person in the Mirror, regularly advises executives and students on how to tackle these questions. In this indispensable new book, Kaplan shares a specific and actionable approach to defining your own success and reaching your potential. Drawing on his years of experience, Kaplan proposes an integrated plan for identifying and achieving your goals.

Today's new, young workforce has so much to offer—new technical skills, new ideas, new perspective, new energy. Yet too many of them are held back because of their weak soft skills.\n\nSoft skills may be harder to define and measure than hard skills, but they are just as critical. People get hired because of their hard skills but get fired because of their soft skills.\n\nSetting a good example or simply telling young workers they need to improve isn't enough, nor is scolding them or pointing out their failings in an annual review. However you can teach the missing basics to today's young talent.\n\nBased on more than twenty years of research, Bruce Tulgan, renowned expert on the millennial workforce, offers concrete solutions to help managers teach the missing basics of professionalism, critical thinking, and followership—complete with ninety-two step-by-step lesson plans designed to be highly flexible and easy to use.\n\nTulgan's research and proven approach has show that the key to teaching young people the missing soft skills lies in breaking down critical soft skills into their component parts, concentrating on one small component at a time, with the help of a teaching-style manager. Almost all of the exercises can be done in less than an hour within a team meeting or an extended one-on-one. The exercises are easily modified and customized and can be used as take-home exercises for any individual or group, to guide one-on-one discussions with direct-reports and in the classroom as written exercises or group discussions.\n\nManagers—and their young employees—will find themselves returning to their favorite exercises over and over again. One exercise at a time, managers will build up the most important soft skills of their new, young talent. These critical soft skills can make the difference between mediocre and good, between good and great, between great and one of a kind.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills"]},{"id":"9781484264430","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Asp.Net Core and Azure with Raspberry Pi 4: .Net Core Applications in Raspbian OS","authors":["Sibeesh Venu"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"November 2020","description":"Take your Raspberry Pi further with Asp.net and Microsoft Azure.

Microstress doesn't trigger the normal stress response in our brains to help us deal with it. Instead, it embeds itself in our minds and accumulates daily, one microstress on top of the other. The long-term impact can be debilitating. Unregistered microstress weighs us down, damages our physical and emotional health, and contributes to a decline in our well-being. What's more, microstress is baked into our lives. The source is seldom a classic antagonist, such as a demanding client or a jerk boss. Instead, it comes from the people with whom we are closest: our friends, family, and colleagues.\n\nThe good news is that once you understand microstress, you can fight back. Drawing on fresh research, Rob Cross and Karen Dillon explain the science behind the phenomenon. They also share the secrets of a small set of people who've endured their share of microstress but have still managed to cultivate relationships that enable them to thrive both at work and in life.

Because almost every aspect of an enterprise is now dependent on technology, the focus of IT security must shift from locking down assets to enabling the business while managing and surviving risk. The book discusses business risk from a broader perspective, including privacy and regulatory considerations. It describes the increasing number of threats and vulnerabilities, but also offers strategies for developing solutions.

Focusing on the practical implementation, the methods volume provides readers with rapid access to process modelling and control, while including the theoretical background necessary. Throughout, the essential knowledge is built up from chapter to chapter, starting with laying the foundations in plant instrumentation and control. Modelling abilities are then developed by starting from simple time-loop algorithms and passing on to discrete methods, Laplace transforms, automata and fuzzy logic. In the end, readers have the means to design simple controllers on the basis of their own models, and to use more detailed models to test them. With its clarity and simplicity of presentation, and illustrated by more than 200 diagrams, the volume supports self-study and teaches readers how to apply the appropriate method for the application required, and how to handle problems in process control. Bridging theory and practice, the second volume contains over 200 practical exercises and their solutions to develop the problem-solving abilities of process engineers. The problems were developed by the author during his many years of teaching at university and are kept brief, taken from the fields of instrumentation, modeling, plant control, control strategy design and stability of control. The algorithm flows and codes, which are mostly based on MATLAB?, are given in many cases and allow for easy translation into applications.

The practices themselves may be worth trying, but by understanding why it works the readers will be able to come up with their own ideas that work better in their organization and situation. All the practical examples in this book have helped someone, somewhere to become a part of a better Scrum team.\n\nScrum's motto is: Inspect and Adapt; change small things one at a time and see what works. Scrum is not done by project leaders or managers, but really by the teams-to succeed in an organization, the teams must do Scrum well. If the teams do Scrum well, the whole organization will benefit from it. Scrum helps a team self-organize, which fits in well with developers, who usually don't like to be micromanaged. At the same time, Scrum can scale: Self-organized teams work together well, and one manager doesn't have to manage all the people.\n\nThe lessons from this book help Scrum teams develop into autonomous, proud, and independent teams. Often teams fail to become powerful enough to change the organization, so they cannot perform to their full potential. A good team can lead the stakeholders into trusting them. They will then make plans based on the team's release planning instead of making roadmaps out of thin air, and thus make the organization much more predictable.","tags":["Software Development","Software Collaboration","Agile","Scrum"]},{"id":"9780132478373","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"SOA Governance: Governing Shared Services On-Premise and in the Cloud","authors":["Thomas Erl","Stephen G.

This makes it an indispensable source of information for any SOA practitioner or any professional who plans to start an SOA initiative.”\n\n--Jean-Paul De Baets, Principal SOA Architect, Fedict (Belgian Federal Government Information and Communication Technology Service)\n\n“This book on SOA governance provides both thoughtful and carefully crafted narrative and the supplementation of poignant real-world case studies that will help practitioners calibrate guidance to realities on the ground. This is a terrific book that will be heavily used--with tab stickers, dog-ears, highlighting, and column notes abounding to show for it--as practitioners strategize and subsequently iterate through organizational learnings on their journeys to SOA maturity.”\n\n--David S. Rogers, Manager, IEEE Conferences Business and Technology Solutions Office\n\n“Thomas Erl’s SOA Governance clarifies the principles behind this crucial capability for SOA adoption. Finally, a contribution that serves as a guide for project managers, architects, and any related role that has a common goal: the establishment, administration, and vision behind a service-enabled enterprise. Accenture sees this book as a milestone that will support the rationale behind selling and delivering SOA governance projects around the world.”\n\n--Dr. Matthias Ziegler, Accenture; Dr. Jure Zakotnik, Accenture; Thomas M. Michelbach, Accenture\n\n“Thomas Erl’s SOA Governance book fills in an important missing piece for any organization wanting to move to--and succeed with--an enterprise commitment to implement SOA and realize its overarching benefits. Of equal importance, however, is the fact that the basic concepts and frameworks that the book instantiates in the context of SOA can also be productively applied in other contexts that are not formally ‘SOA-esque,’ but where complexity is in need of formal governance.”\n\n--Charles N. Mead, MD, MSc., Senior Technical Advisor to the Director, National Cancer Institute Center for Bioinformatics and Information Technology (NCI CBIIT) Chair, Architecture Board, Health Level 7 (HL7)\n\n“SOA Governance is the best read on governance and software delivery processes since the publication of RUP; it is the book that defines the standard Service Delivery Processes for all project lifecycle models and defines the necessary conditions and roadmap to reach SOA in the IT organization.”\n\n--Filippos Santas, IT Architect, Credit Suisse Private Banking, Switzerland, and Certified SOA Trainer\n\n“Achieving your service-oriented goals requires controlled growth and change, which are best accomplished through rigorous governance. The authors of this work drive to the heart of governance and show you how to manage your portfolio of services.”\n\n--Kevin P. Davis, Ph.D., Software Architect\n\nThe Definitive Guide to Governing Shared Services and SOA Projects\n\nSOA Governance: Governing Shared Services On-Premise and in the Cloud is the result of a multi-year project to collect proven industry practices for establishing IT governance controls specific to the adoption of SOA and service-orientation. Authored by world-renowned experts in the fields of SOA, IT governance, and cloud computing, this comprehensive book provides clear direction as to what does and does not constitute SOA governance and then steps the reader through the most important industry governance practices, as they pertain to individual SOA project lifecycle stages.\n\nWith a consistent, vendor-neutral focus, and with the help of case study examples, the authors demonstrate how to define and position precepts, organizational roles, processes, standards, and metrics. Readers benefit from thorough and visually depicted cross-references and mapping between roles, processes, precepts, and project stages, enabling them to fully explore dynamics and dependencies and thereby learn how to use these governance controls to create their own custom SOA governance systems.\n\nThis important title will be valuable to every practitioner concerned with making SOA work, including senior IT managers, project managers, architects, analysts, developers, administrators, QA professionals, security specialists, and cloud computing professionals.\n\nTopic Areas\n\nDefining SOA governance\n\nEstablishing an SOA governance office and program\n\nWorking with proven SOA governance precepts and processes\n\nIdentifying organizational roles and relating them to SOA governance\n\nAssociating design-time and runtime SOA project stages with SOA governance controls\n\nGovernance considerations specific to shared services\n\nRoles, precepts, and factors specific to cloud-based services\n\nUnderstanding and categorizing SOA governance products and technologies\n\nApplying governance controls as early as the planning stages and measuring their success in subsequent stages\n\nUsing vitality triggers to govern shared services on an on-going basis\n\nSOA governance controls that pertain to business information documents and policies","tags":["Security","Governance, Risk Management and Compliance (GRC)","Governance"]},{"id":"9781491994368","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Reactive Microsystems","authors":["Jonas Bonér"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"September 2017","description":"If you want your application to provide millisecond response times and close to 100% uptime, traditional architectures with single SQL databases and thread-per-request models simply cannot compete with microservices.

So what can be done? The key to understanding the causes of disasters and mitigating their impacts is the concept of 'vulnerability'.\n\nMapping Vulnerability analyses 'vulnerability' as a concept central to the way we understand disasters and their magnitude and impact. Written and edited by a distinguished group of disaster scholars and practitioners, this book is a counterbalance to those technocratic approaches that limit themselves to simply looking at disasters as natural phenomena. Through the notion of vulnerability, the authors stress the importance of social processes and human-environmental interactions as causal agents in the making of disasters. They critically examine what renders communities unsafe - a condition, they argue, that depends primarily on the relative position of advantage or disadvantage that a particular group occupies within a society's social order. The book also looks at vulnerability in terms of its relationship to development and its impact on policy and people's lives, through consideration of selected case studies drawn from Africa, Asia and Latin America. Mapping Vulnerability is essential reading for academics, students, policymakers and practitioners in disaster studies, geography, development studies, economics, environmental studies and sociology.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Science","Geology"]},{"id":"0201752794","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"A Guide to Forensic Testimony: The Art and Practice of Presenting Testimony as an Expert Technical Witness","authors":["Fred Chris Smith","Rebecca Gurley Bace"],"pages":"560","publication_date":"October 2002","description":"Information technology is an increasingly large factor in legal proceedings.

Every organization attempts to lower overhead while increasing donations, but this often proves to be impossible within existing frameworks. Effective fundraising - increasing donations while engaging more donors and lowering costs - requires a sound strategy that turns major roadblocks into minor hurdles that are easily overcome. It's not about trying harder, it's about working smarter.\n\nFundraising the SMART Way provides the groundwork for a complete revamp of organizational fundraising systems. Author Ellen Bristol applies twenty years of corporate sales experience and eighteen years in fund development consultation to the problem of inefficient fundraising. Bristol turns her extensive sales expertise toward the perspective of \"selling\" an organization to potential donors, increasing the donor pool, and lowering the cost of fundraising. The book details the questions every nonprofit should be asking to maximize the effectiveness of fundraising efforts, and encourages systematic strategy development by zeroing in on key factors such as:\n\nOrganizational goals, strengths, and weaknesses\n\nDonor actions and motivations\n\nWorkload management and results QA\n\nOpportunity evaluation and organizational action\n\nThe book outlines clear, concrete, actionable steps that can be immediately implemented to escalate income growth. Effective fundraising is sustainable, consistent, and on-target. It must exceed current need and expand to fill future need. Fundraising the SMART Way represents a true breakthrough in that it lays a foundation for true systemic overhaul, and can be the catalyst for the growth of any nonprofit.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Communication","Proposal Writing"]},{"id":"9781292063027","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Business Express: Presenting with confidence","authors":["Jenny Nabben"],"pages":"37","publication_date":"August 2014","description":"If you need to be in the know in no time at all, Business Express will get you from beginner to brilliant in the blink of an eye.\n\n \n\nThis fast, focused and carefully crafted eBook will help you pick up all the essential knowledge you need about the skills that matter most at work, all in the shortest possible time.\n\n \n\nLearn just when you need to or well in advance; read it at your desk or on the move; dip in and out or start from scratch – it’s all up to you.

The spirit in our workplace, to say nothing of our own spirit, is getting a little tattered, showing the early stages of what Harrison Owen calls \"Soul Pollution.\" Those in the advanced stages may find themselves plagued by exhaustion, high levels of stress, and the abuse of just about anything in sight, including spouses, substances, and fellow workers. So what is the secret to transforming organizations? The answer, says Owen, is simple: we must consciously be what we already are-natural, open, self-organizing systems.In The Power of Spirit, Owen examines the world of Spirit/Consciousness in organizations and offers help to those who find themselves dreading another day on the job in an organization seemingly bent on its own destruction, as well as the destruction of its members.

The book includes standard risk measurement models as well as alternative models that address options, structured credit risks, and the real-world complexities or risk modeling, and provides the institutional and historical background on financial innovation, liquidity, leverage, and financial crises that is crucial to practitioners and students of finance for understanding the world today.\n\nFinancial Risk Management is equally suitable for firm risk managers, economists, and policy makers seeking grounding in the subject. This timely guide skillfully surveys the landscape of financial risk and the financial developments of recent decades that culminated in the crisis. The book provides a comprehensive overview of the different types of financial risk we face, as well as the techniques used to measure and manage them. Topics covered include:\n\nMarket risk, from Value-at-Risk (VaR) to risk models for options\n\nCredit risk, from portfolio credit risk to structured credit products\n\nModel risk and validation\n\nRisk capital and stress testing\n\nLiquidity risk, leverage, systemic risk, and the forms they take\n\nFinancial crises, historical and current, their causes and characteristics\n\nFinancial regulation and its evolution in the wake of the global crisis\n\nAnd much more\n\nCombining the more model-oriented approach of risk management-as it has evolved over the past two decades-with an economist's approach to the same issues, Financial Risk Management is the essential guide to the subject for today's complex world.","tags":["Security","Governance, Risk Management and Compliance (GRC)","Operational Risk"]},{"id":"9780124046092","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Research Approaches to Sustainable Biomass Systems","authors":["Seishu Tojo","Tadashi Hirasawa"],"pages":"418","publication_date":"September 2013","description":"Researchers, students and engineers working with biofuels and biomass are increasingly expected to comprehend a new holistic systems perspective that begins with wise crop breeding and cultivation techniques and informs the entire conversion to energy process.

Packed with the authors' coaching insights and their “Big Five” strategies designed specifically for female executives, this book guides women to break past political barriers and get right to what they really want—influence. Authors Kathryn Heath, Jill Flynn, Mary Davis Holt, and Diana Faison make success far less complex, helping women overcome entrenched resistance to their ideas, create their own access points to power, and attract followers in a way that works for them. They present tools such as Influence Loops (to organically increase influence), Personal Scaffolding (to grow a groundswell of support), and Scenario Thinking (a savvy twist on strategic planning). These and other smart strategies finally allow women to succeed on their own terms.Illustrated with dozens of engaging, real stories culled from the authors' many years of coaching experience, The Influence Effect moves women past the politics problem and offers a new path to power. Actually, it's more than a path—it's a runway—it frees women to take off in their careers on their own terms. The Influence Effect will work for women, not because gender barriers will no longer exist, but because they will no longer hold women back.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Career Development"]},{"id":"9781784391492","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"PowerShell for SQL Server Essentials","authors":["Donabel Santos"],"pages":"186","publication_date":"February 2015","description":"Unlock the full potential of PowerShell to streamline SQL Server administration in this concise yet comprehensive guide.

'Managing Operational Risk in Financial Markets' outlines the major issues for risk management and focuses on operational risk as a key activity in managing risk on an enterprise-wide basis. While risk management had always been an integral part of financial activity, the 1990s has seen the requirement for risk management establish itself as a key function within banks and other financial institutions. With greater emphasis on ensuring that money is not lost through adverse market conditions, counterparty failure or inappropriate controls, systems or people, risk management has become a discipline in its own right. Managing risk is now THE paramount topic within the financial sector. Recurring major losses through the 1990s has shocked financial institutions into placing much greater emphasis on risk management and controls. The collapse of Barings and losses made by Metallgescellschaft, Orange County, Diawa and Sumitomo as a result of a lack of procedures, systems or managerial control has demonstrated to organisations the need to broaden the scope of their risk management activity from merely looking at market and credit risk. This has brought into focus the need for managing operational risk. Operational risk can only be managed on an enterprise wide basis as it includes the entire process of policies, culture, procedures, expertise and systems that an institution needs in order to manage all the risks resulting from its financial transactions. In fact, in order to effectively manage market and credit risks it is necessary to have the relevant skills and expertise in the staff, technical and organisational infrastructure, as well as monitoring and control systems. As all of these are components of operational risk, it then becomes apparent that an integrated risk management approach needs to focus on operational risk.Provides a comprehensive framework for the management of operational riskDefines the spectrum of risks faced by organisations and how they can effectively manage theseDevelops an enterprise-wide risk information system and defines the major challenges that need to be addressed in developing such a system","tags":["Security","Governance, Risk Management and Compliance (GRC)","Operational Risk"]},{"id":"9780470688694","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Monitoring and Control of Information-Poor Systems: An Approach Based on Fuzzy Relational Models","authors":["Arthur L. Dexter"],"pages":"336","publication_date":"April 2012","description":"The monitoring and control of a system whose behaviour is highly uncertain is an important and challenging practical problem. Methods of solution based on fuzzy techniques have generated considerable interest, but very little of the existing literature considers explicit ways of taking uncertainties into account. This book describes an approach to the monitoring and control of information-poor systems that is based on fuzzy relational models which generate fuzzy outputs.\n\nThe first part of Monitoring and Control of Information-Poor Systems aims to clarify why design decisions must take account of the uncertainty associated with optimal choices, and to explain how a fuzzy relational model can be used to generate a fuzzy output, which reflects the uncertainties associated with its predictions. Part two gives a brief introduction to fuzzy decision-making and shows how it can be used to design a predictive control scheme that is suitable for controlling information-poor systems using inaccurate measurements. Part three describes different ways in which fuzzy relational models can be generated online and explains the practical issues associated with their identification and application. The final part of the book provides examples of the use of the previously described techniques in real applications.\n\nKey features:\n\nDescribes techniques applicable to a wide range of engineering, environmental, medical, financial and economic applications\n\nUses simple examples to help explain the basic techniques for dealing with uncertainty\n\nDescribes a novel design approach based on the use of fuzzy relational models\n\nConsiders practical issues associated with applying the techniques to real systems\n\nMonitoring and Control of Information-Poor Systems forms an invaluable resource for a wide range of graduate students, and is also a comprehensive reference for researchers and practitioners working on problems involving mathematical modelling and control.","tags":["Security","Security Operations","Control Systems"]},{"id":"9781000462227","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Radiation Detection Systems, 2nd Edition","authors":["Jan Iwanczyk","Krzysztof Iniewski"],"pages":"310","publication_date":"November 2021","description":"This volume presents specific applications of the detection systems in medical imaging, industrial testing and security applications.

The research is basedon in-depth interviews with 15 ING executives and many front-line employees. The article highlightskey learnings at ING, largely from the point of view of the senior executives of the bank, and exploresthe challenges of implementing agile in an established organization, focusing on five lessons:1. Decide how much power you are willing to give up. Agile shifts power away from those at the topand puts ownership in the hands of those closest to the action. Unless top executives are willing toaccept that they are surrendering some status and power, agile will not be a good fit.2. Prepare stakeholders for the leap. ING executives had to sell agile to nervous stakeholders, including board members, employees, and bank regulators. For example, executives assured regulators thatfinance, compliance, and legal functions would continue to be managed in the traditional way.3. Build the structure around customers — and keep it fluid. Like other approaches to management,agile is focused on customers. ING in the Netherlands has tried to keep its organizational structurefluid so that it can evolve to do what's best for customers.4. Give employees the right balance of oversight and autonomy. A quarterly goal-setting process is part ofthe agile structure at ING in the Netherlands. This has been a learning process. Initially, groups definedgoals that were comfortably achievable, and executives had to urge them toward more ambitious targets.5. Provide employees with development and growth opportunities. The team-based structures used inagile can be scary for employees used to having their personal development and career progressionmapped out by HR departments or the mainstream career trajectories of a given industry. One lessonfrom ING's experience is that finding proper coaching and support for agile — and the new, long-termresponsibilities employees must embrace — is one of the hardest parts of the transformation.","tags":["Software Development","Software Collaboration","Agile"]},{"id":"53863MIT60305","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Can We Really Test People for Potential?","authors":["Reb Rebele"],"pages":"6","publication_date":"April 2019","description":"A good psychometric test can easily outperform a résumé scan and interview at predicting job performance and retention.

This is a fantastic, timely book that I highly recommend.\"—Steve Kerr, Head Coach, Golden State WarriorsKnowing how to transform conflict is critical in both our personal and professional lives. Yet, by and large, we are terrible at it. The reason, says longtime mediator Chad Ford, is fear. When conflict comes, our instincts are to run or fight. To transform conflict, Ford says we need to turn toward the people we are in conflict with, put down our physical and emotional weapons, and really love them with the kind of love that leads us to treat others as fellow human beings, not as objects in our way. We have to open ourselves up with no guarantee that anyone on the other side will do the same. While this can feel even more dangerous than conflict itself, it allows us to see the humanity of others so clearly that their needs and desires matter to us as much as our own. Ford shows dangerous love in action through examples ranging from his work in the Middle East to a deeply moving story about reconciling with his father. He explains why we disconnect from people at the very time we need to be most connected and the predictable patterns of justification and escalation that ensue. Most importantly, he gives us a path to practice dangerous love in the conflicts that matter most to us.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Conflict Resolution"]},{"id":"0130463884","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Advanced DBA Certification Guide and Reference for DB2® Universal Database™ v8 for Linux®, UNIX®, and Windows®","authors":["Dwaine R.

Yet many risk managers do not have a clear understanding of the basics. Requiring no statistical or mathematical background, The Fundamental Rules of Risk Management gives you the knowledge to successfully handle risk in your organization.\n\nThe book begins with a deep investigation into the behavioral roots of risk. Using both historical and contemporary contexts, author Nigel Da Costa Lewis carefully details the indisputable truths surrounding many of the behavioral biases that induce risk. He exposes the fallacy of the wisdom of experts, explains why you cannot rely on regulators, outlines the characteristics of the \"glad game,\" and demonstrates how high intelligence or lack thereof can lead to loss of hard-earned wealth. He also discusses the weaknesses and failures of modern risk management.\n\nMoving on to elements often overlooked by risk managers, Dr. Lewis traces the link between corporate governance and risk management. He then covers core lessons surrounding the role of risk managers as well as the difficult subject of integrated, single lens analysis of risk. The book also explores aspects of spreadsheet risk and draws on lessons learned in the information systems and software engineering communities to provide guidance on selecting the right risk management system. It concludes with a discussion on the most dominant of risk measures—value at risk.\n\nHaving a clear understanding about risk separates successful professionals, companies, and economies from history’s forgotten failures. Through examples and case studies, this thought-provoking book shows how the rules of risk can work to protect and enhance investor value.","tags":["Security","Governance, Risk Management and Compliance (GRC)","Operational Risk"]},{"id":"9781394242221","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Advances in Fuzzy-Based Internet of Medical Things (IoMT)","authors":["Satya Prakash Yadav","Sudesh Yadav","Pethuru Raj"],"pages":"320","publication_date":"April 2024","description":"ADVANCES IN FUZZY-BASED INTERNET OF MEDICAL THINGS (IOMT)\n\nThis book explores the latest trends, transitions, and advancements of the Internet of Medical Things whose integration through cloud-hosted software applications adds required intelligence from tools such as medical instruments, scanners, and appliances, enabling fuzzy logic to help medical professionals establish linguistic concepts in deciding diagnosis and prognosis.\n\nThe main goal of the book is to strengthen medical professionals and caregivers by providing methods for achieving fuzzy logic-based health diagnosis and medication.

This technology is just now being implemented into hardware and working its way into wireless standards such as the ubiquitous 802.11g, as well as third- and fourth-generation cellular standards.\n\nMultiple-Input Multiple-Output Channel Models uniquely brings together the theoretical and practical aspects of MIMO communications, revealing how these systems use their multipath diversity to increase channel capacity. It gives the reader a clear understanding of the underlying propagation mechanisms in the wideband MIMO channel, which is fundamental to the development of communication algorithms, signaling strategies, and transceiver design for MIMO systems.\n\nMIMO channel models are important tools in understanding the potential gains of a MIMO system. This book discusses two types of wideband MIMO models in detail: correlative channel models—specifically the Kronecker, Weichselberger, and structured models—and cluster models, including Saleh-Valenzuela, European Cooperation in the field of Scientific and Technical Research (COST) 273, and Random Cluster models. From simple to complex, the reader will understand the models' mechanisms and the reasons behind the parameters. Next, channel sounding is explained in detail, presenting the theory behind a few channel sounding techniques used to sound narrowband and wideband channels. The technique of digital matched filtering is then examined and, using real-life data, is shown to provide very accurate estimates of channel gains. The book concludes with a performance analysis of the structured and Kronecker models.\n\nMultiple-Input Multiple-Output Channel Models is the first book to apply tensor calculus to the problem of wideband MIMO channel modeling. Each chapter features a list of important references, including core literary references, Matlab implementations of key models, and the location of databases that can be used to help in the development of new models or communication algorithms. Engineers who are working in the development of telecommunications systems will find this resource invaluable, as will researchers and students at the graduate or post-graduate level.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Engineering","Electrical Engineering","Signal Processing"]},{"id":"9781609948375","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"The Truth about Lies in the Workplace","authors":["Carol Kinsey Goman"],"pages":"168","publication_date":"June 2013","description":"Related skill:","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Communication"]},{"id":"9781466572096","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Network Innovation through OpenFlow and SDN","authors":["Fei Hu"],"pages":"520","publication_date":"February 2014","description":"Software-defined networking (SDN) technologies powered by the OpenFlow protocol provide viable options to address the bandwidth needs of next-generation computer networks.

We faithfully separate our waste into different streams, but wonder whether it really makes a difference. Global companies announce their commitment to carbon negativity while simultaneously sponsoring oil conferences. American businesses, communities, and individuals assiduously measure their carbon footprints, then implement voluntary emissions-reduction programs, all while trumpeting their do-gooderism.\n\nThe problem is, none of this—whether individual efforts or corporate sustainability tactics—will make a dent in solving the civilizational threat of climate change. We only pretend it will, at our peril.\n\nAs sustainability veteran Auden Schendler argues in this provocative, powerful book, we're living a big green lie. The hard truth is that much of the modern environmental road map could have been written by the fossil fuel industry specifically to avoid disrupting the status quo. We have become somehow complicit.\n\nBut there is another truth: while ineffective or duplicitous environmentalism has become standard practice, we all have friends and family we love and care about, whose future depends on solving the problem of climate change. Conscience tells us we have an obligation to repair the world. How can our common dreams be so at odds with our daily practice? And how might we meld our spirit and our passion to create a better future?\n\nSchendler meets this profound contradiction head-on—with a bracing critique, moving personal stories of parenthood and service, and innovative, real-world methods to tackle climate change at the corporate, community, and individual levels.\n\nTerrible Beauty is a unique and inspiring call for a new environmentalism, showing us that the key to saving the planet is to tap into our own humanity.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Science","Climate Change"]},{"id":"9781292462134","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Move Up or Move On","authors":["Sergey Gorbatov","Angela Lane"],"pages":"250","publication_date":"April 2024","description":"How to honestly assess your professional career: examine what’s working, and what’s not, and how to identify opportunities to enhance your career edge.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Career Development"]},{"id":"9781118004623","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Boring Meetings Suck: Get More Out of Your Meetings, or Get Out of More Meetings","authors":["Jon Petz"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"April 2011","description":"The guide that proves your meetings don't have to suck!\n\nThere's a big dull elephant in the boardroom: this meeting!

Author Glenn Fleishman, a veteran freelancer, who has spent the last decade working full-time in a home office, solicited advice from dozens of Take Control Books authors, contributors to the Mac publication TidBITS, and friends and acquaintances who have hundreds of years of collective remote work experience.\n\nIf you're like us—Glenn and Take Control Books owners Joe and Morgen—you feel somewhat helpless in the face of forces beyond our control and with no clear path forward, just that there is a path forward. We contributed our time to this book to provide a little light from our experiences and those of many others who donated their tips and observations.\n\nWe welcome your feedback and wish you all the best in managing this transition.\n\nIn this book, you'll learn more about how to:\n\nStake out a physical space, even if it involves setting up a curtain or moving a bookshelf\nPick or adjust a chair if you plan to sit\nFigure out the right mic and headphones or speakers for your needs\nAdd a monitor for efficiency, or use software to turn an iPad or other devices into a second display\nStand while you work without necessarily investing in a new desk\nSet working hours to avoid never being off the clock\nPut up a sign or otherwise signify when you're working to those around you\nInvest a tiny amount or a lot into noise-canceling headphones or earbuds\nUse videoconferencing to replace meetings and casual conversation you miss from an office\nAdjust your expectations and that of your employer to how much work you can produce, initially and in the long haul\nTake regular breaks to avoid burnout, but if you get in the zone, you can stay there, too\nJuggle the simultaneous burdens of full-time home parenting with home working\nRemember to eat lunch","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Communication","Remote Work"]},{"id":"9780134859828","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Applied Three-Dimensional Subsurface Geological Mapping: With Structural Methods, 3rd Edition","authors":["Daniel J.

She has also experienced the system as a patient and as a family member of a critically ill patient. In The Antidote to Suffering, this 30-year healthcare veteran and patient-experience thought leader argues that the key to improving healthcare is to reduce the suffering—physical, psychological, and emotional—of patients and caregivers alike through Compassionate Connected CareTM.\n\nDrawing on her 360-degree perspective, Dempsey offers a comprehensive, detailed, evidence-based plan that addresses the clinical, operational, cultural, and behavioral dimensions of care that every patient and caregiver experiences, in every setting. When suffering decreases, Dempsey argues, outcomes improve for patients and those who care for them. A virtuous cycle takes hold, leading to increases in morale, loyalty, and productivity and results in a culture that drives quality, safety, and value. It paves the path for creating a new national healthcare culture—one that values compassion, fosters efficiency, and drives innovation\n\nThe Antidote to Suffering is the first book to explore the pervasiveness of suffering in our healthcare system, and to provide the strategies and tools to:\n\n* Identify and measure suffering throughout your organization\n\n* Create a system in which every clinical response is informed by compassion\n\n* Operationalize staff behavior to promote meaning and purpose\n\n* Increase productivity by building a culture of collaboration\n\nReducing human suffering isn’t just a moral imperative for healthcare providers.

I was unhappy. I was becoming bitter. I complained about my job a lot. I knew I was in a rut and couldn't figure out what to do about it. I felt powerless, unfocused and alone. And I didn't see a way I could make things improve. That was my starting point before I began the A.I.M. process.\n\n \n\nToday, I run my own firm that helps dozens of nonprofits improve their community impact each year. I work on very interesting and socially relevant projects for an ever-growing roster of clients. I have flown around the world to talk about community building, environmentalism and social marketing. I also teach at an innovative downtown university where the students are a joy to teach and my fellow professors often remark on my enthusiasm for my work and life in general. My friends and family constantly note that I seem happier and more motivated as the years go by.\n\n \n\nThis did not happen because of some exceptional piece of luck - nor because of some superhuman ability or intelligence on my part ... I was someone who happened upon a method - the A.I.M. method - that helped me determine who I was and what inspired me, and then put me on the path to achieving it. It happened because I put those principles into action with the help and guidance of a coach like Jim Carlisle. \n\n \n\nI hope as you read this book that you will appreciate how A.I.M. changed my life - and how it could help you change yours. Jim and I have taken the better part of a year to write this book because we believe in strongly in helping those who need a way out. Every day we see people who would benefit from taking charge of their lives and moving forward to achieve, inspire and make a difference.\n\n \n\nIf you see a bit of yourself in my story - or in the dozens of stories we will share in this book - read on.

Over the past 25 years, Value at Risk (VaR) became the common universal standard in risk measurement. However, the financial crisis of 2007/2009 clearly demonstrated great discrepancies in risk estimates based on this indicator. In this report, three of the field’s leading experts objectively consider each key criticism of VaR in recent professional literature, including VaR’s underestimation of the magnitude and frequency of extreme outcomes, the difficulty of obtaining reliable VaR estimates for complex portfolios, the limited value of historical data, imperfections in the effective market hypothesis that underlies VaR, and several more. Next, the authors carefully review refinements and alternatives that have been proposed as potential replacements or complements, including Conditional VaR (Expected Shortfall), Shock VaR, modifications in the handling of parameters uncertainty, liquidity adjustment, higher moments, and more. They conclude by discussing why a sound risk management system continues to require deep understanding of complex adaptive and often irrational market mechanisms and still cannot be reduced to a mere combination of indicators, no matter how sophisticated they are.","tags":["Security","Governance, Risk Management and Compliance (GRC)","Operational Risk"]},{"id":"9780444530356","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Parallel Computational Fluid Dynamics 2006","authors":["Jang-Hyuk Kwon","Jacques Periaux","Pat Fox"],"pages":"318","publication_date":"September 2007","description":"The proceedings from Parallel CFD 2006 covers all aspects of parallel computings and its applications.

Member-serving association boards may be especially challenged by their more complex affiliate structures and a greater emphasis on representative governance. But what does the journey to good governance look like? Markedly different from existing board development books, this modern approach focuses less on the behaviors and qualities of \"high-performing boards\" and more on the stages and processes that directors and their staff used to transform their boards. Based on research funded by the ASAE Foundation, the book fills a gap in the governance literature by emphasizing diagnosis and problem solving, using the actual tools and activities implemented by 85 transformed associations. Combining the credibility of scholarly research with lively and compelling stories, tools, and teachable moments, this book is designed to help associations and other nonprofit organizations achieve the entire journey to good governance, from first to last steps.","tags":["Security","Governance, Risk Management and Compliance (GRC)","Governance"]},{"id":"9781466591912","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Expert Bytes","authors":["Vlad Atanasiu"],"pages":"208","publication_date":"September 2013","description":"This volume introduces computer scientists and forensic document examiners to the computer expertise of forensic documents and assists them with the design of research projects in this interdisciplinary field.

The text presents the main peculiarities of the Italian corporate governance system, its impact on decision-making in corporate boardrooms, and the potential positive and negative consequences for the firm and its stakeholders. Several real-life case studies were included to help the reader grasp the subtleties of how power is exercised in Italian companies. The authors combine their knowledge of research with their professional experience. Such an approach helps the reader interpret the nuances of corporate governance practices in Italian companies as those practices are driven not only by the globalization of markets, but also by national economic, social, and political forces. The result is a unique corporate governance system, which deeply differs from the Anglo-American one. This book is, therefore, particularly relevant for a wide international audience (including investors, corporate directors, scholars, and practitioners) as it provides useful insights to interpret, evaluate and take sound decisions in Italian companies.","tags":["Security","Governance, Risk Management and Compliance (GRC)","Governance"]},{"id":"9780596510213","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Lead Generation on the Web","authors":["Thomas Myer"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"February 2007","description":"Are you a small-business owner, consultant, or marketing manager for a big company selling an intangible service or hard-to-understand product?

Since 1992, the UNFCCC and its Kyoto Protocol has been the primary legal instrument to respond to the climate challenge. However, the intergovernmental process has been riddled with problems that have rendered it ineffective. The changing economic landscape has further made this country grouping problematic as some developing countries now emit more than some of their advanced counterparts. Such problems have crippled the existing regime in adequately addressing climate change.\n\nBuilding upon the expertise of the contributors of this volume, this ground-breaking collection aims to show the way forward for the intergovernmental process. It is the first of its kind to explore the key features of the regime, featuring meticulously researched pieces from leading experts in the field. Each chapter responds to the questions surrounding the political and structural limitations of the current top-down approach taken in climate negotiations and proposes various alternatives countries can take to overcome such limitations in the process of building the post-2020 climate change regime. In particular, this collection underscores the concept of low-carbon development and green growth to make the climate change regime more effective.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Science","Climate Change"]},{"id":"9780128041963","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Securing Social Media in the Enterprise","authors":["Henry Dalziel"],"pages":"48","publication_date":"August 2015","description":"Securing Social Media in the Enterprise is a concise overview of the security threats posed by the use of social media sites and apps in enterprise network environments.

Decision makers at all levels are required to manage the consequences of complexity every day. They must deal with problems that arise unexpectedly, generate uncertainty, are characterised by interconnectivity, and spread across traditional boundaries. Simple solutions to complex problems are usually inadequate and risk exacerbating the original issues.\n\nLeaders of international bodies such as the UN, OECD, UNESCO and WHO — and of major business, public sector, charitable, and professional organizations — have all declared that systems thinking is an essential leadership skill for managing the complexity of the economic, social and environmental issues that confront decision makers. Systems thinking must be implemented more generally, and on a wider scale, to address these issues.\n\nAn evaluation of different systems methodologies suggests that they concentrate on different aspects of complexity. To be in the best position to deal with complexity, decision makers must understand the strengths and weaknesses of the various approaches and learn how to employ them in combination. This is called critical systems thinking. Making use of over 25 case studies, the book offers an account of the development of systems thinking and of major efforts to apply the approach in real-world interventions. Further, it encourages the widespread use of critical systems practice as a means of ensuring responsible leadership in a complex world.\n\nComments on a previous version of the book:\n\nRuss Ackoff: ‘the book is the best overview of the field I have seen’\n\nJP van Gigch: ‘Jackson does a masterful job.

You will understand the problems in existing designs, know how to make small modifications to correct those problems, and learn to apply the principles of immutable architecture to your tools.\nMost software components focus on the state of objects. They store the current state of a row in a relational database. They track changes to state over time, making several basic assumptions: there is a single latest version of each object, the state of an object changes sequentially, and a system of record exists.\nThis is a challenge when it comes to building distributed systems. Whether dealing with autonomous microservices or disconnected mobile apps, many of the problems we try to solve come down to synchronizing an ever-changing state between isolated components. Distributed systems would be a lot easier to build if objects could not change.\nAfter reading The Art of Immutable Architecture, you will come away with an understanding of the benefits of using immutable objects in your own distributed systems. You will learn a set of rules for identifying and exchanging immutable objects, and see a collection of useful theorems that emerges and ensures that the distributed systems you build are eventually consistent. Using patterns, you will find where the truth converges, see how changes are associative, rather than sequential, and come to feel comfortable understanding that there is no longer a single source of truth. Practical hands-on examples reinforce how to build software using the described patterns, techniques, and tools. By the end of the book, you will possess the language and resources needed to analyze and construct distributed systems with confidence.\nThe assumptions of the past were sufficient for building single-user, single-computer systems. But aswe expand to multiple devices, shared experiences, and cloud computing, they work against us. It is time for a new set of assumptions. Start with immutable objects, and build better distributed systems.\n\nWhat You Will Learn\nEvaluate a distributed system from the perspective of immutable objects \nRecognize the problems in existing designs, and make small modifications to correct them\nStart a new system from scratch, applying patterns\nApply the principles of immutable architecture to your tools, including SQL databases, message queues, and the network protocols that you already use \nDiscover new tools that natively apply these principles \nWho This Book Is For\nSoftware architects and senior developers. It contains examples in SQL and languages such as JavaScript and C#.

As a spouse? A parent? A Little League baseball coach or behind the bench of a minor hockey team?\n\nWhat does it take to get ahead? To separate yourself from the competition? To lead a less stressful and happier existence? To be fulfilled in personal and professional pursuits?\n\nWhat is the most important dynamic of your makeup? Is it your A) intelligence quotient? or B) emotional quotient?\n\nIf you picked \"A\", you are partly correct. Your intelligence quotient can be a predictor of things such as academic achievement. But your IQ is fixed and unchangeable. The real key to personal and professional growth is your emotional intelligence quotient, which you can nurture and develop by learning more about EQ from the international bestseller The EQ Edge.\n\nAuthors Steven J. Stein and Howard E. Book show you how the dynamic of emotional intelligence works. By understanding EQ, you can build more meaningful relationships, boost your confidence and optimism, and respond to challenges with enthusiasm-all of which are essential ingredients of success.\n\nThe EQ Edge offers fascinating-and sometimes surprising-insights into what it takes to be a top law-enforcement officer, lawyer, school principal, student, doctor, dentist or CEO. You will learn what the top EQ factors are across many different kinds of jobs, from business managers and customer service representatives to HR professionals and public servants.\n\nThe EQ Edge will help you determine which personnel are the right fit for job opportunities and who among your staff are the most promising leaders and drivers of your business. And because all of us have other roles-parent, spouse, caregiver to aging parents, neighbor, friend-The EQ Edge also describes how everyone can be more successful in these relationships.\n\n\"Finally, a practical and usable guide to what emotional intelligence is all about. This book peels the onion on what EQ really is and teaches the reader to assess their own EQ and how to increase it.

But can you also build web sites that are usable by machines? That's where the future lies, and that's what RESTful Web Services shows you how to do. The World Wide Web is the most popular distributed application in history, and Web services and mashups have turned it into a powerful distributed computing platform.

Yet they can consistently deliver value to a business and remain under control.\n\nExtreme Programming (XP) was conceived and developed to address the specific needs of software development conducted by small teams in the face of vague and changing requirements. This new lightweight methodology challenges many conventional tenets, including the long-held assumption that the cost of changing a piece of software necessarily rises dramatically over the course of time. XP recognizes that projects have to work to achieve this reduction in cost and exploit the savings once they have been earned.\n\nFundamentals of XP include:\n\nDistinguishing between the decisions to be made by business interests and those to be made by project stakeholders.\n\nWriting unit tests before programming and keeping all of the tests running at all times.\n\nIntegrating and testing the whole system--several times a day.\n\nProducing all software in pairs, two programmers at one screen.\n\nStarting projects with a simple design that constantly evolves to add needed flexibility and remove unneeded complexity.\n\nPutting a minimal system into production quickly and growing it in whatever directions prove most valuable.\n\nWhy is XP so controversial? Some sacred cows don't make the cut in XP:\n\nDon't force team members to specialize and become analysts, architects, programmers, testers, and integrators--every XP programmer participates in all of these critical activities every day.\n\nDon't conduct complete up-front analysis and design--an XP project starts with a quick analysis of the entire system, and XP programmers continue to make analysis and design decisions throughout development.\n\nDevelop infrastructure and frameworks as you develop your application, not up-front--delivering business value is the heartbeat that drives XP projects.\n\nDon't write and maintain implementation documentation--communication in XP projects occurs face-to-face, or through efficient tests and carefully written code.\n\nYou may love XP, or you may hate it, but Extreme Programming Explained will force you to take a fresh look at how you develop software.\n\n0201616416B04062001","tags":["Software Development","Software Collaboration","Extreme Programming"]},{"id":"9780135987438","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Creating Agile Organizations: A Systemic Approach","authors":["Ilia Pavlichenko","Cesario Ramos"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"September 2022","description":"Design Your Organization for Maximum Agile Success at Scale\n\n\"[A] unique view of organizational agility.

As a professional in the business world, you care about doing your job the right way. The quality of your work matters to you, both as a professional and as a person. The company you work for cares about making money and your boss is evaluated on that basis. Sometimes those goals overlap, but the different priorities mean conflict is inevitable. Take concrete steps to build a relationship with your manager that helps both sides succeed.\n\nGuide your manager to treat you as a vital member of the team who should be kept as happy and productive as possible.\n\nWhen your manager insists on a course of action you don't like, most employees feel they have only two options: you can swallow your objections, or you can leave. Neither option gets you what you want, which is for your manager to consider your interests when making decisions. Challenging your boss directly is risky, but if you understand what really matters to your manager, you can build a balanced relationship that works for both sides.\n\nProvide timely \"good enough\" answers that satisfy the immediate need of the boss to move forward. Use a productive solution to the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma to structure your interactions with management, going along when necessary and pushing back where appropriate, without threatening the loyalty relationship. Send the two most important messages to your boss: \"I got this\" and \"I got your back,\" to prove your value to the boss and the organization. Analyze your manager's communication preferences so you can express your arguments in a way most likely to be heard and understood. Avoid key traps, like thinking of the boss as your friend or violating the chain of command unnecessarily.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Career Development"]},{"id":"9780124158207","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Investment Banks, Hedge Funds, and Private Equity, 2nd Edition","authors":["David Stowell"],"pages":"672","publication_date":"September 2012","description":"The dynamic environment of investment banks, hedge funds, and private equity firms comes to life in David Stowell’s introduction to the ways they challenge and sustain each other.

Ever since I came across it Applying UML and Patterns has been my unreserved choice.\" —Martin Fowler, author, UML Distilled and Refactoring\n\nThe first edition of Applying UML and Patterns: An Introduction to Object-Oriented Analysis and Design quickly emerged as the leading OOA/D introduction; it has been translated into seven languages and adopted in universities and businesses worldwide. In this second edition, well-known object technology and iterative methods leader Craig Larman refines and expands this text for developers and students new to OOA/D, the UML, patterns, use cases, iterative development, and related topics.\n\nPut simply, the book shows newcomers to OOA/D how to \"think in objects.\" It does so by presenting three iterations of a single, cohesive case study, incrementally introducing the requirements and OOA/D activities, principles, and patterns that are most critical to success. It introduces the most frequently used UML diagramming notation, while emphasizing that OOA/D is much more than knowing UML notation. All case study iterations and skills are presented in the context of an \"agile\" version of the Unified Process -- a popular, modern iterative approach to software development. Throughout, Larman presents the topics in a fashion designed for learning and comprehension.\n\nAmong the topics introduced in Applying UML and Patterns are: * requirements and use cases, * domain object modeling, * core UML, * designing objects with responsibilities, * \"Gang of Four\" and other design patterns, * mapping designs to code (using Java as an example), * layered architectures, * architectural analysis, * package design, * iterative development, and * the Unified Process. For a more detailed list of topics, please see the accompanying table of contents.\n\nForeword by Philippe Kruchten, the lead architect of the Rational Unified Process.\n\n\"Too few people have a knack for explaining things. Fewer still have a handle on software analysis and design.

He passionately believes that one hour spent with an end user is worth many hours making software architectural choices or days documenting perceived user requirements. Most of what is written about software development focuses on methods used to design and develop robust software. Luke’s latest effort, Beyond Software Architecture, illuminates the more mundane aspects of creating true business solutions by supporting the user throughout the lifecycle of the software product. By concerning himself with creating business value, Luke tightens the connection between a software application and the business function it performs.”\n\n         &#8212Bruce Bourbon              General Partner, Telos Venture Partners\n\n“There are two kinds of people that read the Dilbert comic strip: folks that take a moment to marvel at how accurately it reflects life at their company before moving on to the next comic strip, and folks that think Dilbert is an amusing reminder that high tech companies can and should be better than Dilbert’s world. Anyone in the first group should stick to reading comics. This book is for people in the latter group.”\n\n         —Tony Navarrete              Vice President, Diamondhead Ventures\n\n“Luke brings a proven methodology to the challenge of software development. In Beyond Software Architecture, Luke provides practical and proven techniques that all development executives can employ to improve the productivity of their software organization.”\n\n         —G. Bradford Solso              CEO, Taviz Technology\n\n“Beyond Software Architecture is the first book I have read which contains an insider’s perspective of both the business and technical facets of software architecture. This is a great book to get marketers and software managers on the same page!”\n\n         &#8212Damon Schechter              CEO, LOC Global              author of Delivering the Goods\n\n“There are books on technical architecture and books on product marketing, but few, if any, on how architecture and marketing information must be integrated for world class product development. Beyond Software Architecture provides this valuable bridge between technology and marketing&#8212it explains how to deliver quality products that are profitable in the marketplace.”\n\n         &#8212Jim Highsmith              Director, Cutter Consortium              author of Adaptive Software Development\n\n“Product development managers, marketing managers, architects, and technical leads from all functions should read this book. You’ll see a pragmatic view of how to define and use a product architecture throughout a project’s lifecycle and a product's lifetime.”\n\n         &#8212Johanna Rothman              Rothman Consulting Group, Inc.\n\n“Luke Hohmann has captured the essence of product creation in his latest book. He cleverly discusses the need for both the marketing and engineering roles in product creation and ties the two together building a good foundation for understanding and executing successful product creation.”\n\n         &#8212Lee Sigler              Principal, 360 Market View, Inc.\n\n“Finally a book that deals with those often ignored but critical operational issues like licensing, deployment, installation, configuration and support. Beyond Software Architecture is the “What they don't teach you at Harvard Business School” book for anyone who develops software products&#8212or buys them.”\n\n         &#8212Mary Poppendieck              Managing Director, Agile Alliance              President, Poppendieck LLC\n\n“Luke Hohmann delivers a passionate, articulate wake-up call to software architects: it ain’t just technical any more! Technical architectures have profound business ramifications, and ignoring the business ramifications of portability, usability, configuration, upgrade and release management, security, and other architectural choices can not only lead to project failures, but ultimately to nasty lawsuits from disappointed customers. Beyond Software Architecture is a must-read for successful software product managers!”\n\n         &#8212Ed Yourdon              Author of numerous books and articles on software development\n\n“Beyond Software Architecture is not just for software engineering professionals! Executives and product managers will find that the book provides the necessary background to make informed decisions about the software that their companies build. I have found that the book is a useful tool for building consensus between management and engineering, because it discusses business and customer-related issues without delving too deeply into implementation details.”\n\n         &#8212David Chaiken              Vice President, Systems Architecture              AgileTV Corporation\n\n“Product marketing influences product architecture. This shouldn’t be a surprise, yet most texts on software architecture are silent on this fact. This may be because we lack the language for distinguishing between the technical aspects of an architecture and the marketing aspects. Beyond Software Architecture provides the language to draw this important distinction, and provides strategies for overall architectural success.”\n\n         &#8212Dave W. Smith\n\n“Beyond Software Architecture, as the title implies, successfully addresses the often neglected aspects of developing total solutions. Hohmann demonstrates both passion and depth for the broad set of topics discussed.”\n\n         &#8212Craig Priess              Director Product Management, Resonant Software\n\n“Looking through my technical library, it’s apparent that many books are obsolete, casualties of technical innovation and change. There are a few, however, that remain and continue to be relevant. Adding Luke Hohmann’s new book, Beyond Software Architecture: Creating and Sustaining Winning Solutions expands that selection and fills an important gap.

In Event-Driven Architecture, four leading IT innovators present both the theory of EDA and practical, step-by-step guidance to implementing it successfully.\n\nThe authors first establish a thorough and workable definition of EDA and explore how EDA can help solve many of today’s most difficult business and IT challenges. You’ll learn how EDAs work, what they can do today, and what they might be able to do as they mature. You’ll learn how to determine whether an EDA approach makes sense in your environment and how to overcome the difficult interoperability and integration issues associated with successful deployment.

Unfortunately, attackers have grown more nimble and effective, meaning that traditional security programs are no longer effective.\n\nToday's effective cyber security programs take these best practices and overlay them with intelligence. Adding cyber threat intelligence can help security teams uncover events not detected by traditional security platforms and correlate seemingly disparate events across the network. Properly-implemented intelligence also makes the life of the security practitioner easier by helping him more effectively prioritize and respond to security incidents.\n\nThe problem with current efforts is that many security practitioners don't know how to properly implement an intelligence-led program, or are afraid that it is out of their budget. Building an Intelligence-Led Security Program is the first book to show how to implement an intelligence-led program in your enterprise on any budget. It will show you how to implement a security information a security information and event management system, collect and analyze logs, and how to practice real cyber threat intelligence.

It goes on to explain the notion of provable security, which formally defines what \"secure\" means in terms of a cryptographic scheme. A selection of famous families of protocols are then described, including zero-knowledge proofs, multi-party computation and key exchange.\n\nAfter a general introduction to pairing-based cryptography, this book presents advanced cryptographic schemes for confidentiality and authentication with additional properties such as anonymous signatures and multi-recipient encryption schemes.

In relation to others, and in relation to the past? Commonly associated with the ideas of benchmarking and baselining, comparative assessment is an important part of organizational management, but this broadly defined undertaking lacks clear conceptual framing and methodological foundations. At the same time, the readily available transactional data make robust tracking and measurement possible at an unprecedented scale, but also accentuate the impact of assessment paradox: To be truly meaningful, exact magnitudes-expressed values often need to be ‘translated’ into qualitative, assessment-laden categories, but that task is impeded by lack of established approaches for doing so.\n\nInspired by these observations, Probabilistic Benchmarking frames the notions of benchmarking and baselining as two complementary but distinct mechanisms of comparative assessment that make use of informational contents of organizational data to contribute unbiased, systematic, and consistent evaluation of outcomes or states of interest. In that general context, this book provides much-needed conceptual and methodological clarity to guide construction and use of benchmarks and baselines, and re-casts the idea of assessment standards in the context of data-derived estimates, to better align the practice of comparative assessment with the emerging realities of the Age of Data.\n\nThis pioneering research-based but application-minded book bridges the gap between theory and practice.

Feeling burned out at work, unfulfilled, or just plain unhappy with whatever we're doing, we long to reinvent ourselves on a new and different career path. But how do we make this transition successfully?\n\nIn this update of the groundbreaking classic, bestselling author Herminia Ibarra presents a model for career reinvention that flies in the face of everything we've learned from \"career experts\"—and is tailor-made for changing careers in today's uncertain world. Career transition is not a linear path toward some predetermined identity, according to Ibarra, but a crooked journey along which we try on a host of \"possible selves\" we might become. Successful reinvention comes not from deciphering and analyzing our past, but from inventing and testing our possible futures.\n\nUsing new examples of people in different stages of a career transition, Ibarra identifies the three critical strategies—experiment with new professional activities and identities, interact in new networks of people, and make sense of what is happening to us in light of emerging possibilities—that all successful career changers use. She shows how you can use these strategies to:\n\nExplore your possible selves\nCraft and execute \"identity experiments\"\nCreate \"small wins\" that keep momentum going\nConnect with role models and mentors who can ease the transition\nArrange new learnings into a coherent story\n\nNow with action-oriented exercises to help you work successfully through your own career transition, this updated edition gives you the tools to discover a new path and find success in your new career.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Development"]},{"id":"9781118138502","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Private Equity, 2nd Edition","authors":["Harry Cendrowski","Louis W.

Considerable emphasis is also given to the key controls and the importance of control functions, audit and risk management groups and policy. Case studies are used to effectively demonstrate 'success' and 'failure'. In the financial services industry risk is a constant threat to organizations of all sizes and to the markets themselves. Many industry 'events' have shown how dangerous it is when a business operates in an uncontrolled way, particularly when the lack of control was not evident to the management of the business until it was too late.Controls, procedures and risk are occupying more and more management time. The responsibility to manage the risks lies with the whole operations team. If it is successful in fulfilling this role the overall risk of the business is reduced, if it is not successful the consequences may be severe.In this book the author has deliberately focussed on the practical side of risk, controls and procedures, rather than analyse the Basel Capital Accord and the capital requirements etc.(however, the Accord and updates are contained in the Appendices). Operations teams need to be aware of risk but not overwhelmed by it. Risk management within, and by, the operations function is the focus of this book. From day-to-day risk to wider risk implications the operations function is reviewed to show the sources and implications of risk situations.

Is it time to get a new job? Which job candidate should I hire? What business strategy should I pursue?We spend the majority of our lives making decisions, both big and small. Yet, even though our success is largely determined by the choices that we make, very few of us are equipped with useful decision-making skills. Because of this, we often approach our choices tentatively, or even fearfully, and avoid giving them the time and thought required to put our best foot forward.In Smart Choices, John Hammond, Ralph Keeney, and Howard Raiffaexperts with over 100 years of experience resolving complex decision problemsoffer a proven, straightforward, and flexible roadmap for making better and more impactful decisions, and offer the tools to achieve your goals in every aspect of your life.Their step-by-step, divide-and conquer approach will teach you how to: Evaluate your plans Break your potential decision into its key elements Identify the key drivers that are most relevant to your goals Apply systematic thinking Use the right information to make the smartest choiceSmart Choices doesn’t tell you what to decide; it tells you how. As you routinely use the process, you’ll become more confident in your ability to make decisions at work and at home.

You’re not alone.That’s the bad news. But there is something we can do about it. Heidi Grant Halvorson, social psychologist and bestselling author, explains why we’re often misunderstood and how we can fix that.Most of us assume that other people see us as we see ourselves, and that they see us as we truly are. But neither is true. Our everyday interactions are colored by subtle biases that distort how others see usand also shape our perceptions of them.You can learn to clarify the message you’re sending once you understand the lenses that shape perception: Trust. Are you friend or foe? Power. How much influence do you have over me? Ego. Do you make me feel insecure?Based on decades of research in psychology and social science, Halvorson explains how these lenses affect our interactionsand how to manage them.Once you understand the science of perception, you’ll communicate more clearly, send the messages you intend to send, and improve your personal relationships. You’ll also become a fairer and more accurate judge of others. Halvorson even offers an evidence-based action plan for repairing a damaged reputation.This book is not about making a good impression, although it will certainly help you do that.

Since the advent of computer networking and high speed data transmission technology people have been striving to develop faster and more reliable communications media. Optical pulses tend to broaden over relatively short distances due to dispersion, but solitons on the other hand are not as susceptible to the effects of dispersion, and although they are subject to losses due to attenuation they can be amplified without being received and re-transmitted.This book is the first to provide a thorough overview of optical solitons. The main purpose of this book is to present the rapidly developing field of Spatial Optical Solitons starting from the basic concepts of light self-focusing and self-trapping. It will introduce the fundamental concepts of the theory of nonlinear waves and solitons in non-integrated but physically realistic models of nonlinear optics including their stability and dynamics. Also, it will summarize a number of important experimental verification of the basic theoretical predictions and concepts covering the observation of self-focusing in the earlier days of nonlinear optics and the most recent experimental results on spatial solitons, vortex solitons, and soliton interaction & spiraling.* Introduces the fundamental concepts of the theory of nonlinear waves and solitons through realistic models * Material is based on authors' years of experience actively working in and researching the field* Summarizes the most important experimental verification of the basic theories, predictions and concepts of this ever evolving field from the earliest studies to the most recent","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Science","Physics","Optics"]},{"id":"9781482214123","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Introduction to Computer and Network Security","authors":["Richard R.

A continuation of the popular Frequency Synthesis by Phase Lock, Second Edition, this timely resource provides a broad introduction to sigma-delta by pairing practical simulation results with cutting-edge research. Advanced Frequency Synthesis by Phase Lock discusses both sigma-delta and fractional-n—the still-in-use forerunner to sigma-delta—employing Simulink® models and detailed simulations of results to promote a deeper understanding.\n\nAfter a brief introduction, the book shows how spurs are produced at the synthesizer output by the basic process and different methods for overcoming them. It investigates how various defects in sigma-delta synthesis contribute to spurs or noise in the synthesized signal. Synthesizer configurations are analyzed, and it is revealed how to trade off the various noise sources by choosing loop parameters. Other sigma-delta synthesis architectures are then reviewed.\n\nThe Simulink simulation models that provided data for the preceding discussions are described, providing guidance in making use of such models for further exploration. Next, another method for achieving wide loop bandwidth simultaneously with fine resolution—the Diophantine Frequency Synthesizer—is introduced. Operation at extreme bandwidths is also covered, further describing the analysis of synthesizers that push their bandwidths close to the sampling-frequency limit. Lastly, the book reviews a newly important technology that is poised to become widely used in high-production consumer electronics—all-digital frequency synthesis.\n\nDetailed appendices provide in-depth discussion on various stages of development, and many related resources are available for download, including Simulink models, MATLAB® scripts, spreadsheets, and executable programs.

Theresa Breining","Jack J. Phillips"],"pages":"304","publication_date":"January 2008","description":"The Phillips ROI Methodology™ utilizes five levels of evaluation, which are essential in determining the return on investment.\n\nAt Level 1 - Reaction and Planned Action, attendee and stakeholder satisfaction from the meeting can be measured. Almost all organizations evaluate at Level 1, usually with a generic, end-of-meeting questionnaire. While this level of evaluation is important as a “stakeholder” satisfaction measure, a favorable reaction does not ensure that attendees have acquired new skills, knowledge, opinions or attitudes from the meeting.\n\nAt Level 2 - Learning, measurements focus on what participants learned during the meeting using tests, skill practices, role-plays, simulations, group evaluations, and other assessment tools. A learning check is helpful to ensure that attendees have absorbed the meeting material or messages and know how to use or apply it properly. It is also important at this level to determine the quantity and quality of new professional contacts acquired and whether existing professional contacts were strengthened due to the meeting. However, a positive measure at this level is no guarantee that what was learned or whether the professional contacts acquired will be used on the job.\n\nAt Level 3 - Job Applications, a variety of follow-up methods can be used to determine if attendees applied on the job what they learned or acquired at the meeting. The frequency and use of skills are important measures at Level 3. While Level 3 evaluations are important to gauge the success of the meeting, it still does not guarantee that there will be a positive business impact in the organization or for the attendee.\n\nAt Level 4 - Business Results, the measurement focuses on the actual business results achieved by meeting participants as they successfully apply the meeting material or messages. Typical Level 4 measures include output, sales, quality, costs, time and customer satisfaction. Although the meeting may produce a measurable business impact, there is still a concern that the meeting may cost too much.\n\nAt Level 5 - Return on Investment, this ultimate level of measurement compares the monetary benefits from the meeting with the fully-loaded meeting costs as expressed in the ROI formula.\n\nAll levels of evaluation must be conducted in order to determine the ROI of a meeting or event. The data collected should show a chain of impact occurring through the levels as the skills and knowledge learned (Level 2) are applied on the job (Level 3) to produce business results (Level 4).","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Communication","Meetings"]},{"id":"9781597491990","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Dr. Tom Shinder's ISA Server 2006 Migration Guide","authors":["Thomas W Shinder"],"pages":"672","publication_date":"April 2011","description":"Dr. Tom Shinder’s ISA Server 2006 Migration Guide provides a clear, concise, and thorough path to migrate from previous versions of ISA Server to ISA Server 2006.

If you’re one of them, The Scrum Field Guide will give you skills and confidence to adopt Scrum more rapidly, more successfully, and with far less pain and fear. Long-time Scrum practitioner Mitch Lacey identifies major challenges associated with early-stage Scrum adoption, as well as deeper issues that emerge after companies have adopted Scrum, and describes how other organizations have overcome them. You’ll learn how to gain “quick wins” that build support, and then use the flexibility of Scrum to maximize value creation across the entire process.\n\nIn 30 brief, engaging chapters, Lacey guides you through everything from defining roles to setting priorities to determining team velocity, choosing a sprint length, and conducting customer reviews. Along the way, he explains why Scrum can seem counterintuitive, offers a solid grounding in the core agile concepts that make it work, and shows where it can (and shouldn’t) be modified. Coverage includes\n\nGetting teams on board, and bringing new team members aboard after you’ve started\n\nCreating a “definition of done” for the team and organization\n\nImplementing the strong technical practices that are indispensable for agile success\n\nBalancing predictability and adaptability in release planning\n\nKeeping defects in check\n\nRunning productive daily standup meetings\n\nKeeping people engaged with pair programming\n\nManaging culture clashes on Scrum teams\n\nPerforming “emergency procedures” to get sprints back on track\n\nEstablishing a pace your team can truly sustain\n\nAccurately costing projects, and measuring the value they deliver\n\nDocumenting Scrum projects effectively\n\nPrioritizing and estimating large backlogs\n\nIntegrating outsourced and offshored components\n\nPacked with real-world examples from Lacey’s own experience, this book is invaluable to everyone transitioning to agile: developers, architects, testers, managers, and project owners alike.","tags":["Software Development","Software Collaboration","Agile","Scrum"]},{"id":"9781118417058","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Web Application Defender's Cookbook","authors":["Ryan C.

Safety experts emphasize the cautionary principle, stating that in the face of uncertainty, caution should be the dominant standard. On the other hand, relying on economic assessment often leads to decisions made using expected values to optimize return on investment. Safety Risk Management: Integrating Economic and Safety Perspectives aims to illuminate this dichotomy while debating important questions. For example, is ‘safety always first?’ Additionally, in many risk environments only partial knowledge is available and limited emphasis may be mistakenly given to uncertainty.\n\nRisk management deals with balancing the dilemma inherent in exploring opportunities on the one hand, and avoiding losses, accidents, and disasters, on the other. Safety Risk Management: Integrating Economic and Safety Perspectives comprises a collection of work in this field with special focus given to situations with the potential for substantial reward but also with the possibility of immense losses and extreme consequences.\n\nThis book aims to contribute to clarifying the problem by proposing an appropriate basis for managing risk to meet related practical challenges.

For others, it seems like a foreign language they'll never learn – until now. Rob Jolles delivers down-to-earth solutions for anyone looking to enhance the most basic need of all; to be believed. He leverages his over 30 years of experience to equip readers with empowering and practical tools for achieving business and social success. Jolles argues that credibility is as much about attitude as it is about aptitude. So-called “soft skills” like pitch, pace, and tone of voice, are actually some of the most crucial factors in determining how people perceive us. As he puts it, “it's not the words, it's the tune” that really makes us memorable and credible. This book is about finding the necessary magic to help others believe you. It requires an unshakable belief in yourself, so Jolles starts there. With that as a solid foundation, you can move on to the specific tactics and practices that will make you credible and convincing. But these can be tough to practice in the face of the inevitable setbacks we all face, so he also offers advice on maintaining courage and confidence when doubt naturally creeps in. And he concludes with a discussion of sustaining your newfound credibility for the long haul. There isn't a soul on earth who hasn't questioned themselves at some point. And most of us are just one or two brutal rejections away from questioning all that we are. Why People Don't Believe You helps readers cultivate a robust mental framework and a set of what Jolles calls “performance skills” to tackle these doubts. You are good enough –and after reading this stirring book, you'll be ready to make the world believe that as well.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Communication"]},{"id":"9781466587526","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Tracking Control of Linear Systems","authors":["Lyubomir T.

With this framework, he introduces the reader to crucial concepts in signal processing such as continuous- and discrete-domain signals and systems, discrete-domain periodic signals, sampling and reconstruction, light and color, random field models, image representation and more. \n\nWhile most treatments use normalized representations for non-rectangular sampling, this approach obscures much of the geometrical and scale information of the signal. In contrast, Dr. Dubois uses actual units of space-time and frequency. Basis-independent representations appear as much as possible, and the basis is introduced where needed to perform calculations or implementations. Thus, lattice theory is developed from the beginning and rectangular sampling is treated as a special case. This is especially significant in the treatment of color and color image processing and for discrete transform representations based on symmetry groups, including fast computational algorithms. Other features include:\n\nAn entire chapter on lattices, giving the reader a thorough grounding in the use of lattices in signal processing\nExtensive treatment of lattices as used to describe discrete-domain signals and signal periodicities\nChapters on sampling and reconstruction, random field models, symmetry invariant signals and systems and multidimensional Fourier transformation properties\nSupplemented throughout with MATLAB examples and accompanying downloadable source code\n\nGraduate and doctoral students as well as senior undergraduates and professionals working in signal processing or video/image processing and imaging will appreciate this fresh approach to multidimensional signals and systems theory, both as a thorough introduction to the subject and as inspiration for future research.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Engineering","Electrical Engineering","Signal Processing"]},{"id":"9780730308683","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"How to Succeed in 12 Months: Creating a Life You Love","authors":["Serena Star-Leonard"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"July 2014","description":"Step into the more fabulous version of your life\n\nThink about where you are in life right at this moment.

The focus of such networks is usually on developing, distributing and applying knowledge. For-profit and nonprofit organizations of all sizes are seizing on this model to learn more quickly and collaborate productively. However, for every successful network, others have lost steam due to poor participation, goal ambiguity, mixed allegiances or technology mismatches. The authors sought to better understand the leverage that network leaders have. Their initial research, funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, focused on how knowledge networks could improve the spread of evidence about childhood and maternal nutrition. The authors used that research to develop a model of knowledge networks and later validated that model in organizations outside the international health space. In that process, they developed case studies of ConocoPhillips, the world’s largest independent exploration and production oil company, and Women’s World Banking, a global nonprofit operating in 28 countries.The authors identified eight network design dimensions that leaders of knowledge networks shouldconsider:1. Leaders’ Shared Theory of Change Successful knowledge network leaders can describe the mechanisms through which network activities will have an impact on members and organizations.2. Objectives/Outcomes/Purpose Leaders help to define the network’s purpose and target outcomes.3. Role of Expertise and Experimentation (also called the expert-learner duality) Leaders need to be clear on how the network makes it safe for even the expert to be vulnerable and learn and for the learner to speak of bold possibilities.4. Inclusion and Participation The networks’ core team explicitly defines what types of members they seek and actively recruits them.5. Operating Model Knowledge network leaders decide what roles, responsibilities and decision processes are needed for optimal network operations.6. Convening Structures and Infrastructures Network leaders understand how online and real-time or live convenings serve to build cohesion, connectivity, collaboration and engagement.7. Facilitation and Social Norm Development Knowledge network leaders take on the roles of facilitators and change agents, not just project managers. They convene members in meetings, discussions, games, events and other interactions.8. Measurement, Feedback and Incentives Network leaders look for evidence of success or failure in network participation, as well as ways to incentivize people to join, participate and engage.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Communication","Collaboration"]},{"id":"0789731487","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Absolute Beginner's Guide to Microsoft® Office OneNote™ 2003","authors":["Patricia Cardoza"],"pages":"384","publication_date":"April 2004","description":"Absolute Beginner's Guide to Microsoft Office OneNote 2003 is a from-scratch reference that helps you get up to speed quickly on this new note taking and management program.

Instead of offering do and don't lists, however, it teaches the reader to develop a practice that is observant, reflective, and grounded in the understanding of the basic principles of language and communication.

It's too important and you spend too much of your life at it. Let it become a means to endless possibilities, passion, and discovery. In Kingmaker, a highly successful former media executive shows you how.\n\nThrough Joanne Cini's experience and guidance, you'll make a plan … not just for success, but for bringing passion and personal fulfillment back into your working life, and keeping it there, no matter where your career takes you.\n\nYou'll learn positive, value-nourishing ways to move up the corporate ladder, specific techniques for overcoming dysfunctional organizations and \"negative energy,\" which battles are worth a fight, and when it's \"game over.\" Above all, you'll learn specific techniques for keeping your freedom, holding on to your values, and staying focused on your most important whole life goals-business and personal.\n\nMoving up without selling out.

It's about working within the rules-and gaining the freedom to change them. It's about a working life in which generosity trumps greed, stretch is a given, willingness is necessary, and idealism can be wrapped in reality for great results.\n\nKingmaker is devoted to the honor of a great working life.

Craddock identifies four power types and explains how to diagnose yours: The Pleaseryou make others feel good about themselves but need constant validation and approval from them The Charmeryou draw others in with your charm, yet trust is your Achilles heel The Commanderyou take charge of the situation and gain admiration from others, but fear any loss of control The Inspireryou are star power in action, yet your vision for the future can derail the needs of workers right nowThe book outlines a process for avoiding your type’s signature destructive reflexes and replacing them with new behaviorshelping you to interact productively with other people in the office. By showing you how to recognize your type’s blind spots and then recondition your actions, Power Genes will give you the insights and action plan you need to become a more consistently powerful professional. It’s time to throw out unproductive habits and take charge of your workplace relationships.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Development"]},{"id":"9781606498538","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Social Media Ethics Made Easy","authors":["Joseph W.

What about asking a random person on the street if you could borrow their phone? If the idea makes you squeamish, you're not alone--social psychologists have found that doing these very things makes most of us almost unbearably uncomfortable.\n\nBut here's the funny thing: even though we hate to ask for help, most people are wired to be helpful. And that's a good thing, because every day in the modern, uber-collaborative workplace, we all need to know when and how to call in the cavalry.\n\nHowever, asking people for help isn't intuitive; in fact, a lot of our instincts are wrong. As a result, we do a poor job of calling in the reinforcements we need, leaving confused or even offended colleagues in our wake.\n\nThis pragmatic book explains how to get it right. With humor, insight, and engaging storytelling, Heidi Grant, PhD, describes how to elicit helpful behavior from your friends, family, and colleagues--in a way that leaves them feeling genuinely happy to lend a hand.\n\nWhether you're a first-time manager or a seasoned leader, getting people to pitch in is what leadership is. Fortunately, people have a natural instinct to help other human beings; you just need to know how to channel this urge into what it is you specifically need them to do. It's not manipulation. It's just management.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Communication","Emotional Intelligence"]},{"id":"9781422189436","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Leading the Life You Want","authors":["Stewart Friedman"],"pages":"256","publication_date":"September 2014","description":"A Wall Street Journal Bestseller“For nearly thirty years, my life’s work has been to help people like you find ways to bring the often warring aspects of life into greater harmony.” — Stew Friedman, from Leading the Life You Want You’re busy trying to lead a “full” life. But does it really feel full—or are you stretched too thin? Enter Stew Friedman, Wharton professor, adviser to leaders across the globe, and passionate advocate of replacing the misguided metaphor of “work/life balance” with something more realistic and sustainable. If you’re seeking “balance” you’ll never achieve it, argues Friedman. The idea that “work” competes with “life” ignores the more nuanced reality of our humanity—the interaction of four domains: work, home, community, and the private self. The goal is to create harmony among them instead of thinking only in terms of trade-offs. It can be done. Building on his national bestseller, Total Leadership, and on decades of research, teaching, and practice as both consultant and senior executive, Friedman identifies the critical skills for integrating work and the rest of life. He illustrates them through compelling original stories of these remarkable people: • former Bain & Company CEO and Bridgespan co-founder Tom Tierney• Facebook COO and bestselling author Sheryl Sandberg• nonprofit leader and US Navy SEAL Eric Greitens• US First Lady Michelle Obama• soccer champion-turned-broadcaster Julie Foudy• renowned artist Bruce SpringsteenEach of these admirable (though surely imperfect) people exemplifies a set of skills—for being real, being whole, and being innovative—that produce a sense of purpose, coherence, and optimism.Based on interviews and research, their stories paint a vivid picture of how six very different leaders use these skills to act with authenticity, integrity, and creativity—and they prove that significant public success is accomplished not at the expense of the rest of life, but as the result of meaningful engagement in all its parts. With dozens of practical exercises for strengthening these skills, curated from the latest research in organizational psychology and related fields, this book will inspire you, inform you, and instruct you on how to take realistic steps now toward leading the life you truly want.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Development"]},{"id":"9780470344026","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Social Media Marketing: An Hour a Day","authors":["Dave Evans","Susan Bratton"],"pages":"432","publication_date":"October 2008","description":"If the idea of starting a social media marketing campaign overwhelms you, the author of Social Media Marketing: An Hour a Day will introduce you to the basics, demonstrate how to manage details and describe how you can track results.  Case studies, step-by-step guides, checklists, quizzes and hands-on tutorials will help you execute a social media marketing campaign in just one hour a day.  In addition, learn how to integrate social media metrics with traditional media measurements and how to leverage blogs, RSS feeds, podcasts, and user-generated content sharing sites like YouTube.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Marketing","Digital Marketing","Social Media Marketing"]},{"id":"9780749478629","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Conduct Risk Management","authors":["Dr. Roger Miles"],"pages":"312","publication_date":"January 2017","description":"Get the practical tools you need to understand the hidden drivers of behaviour, de-bias your customer offering and avoid fines and imprisonment under the conduct regime.","tags":["Security","Governance, Risk Management and Compliance (GRC)"]},{"id":"9780749467753","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Confidence at Work, 2nd Edition","authors":["Ros Taylor"],"pages":"216","publication_date":"July 2013","description":"Confidence at Work takes the theories and insights from major psychologists to help you to nurture true confidence from within and succeed in the competitive world of work.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Development","Confidence / Motivation"]},{"id":"9780749479725","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"The People Business","authors":["Annabel Dunstan","Imogen Osborne"],"pages":"216","publication_date":"July 2017","description":"Know what 'good' looks like in internal communications, enhance employee engagement, and improve the way your business functions with case studies from leading companies.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Communication"]},{"id":"53863MIT62231","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"When Employees Speak Up, Companies Win","authors":["Ethan Burris","Elizabeth McCune","Dawn Klinghoffer"],"pages":"6","publication_date":"November 2020","description":"New research shows that relatively few employees consistently share their thoughts and opinions on issues outside the scope of their jobs with their managers.
