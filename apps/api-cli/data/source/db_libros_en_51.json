Pirouz","Allison R. Johnson","Matthew Thomson"],"pages":"6","publication_date":"July 2015","description":"The Holy Grail of modern online marketing is video content that “goes viral,” meaning that it captures an enormous number of views and leads audiences to share, comment or click that they “like” a video. Various experts have ventured theories about what kind of content makes for a hit. The advice varies widely and is even contradictory. Depending on the expert, success is thought more likely if a video is humorous, shocking, dramatic, topical, warm, arousing, angry, scary, socially beneficial, cute, violent, sexy, uplifting, intriguing, quirky, interesting, authoritative, tear-jerking, educational, controversial or baby- and animal-filled. One of the reasons for the various views is that researchers have often looked at only popular videos and did not compare the popular clips with the content almost no one saw. To see if they could clarify some of the contradictions, the authors examined a mix of popular and unpopular videos, then systematically coded and empirically tested the effect of each element on some relatively objective and observational measures of viewer engagement. The authors assigned a team of research assistants to watch 750 videos and to independently score each on a range of attributes. Did the video feature babies, attempt to be funny or use sexually suggestive content? How would watching the video make the typical viewer feel? They collected information on dozens of different video elements and correlated these with three measures of engagement: the number of times people left comments on the video, the overall “liking” index for each video (calculated by subtracting the number of “dislikes” from “likes”) and the number of views. The authors’ key finding? Emotionally surprising videos generated liking and views more than any kind of specific content element they studied. The authors also looked at novel and incongruous content and found that both were associated with feelings of surprise, which increased views and liking. To get viewers’ attention by surprising them, marketers have two good choices: Show viewers something they have never seen before, or show them two things they are familiar with but in an original, juxtaposed way.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Marketing","Content Marketing"]},{"id":"9781394288946","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Sustainability Marketing, 3rd Edition","authors":["Frank-Martin Belz","Ken Peattie","Naz Onel"],"pages":"384","publication_date":"August 2025","description":"EQUIPS THE NEXT GENERATION OF MARKETERS WITH THE CRITICAL SKILLS AND ETHICAL MINDSET TO LEAD IN A TIME OF UNPRECEDENTED CHANGE\n\nSince its first publication in 2009, Sustainability Marketing has set the standard for how marketers can respond to global environmental and social challenges.

But as SAP ERP Financial Accounting and Controlling: Configuration and Use Management shows, it doesn't have to be so difficult. The book takes a systematic approach that leads SAP Financial Accounting and Controlling (FICO) users step by step through configuring and using all the program’s facets. This approach makes configuration complexities manageable. The book’s author—SAP expert, trainer, and accountant Andrew Okungbowa—ensures that both you and your end users are up and running quickly and confidently with FICO. He also provides sound and tested procedures that ensure your implementation works without error.\n\nSAP ERP Financial Accounting and Controlling: Configuration and Use Management is in fact the most comprehensive and easy-to-follow SAP FICO configuration book in the market. It incorporates a hands-on approach, with hundreds of screen shots and practical examples, that allows a person without prior configuration training to make SAP FICO ready for use in the enterprise. You’ll find that you don’t need to be a rocket scientist to grasp the concepts explained and apply them to your work—even when the finances are complicated, such as with the ins and outs of taxes, currency conversions, or special general ledger entries such as down payments or bills of exchange.\n\nProviding an in-depth coverage of both configuration and end user procedures, the book covers most aspects of the SAP FICO certification syllabus—SAP’s view of the module’s key tasks and procedures—including:\n\nConfiguring and using the general ledger and accounts payable and receivable screens\nConfiguring and completing closing procedures, asset accounting, and financial reporting\nConfiguring global settings and enterprise variables\nAccounting for both profit and cost centers\nCreating a house bank\nIntegrating FICO with other SAP modules\n\nTaking a jargon-free tone and providing an abundance of examples, Andrew Okungbowa provides a clear understanding of configuration techniques and the breadth of functionalities encompassed by SAP FICO.

Corporate executives know it's necessary, but there's only one problem. Nobody yet knows how to do it. Or they think it's all about bashing your vendors over the head until they reduce the price another 4%. Supplier Relationship Management: How to Maximize Vendor Value and Opportunity changes all that. Containing the best and most innovative advice from the operations and procurement experts at consultant AT Kearney, this book shows that SRM is at root a strategic discussion requiring cross-functional interaction and internal alignment at the highest levels. It requires an honest appraisal of the value that suppliers now bring to your firm, as well as their potential value. It then requires a frank and constructive business-to-business dialogue about how to improve the relationship. When this happens, a company reaps myriad benefits, ranging from new opportunity to added value to competitive advantage-and, quite likely, to overall (and sometimes substantial) cost reductions.\n\nThis book shows the most concrete methods you can use today to:\n\nIdentify value-adding opportunities in the supply chain\nWork closely with suppliers to maximize the benefits\nWork the \"Critical Cluster\" of suppliers, where the greatest opportunity for advantage lies\nReview suppliers to encourage constant gains in quality and cost\nTurn your SRM strategy into a major competitive advantage\n\nSupplier Relationship Management introduces and explains the Supplier Interaction Model, a key tool that will help you get the most from your supplier relationships. It segments the supplier universe into nine categories, from those you want to run away from fast to those so good and so useful to your organization that it can make sense to invest in them directly. Numerous case studies show how to apply the principles to your situation.\n\nSupplier Relationship Management burns off the fog that has surrounded the procurement process for far too long. It is the definitive guide for business executives who want to get the maximum benefits from suppliers and gain very real advantages over competitors.\n\n\"","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Sales","Customer Relationship Management (CRM)"]},{"id":"9781119365570","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Marketing For Dummies, 5th Edition","authors":["Jeanette McMurtry"],"pages":"408","publication_date":"June 2017","description":"The classic, bestselling marketing guide, updated for the digital era\n\nMarketing For Dummies, 5th Edition is the ultimate handbook for boosting your business.

With the power of SAP HANA and the enhancements introduced in ABAP 7.5, developers are now equipped to rethink how applications are built, executed, and optimized. This book is your guide to that transformation.\n\nWe begin by understanding the core shift: moving data-intensive operations directly into the HANA database. When implemented correctly, this \"code pushdown\" philosophy dramatically reduces data transfer and processing overhead. AMDP (ABAP Managed Database Procedures), our in-database processing engine, enables us to write complex logic directly in SQLScript, harnessing HANA’s parallel processing capabilities. We focus on crafting efficient AMDP procedures by adopting set-based operations and minimizing unnecessary data movement.\n\nNext, we explore Core Data Services (CDS) Views, our go-to data modeling tool. CDS Views are not just simple database views; they act as semantic layers that define how our applications interact with data. We learn to create optimized CDS Views by leveraging associations, annotations, and table functions, enabling us to build reusable, high-performance data models. These views simplify complex queries, improve data consistency, and enhance application flexibility.\n\nWe then turn to Native SQL, our direct line to the HANA database. While AMDP and CDS Views provide powerful abstractions, Native SQL offers ultimate control for specialized tasks. We embed Native SQL within AMDP procedures to access database-specific features and fine-tune performance for critical operations. Along the way, we apply best practices for writing efficient queries, with a strong focus on indexing, join strategies, and precise data filtering.\n\nThroughout this journey, we emphasize the importance of rigorous testing and proactive monitoring. Just like a race car undergoes extensive testing before hitting the track, our ABAP applications require careful validation to ensure accuracy and optimal performance. We explore techniques for unit testing AMDP procedures, validating CDS Views, and monitoring query performance. We also look at strategies for detecting and addressing potential bottlenecks before they affect end users.\n\nSAP ABAP 7.5 Optimization for HANA is not just about writing faster code—it’s about fundamentally rethinking how we develop applications. By embracing code pushdown, leveraging AMDP, CDS Views, and Native SQL, and implementing robust testing and monitoring strategies, we build ABAP applications that are not only faster, but also more scalable, maintainable, and adaptable to the ever-evolving demands of modern business.\n\nYou Will:\n\nLearn how to implement the \"code pushdown\" philosophy, moving data-intensive operations directly into the HANA database to reduce data transfer and processing overhead\nUnderstand to create optimized CDS Views, leveraging associations, annotations, and table functions to build reusable, high-performance data models that simplify complex queries and improve data consistency.\nExplore how to write complex logic directly in SQLScript using AMDP, harnessing HANA's parallel processing capabilities, and using Native SQL for specialized tasks, accessing database-specific features to optimize performance.\n\nThis Book is For:\n\nABAP Developers, SAP Consultants and Architects and IT Managers and Technical Leads","tags":["Data","Data Engineering","Relational Databases","SAP HANA"]},{"id":"9781398606456","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Martech Handbook","authors":["Darrell Alfonso"],"pages":"256","publication_date":"August 2022","description":"Create and manage a powerful marketing technology stack that will add value and connect all key areas of marketing, with this jargon-free and easy-to-follow guide.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Marketing"]},{"id":"9781119122098","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Salesforce Marketing Cloud For Dummies","authors":["Chester Bullock","Mark Pollard"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"October 2017","description":"Salesforce Marketing Cloud: Take your digital marketing on a journey!\n\nEverything seems to be moving to the cloud these days—and digital marketing is no exception!

When implemented correctly, this \"code pushdown\" philosophy dramatically reduces data transfer and processing overhead. AMDP (ABAP Managed Database Procedures), our in-database processing engine, enables us to write complex logic directly in SQLScript, harnessing HANA’s parallel processing capabilities. We focus on crafting efficient AMDP procedures by adopting set-based operations and minimizing unnecessary data movement.\n\nNext, we explore Core Data Services (CDS) Views, our go-to data modeling tool. CDS Views are not just simple database views; they act as semantic layers that define how our applications interact with data. We learn to create optimized CDS Views by leveraging associations, annotations, and table functions, enabling us to build reusable, high-performance data models. These views simplify complex queries, improve data consistency, and enhance application flexibility.\n\nWe then turn to Native SQL, our direct line to the HANA database. While AMDP and CDS Views provide powerful abstractions, Native SQL offers ultimate control for specialized tasks. We embed Native SQL within AMDP procedures to access database-specific features and fine-tune performance for critical operations. Along the way, we apply best practices for writing efficient queries, with a strong focus on indexing, join strategies, and precise data filtering.\n\nThroughout this journey, we emphasize the importance of rigorous testing and proactive monitoring. Just like a race car undergoes extensive testing before hitting the track, our ABAP applications require careful validation to ensure accuracy and optimal performance. We explore techniques for unit testing AMDP procedures, validating CDS Views, and monitoring query performance. We also look at strategies for detecting and addressing potential bottlenecks before they affect end users.\n\nSAP ABAP 7.5 Optimization for HANA is not just about writing faster code—it’s about fundamentally rethinking how we develop applications. By embracing code pushdown, leveraging AMDP, CDS Views, and Native SQL, and implementing robust testing and monitoring strategies, we build ABAP applications that are not only faster, but also more scalable, maintainable, and adaptable to the ever-evolving demands of modern business.\n\nYou Will:\n\nLearn how to implement the \"code pushdown\" philosophy, moving data-intensive operations directly into the HANA database to reduce data transfer and processing overhead\nUnderstand to create optimized CDS Views, leveraging associations, annotations, and table functions to build reusable, high-performance data models that simplify complex queries and improve data consistency.\nExplore how to write complex logic directly in SQLScript using AMDP, harnessing HANA's parallel processing capabilities, and using Native SQL for specialized tasks, accessing database-specific features to optimize performance.\n\nThis Book is For:\n\nABAP Developers, SAP Consultants and Architects and IT Managers and Technical Leads","tags":["Data","Data Engineering","Relational Databases","SAP HANA"]},{"id":"9781119122098","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Salesforce Marketing Cloud For Dummies","authors":["Chester Bullock","Mark Pollard"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"October 2017","description":"Salesforce Marketing Cloud: Take your digital marketing on a journey!\n\nEverything seems to be moving to the cloud these days—and digital marketing is no exception!

Storage Area Networks (SANs) and Network Attached Storage (NAS) allow organizations to manage and back up huge file systems quickly, thereby keeping their lifeblood flowing. W. Curtis Preston's insightful book takes you through the ins and outs of building and managing large data centers using SANs and NAS.\n\nAs a network administrator you're aware that multi-terabyte data stores are common and petabyte data stores are starting to appear. Given this much data, how do you ensure that it is available all the time, that access times and throughput are reasonable, and that the data can be backed up and restored in a timely manner? SANs and NAS provide solutions that help you work through these problems, with special attention to the difficulty of backing up huge data stores.\n\nThis book explains the similarities and differences of SANs and NAS to help you determine which, or both, of these complementing technologies are appropriate for your network. Using SANs, for instance, is a way to share multiple devices (tape drives and disk drives) for storage, while NAS is a means for centrally storing files so they can be shared. Preston exams each technology with a vendor neutral approach, starting with the building blocks of a SAN and how they can be assembled for effective storage solutions. He covers day-to-day management and backup and recovery for both SANs and NAS in detail.\n\nWhether you're a seasoned storage administrator or a network administrator charged with taking on this role, you'll find all the information you need to make informed architecture and data management decisions. The book fans out to explore technologies such as RAID and other forms of monitoring that will help complement your data center. With an eye on the future, other technologies that might affect the architecture and management of the data center are explored.

Everyone wants to build the next $100 million business and author Mark Roberge has actually done it using a unique methodology that he shares with his readers. As an MIT alum with an engineering background, Roberge challenged the conventional methods of scaling sales utilizing the metrics-driven, process-oriented lens through which he was trained to see the world. In this book, he reveals his formulas for success. Readers will learn how to apply data, technology, and inbound selling to every aspect of accelerating sales, including hiring, training, managing, and generating demand.\n\nAs SVP of Worldwide Sales and Services for software company HubSpot, Mark led hundreds of his employees to the acquisition and retention of the company's first 10,000 customers across more than 60 countries.

Often, the biggest challenge they face is the task of scaling sales. They crave a blueprint for success, but fail to find it because sales has traditionally been referred to as an art form, rather than a science. You can't major in sales in college. Many people question whether sales can even be taught. Executives and entrepreneurs are often left feeling helpless and hopeless.\n\nThe Sales Acceleration Formula completely alters this paradigm. In today's digital world, in which every action is logged and masses of data sit at our fingertips, building a sales team no longer needs to be an art form. There is a process. Sales can be predictable.\n\nA formula does exist.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Sales"]},{"id":"9780470922231","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Rainmaking Conversations: Influence, Persuade, and Sell in any Situation","authors":["Mike Schultz","John E.

In addition to sharing information on brand activities through official social media pages or accounts, employees share brand-related information, make comments endorsing the organization's brand, and display behaviors that are consistent (or at odds) with the brand values and promise. For companies, the social media behavior of employees represents both an opportunity and a risk.\n\nSome companies encourage employees to become brand ambassadors to consumers and job candidates on social networks such as LinkedIn and share the company culture on Facebook and Twitter. However, the authors found that in the companies they studied, employees on the whole displayed very low brand engagement on social media. Management was surprised to learn that their employees were not following the company on Facebook or other popular social media sites. When employees are not fans or supporters of the company's products, the authors noted, this can send an ambiguous message to employees' contacts and deprive the company of potential supporters.\n\nSo what can companies do? From their research, the authors developed a set of recommendations for encouraging effective employee branding on social media. The first recommendation is to empower a stable of employee advocates. The authors say employees born in the era of the internet (so-called \"digital native\") tend to be more active on social media and are more likely to become brand ambassadors for the company. The second recommendation is to outline the boundaries of employees' social media presence: When employees feel partly responsible for the company's success, they are willing to invest in activities to enhance the customer experience and are willing to exhibit brand-building behaviors through their digital networks and on social media sites. The authors also suggest fostering employee engagement with the brand to help employees understand the brand promise and have an emotional attachment to it. Another recommendation is to make content relevant and easy to share. Finally, companies should reward employee voice. The most effective rewards include listening to employee feedback, paying attention to employee suggestions, and congratulating employees on their achievements.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Marketing","Digital Marketing","Social Media Marketing"]},{"id":"53863MIT65201","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Design Your Marketing Organization to Fit Your Company’s Growth Stage","authors":["Kimberly A.

Think of Nike and its community of runners, Nike+, and you’ll quickly understand that creating and fostering an online community around a product or brand is a powerful way to boost marketing efforts, gain valuable insight into consumers, increase revenue, improve consumer loyalty, and enhance customer service efforts.\n\nCompanies now have the unprecedented opportunity to integrate their brand’s messaging into the everyday lives of their target audiences. But while supporting the growth of online communities should be at the top of every company’s priority list, all too often it falls by the wayside. That’s why brand strategy expert and digital marketer Lauren Perkins wrote The Community Manager’s Playbook (#CMplaybook on Twitter), a must-read guide for business and brand builders who need to strengthen their approach to online B2C community management and customer engagement.\n\nAs Perkins explains, if companies want to create thriving online communities focused on their product or brand, they must do more than simply issue a few tweets a day, create (and then abandon) a Facebook page, and blog every once in a while. Instead, organizations of all sizes must treat community management as a central component of their overall marketing strategy. When they do, they will be rewarded handsomely with greater brand awareness, increased customer use and retention, lower acquisition costs, and a tribe of consumers who can’t wait to purchase their next product.\n\nPerkins not only teaches readers how to build an engaging community strategy from the ground up, but she also provides them with the tactical community management activities they need to acquire and retain customers, create compelling content, and track their results along the way. Distinctive in its comprehensive, step-by-step approach to creating online communities that are fully consistent with a company’s existing brand voice, The Community Manager’s Playbook:\n\nExplains how excellent community management provides a competitive advantage with a large impact on sales\nProvides an in-depth overview of brand and business alignment\nTeaches readers how to identify their community's online target audience and influence their needs and wants\nDetails the appropriate online channels through which content should be distributed\nChampions the use of an agile approach through repeated testing to maximize the return on every company investment\nDiscusses the many diverse metrics that can be used to measure community scope\n\nToday, there is no brand strategy without a community strategy. Companies that are not developing communities are losing control of their brands and missing opportunities to optimize their marketing investments. With The Community Manager’s Playbook as their guide, however, marketing professionals and the companies and brands they represent will be equipped with the tools they need to manage their online marketing efforts, engage their core customers at every level, leverage community insights into the product development cycle, and ensure that their messaging is heard across all corners of the digital landscape.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Marketing","Digital Marketing"]},{"id":"9780470891070","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Event Marketing: How to Successfully Promote Events, Festivals, Conventions, and Expositions, Second Edition","authors":["C.

This demand is propelling the move of storage into the network. Also, the increasing complexity of managing large numbers of storage devices and vast amounts of data is driving greater business value into software and services.\n\nWith current estimates of the amount of data to be managed and made available increasing at 60% each year, this outlook is where a storage area network (SAN) enters the arena.

In fact, the contribution of services to the economies of the USA first to be declared a service economy with the services sector contributing more than 50 percent of the GDP and other developed countries continues to grow even now. However, in recent times, even developing economies have come to rely on the services sector for economic growth.\n\nOrganizations have come to realize that services characterized by intangibility, perishability and variability-are different from goods hence, their marketing requires the use of specifically formulated strategies.

The second edition of Services Marketing, with an enhanced conceptual foundation, meets this requirement of students, managers, and marketing professionals.

The text introduces and parallels the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) software product quality model, demonstrating 15 performance requirements that represent dimensions of software quality, including: reliability, recoverability, robustness, execution efficiency (i.e., speed), efficiency, scalability, portability, security, automation, maintainability, modularity, readability, testability, stability, and reusability. The text is intended to be read cover-to-cover or used as a reference tool to instruct, inspire, deliver, and evaluate software quality.\n\nA common fault in many software development environments is a focus on functional requirements—the what and how—to the detriment of performance requirements, which specify instead how well software should function (assessed through software execution) or how easily software should be maintained (assessed through code inspection). Without the definition and communication of performance requirements, developers risk either building software that lacks intended quality or wasting time delivering software that exceeds performance objectives—thus, either underperforming or gold-plating, both of which are undesirable. Managers, customers, and other decision makers should also understand the dimensions of software quality both to define performance requirements at project outset as well as to evaluate whether those objectives were met at software completion.\n\nAs data analytic software, SAS transforms data into information and ultimately knowledge and data-driven decisions. Not surprisingly, data quality is a central focus and theme of SAS literature; however, code quality is far less commonly described and too often references only the speed or efficiency with which software should execute, omitting other critical dimensions of software quality. SAS® software project definitions and technical requirements often fall victim to this paradox, in which rigorous quality requirements exist for data and data products yet not for the software that undergirds them.\n\nBy demonstrating the cost and benefits of software quality inclusion and the risk of software quality exclusion, stakeholders learn to value, prioritize, implement, and evaluate dimensions of software quality within risk management and project management frameworks of the software development life cycle (SDLC). Thus, SAS Data Analytic Development recalibrates business value, placing code quality on par with data quality, and performance requirements on par with functional requirements.","tags":["Data","Data Science","Analytics Platforms","SAS"]},{"id":"9781119217138","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Marketing Plans, 8th Edition","authors":["Malcolm McDonald","Hugh Wilson"],"pages":"640","publication_date":"November 2016","description":"A fully revised and updated 8th edition of the highly renowned international bestseller\n\nThe 8th edition of this highly acclaimed bestseller is thoroughly revised with every chapter having been updated with special attention to the latest developments in marketing.\n\nMarketing Plans is designed as a tool and a user–friendly learning resource.

Doerr","Neil Rackham"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"May 2014","description":"What do winners of major sales do differently than the sellers who almost won, but ultimately came in second place?\n\nMike Schultz and John Doerr, bestselling authors and world-renowned sales experts, set out to find the answer. They studied more than 700 business-to-business purchases made by buyers who represented a total of $3.1 billion in annual purchasing power. When they compared the winners to the second-place finishers, they found surprising results.\n\nNot only do sales winners sell differently, they sell radically differently, than the second-place finishers.\n\nIn recent years, buyers have increasingly seen products and services as replaceable. You might think this would mean that the sale goes to the lowest bidder. Not true! A new breed of seller—the insight seller—is winning the sale with strong prices and margins even in the face of increasing competition and commoditization.\n\nIn Insight Selling, Schultz and Doerr share the surprising results of their research on what sales winners do differently, and outline exactly what you need to do to transform yourself and your team into insight sellers. They introduce a simple three-level model based on what buyers say tip the scales in favor of the winners:\n\nLevel 1 \"Connect.\" Winners connect the dots between customer needs and company solutions, while also connecting with buyers as people.\n\nLevel 2 \"Convince.\" Winners convince buyers that they can achieve maximum return, that the risks are acceptable, and that the seller is the best choice among all options.\n\nLevel 3 \"Collaborate.\" Winners collaborate with buyers by bringing new ideas to the table, delivering new ideas and insights, and working with buyers as a team.\n\nThey also found that much of the popular and current advice given to sellers can damage sales results. Insight Selling is both a strategic and tactical guide that will separate the good advice from the bad, and teach you how to put the three levels of selling to work to inspire buyers, influence their agendas, and maximize value. If you want to find yourself and your team in the winner's circle more often, this book is a must-read.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Sales"]},{"id":"9781635260427","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"An Introduction to SAS Visual Analytics","authors":["Tricia Aanderud","Rob Collum","Ryan Kumpfmiller"],"pages":"294","publication_date":"March 2017","description":"When it comes to business intelligence and analytical capabilities, SAS Visual Analytics is the premier solution for data discovery, visualization, and reporting.

This is an important, current and detailed book to which every organization should pay close attention to improve customer relationships and create shareholder value.\"\n\n— Marcus Ruebsam, Vice-President, Line-of-Business Marketing Solutions, SAP AG, Walldorf, Germany\n\n\"There are many books on CRM, but I recommend this one because Gordon's book does what others do not. He considers CRM strategy and evolves it to recognize a new customer, one who is always connected, socially available and influential. The book doesn't just discuss many point solutions for specific marketing challenges; it integrates technology with strategy, people, process and customer analytics to develop relationships continuously. This book is a broad and deep exploration of CRM, providing practical, fact-based perspectives that every company can use to validate and rethink their customer and stakeholder relationships.\"\n\n— Helmuth Cepeda, Small, Medium and Distribution Director, Microsoft Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico\n\nMarketing has changed fundamentally in the last few years and has become an entirely new discipline, one that focuses on a new customer and a new relationship, framed by new principles, strategies, processes, roles and tactics. Individual customers are economically targeted and served, and treated as segments of one rather than members of a target market. Word of mouth and recommendations are vital as customers influence one another more than a company can do within its own advertising or customer dialogs. Today's customer is always online, accessible and connected. Now marketing is not only direct and customer-specific but a continuous process by which companies seek to engage customers and be progressively more relevant, attractive and valuable. This is the era of a new customer relationship—an individual relationship that is social, mobile and local, influenced by peers and shaped by cognitive, behavioural and social psychological principles. New techniques, processes and technologies transform what it means to implement marketing strategy and achieve improved business results.\n\nThe new customer relationship requires that even those companies that have embraced customer relationship management ought to reassess their customer management. Now every marketing decision, whether online or in the physical world, whether of a technological nature, whether it affects customer experience, communications, dialogs, teaching or organizational memory, every decision should be seen through a single lens focused on the individual customers who matter most. Managing the New Customer Relationship provides a strategic and practical guide to help companies attract, develop, sustain and build more valuable relationships by:\n\nExpanding upon existing customer relationship management theories, concepts and methods to make these considerations more useful, strategic and contemporary\n\nRecognizing the profound importance of social media and how to plan customer engagement in the social context of each customer\n\nExploring new technologies that offer new opportunities for engaging customers, including mobile, local, the cloud and customer analytics\n\nDemonstrating how to develop customer-specific understanding, predict what customers will want next, and how to manage each individual customer, and\n\nOffering perspectives to help the organization endure by focusing a chain of relationships on the end customer and creating meaning for stakeholders that can make relationships more intense and robust.\n\nManaging the New Customer Relationship is for organizations of all sizes in all industries, for private- and public-sector organizations and not-for-profits. In short, every organization can apply the new principles, strategies, techniques and technologies discussed here to recognize important marketplace changes, plan to improve relationship and financial results and capture new shareholder value from new customer relationships.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Sales","Customer Relationship Management (CRM)"]},{"id":"9781633693289","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"HBR's 10 Must Reads on Sales (with bonus interview of Andris Zoltners) (HBR's 10 Must Reads)","authors":["Harvard Business Review","Philip Kotler","Andris Zoltners"],"pages":"192","publication_date":"May 2017","description":"Sales isn't about pushing products or being efficient; it's about building the right systems to manage and empower your salespeople.\n\nIf you read nothing else on sales, read these 10 articles.

The answers are fascinating and, for retailers, they're cash in the bank. In Inside the Mind of the Shopper: The Science of Retailing, world-renowned retail consultant Dr. Herb Sorensen, Ph.D. uncovers the truth about the retail shopper and rips away the myths and mistakes that lead retailers to miss their greatest opportunities. Every year, says Sorensen, shoppers will spend a quadrillion seconds in supermarkets and they'll waste 80% of that time. Sorensen analyzes consumer behavior–how shoppers make buying decisions as they move through supermarkets and other retail stores–and presents powerful, tested strategies for designing more effective stores, improving merchandising, and driving double-digit sales increases.

Designing Service Excellence: People and Technology provides practical information on the design, management, and organization of many different types of service industries, such as hotels, restaurants, banks and financial institutions, retail, and the public sector. The authors investigate the consumers’ experience and judgment on service quality, which ultimately determines the success or failure of the service. They then consider people, usability, and technology in the automation of high-quality service.\n\nThis research-driven book identifies service—in a variety of forms—as an area of business and management where rapid change is taking place. The authors examine how service has become a balance between people and technology and explore this relationship as one of the key drivers of change. They discuss how social, cultural, and technological developments influence the ways in which customers contact, negotiate, and purchase services from their chosen service providers. These same developments are also driving communications between customers relating to the services they buy and are willing to recommend to others (or otherwise). Intermingled, these features of our current-day lives have changed the nature of service provision and service use. When your organization has its moment of truth, how will it measure up? Organizations whose business has service at its core and whose activities focus mainly on service design, management, and delivery are likely to find increasingly that, for survival, service is a matter of life or death. This book provides a deep understanding of the relationship between people and technology along with an ergonomic approach to the design and management of service delivery that helps you deliver the value and benefits that customers not only want, but increasingly come to expect.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Sales","Customer Service"]},{"id":"9781948976978","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Getting to Market With Your MVP","authors":["Dr. J.C.

Written for both designers and developers, this book demonstrates the power of both Sass and Compass through a series of examples that address common pain points associated with traditional stylesheet authoring. The book begins with simple topics such as CSS resets and moves on to more involved topics such as grid frameworks and CSS3 vendor implementation differences.\n\nAbout the Technology\n\nSass is an extension of CSS3, adding language features for creating well-formatted, standard CSS using the command line tool or a web-framework plugin. Compass is a framework that sits atop Sass and tackles common stylesheet problems such as grid layouts, handling CSS3 vendor differences, and production environment stylesheet optimization. Together, they do for CSS what jQuery has done for JavaScript: solve real world problems, letting designers and developers create stylesheets more efficiently.\n\nAbout the Book\n\nFor 15 years, we've been using CSS to patiently paint the web by hand. No more! Sass and Compass add scripting and a library of components to standard CSS so you can simplify stylesheet authoring, automate tedious tasks, and add dynamic styling features to your pages. Think of Sass and Compass as power tools that allow you to paint with remarkable speed and precision.\n\nSass and Compass in Action is a hands-on guide to stylesheet authoring using these two revolutionary tools.

Correction: make that a very, very few organizations. For the rest, they are metaphorically parading in their digital underwear. All is not lost however.

Why?The authors point out that, as ventures grow, their complexity increases. Not only are there more “moving parts,” but interdependencies are more difficult to manage. The original business model must deal with new products or markets. Early leadership behaviors that worked in establishing the business are often not adequate to manage and grow it. SG&A (selling, general and administrative) costs often accelerate faster than revenues. The result: Each year thousands of promising ventures are either forced to go out of business or operate in small niches because they are unable to scale their sales activities. The authors illustrate with the example of a real company in the payroll services business. After a period of rapid growth, “BusinessProcessingCo.” saw its revenue growth stall and the SG&A burden become untenable. The company had a costly ad hoc process for evaluating opportunities, forecasting and business development initiatives. The leadership team was unable to define its core customers. As the authors explain, different customers come with different transaction costs for the seller. This affects “upstream” capacity utilization in two respects: the product mix of the selling company (what kind of capacity is utilized) and how capacity is utilized (for example, production lines in manufacturing and the types of people and skills in a service business). The selection of customers also affects “downstream” after-sale economics and organizational requirements. The article discusses the importance of customer selection and how intelligent opportunity management can help companies scale their selling initiatives. It concludes with a general framework for helping executives analyze sales productivity and pipeline value.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Sales"]},{"id":"9781635260380","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Predictive Modeling with SAS Enterprise Miner, 3rd Edition","authors":["Kattamuri S.

Consumers are tired of interruption, push, mass media and the manipulation of marketing and advertising generally. They want to deal with honest, ethical companies that have heart and purpose and that care about serving all their stakeholders instead of their pockets. Conscious Marketing proves that marketing can really work if the paradigm is shifted—radically. In Conscious Marketing: How to Create an Awesome Business With a New Approach to Marketing, author Carolyn Tate demonstrates just how beneficial this shift can be. By practising the four tenets of conscious marketing, companies can raise their brand's profile and attract customers for life. The book shows how building a business with a higher-purpose can lead to sustainability, profitability and industry leadership. Conscious marketing works for both multinational corporations and cash-strapped small business alike.\n\nIn the modern market, a business that does well and contributes to the elevation of humanity and the planet attracts the best customers, employees, suppliers and investors. These people evangelize, and the brand reach expands exponentially further and to a more loyal audience than traditional marketing will ever capture. This concept and other topics in the book include:\n\nWhat's wrong with marketing and why it doesn't work\n\nWhat \"conscious\" means to the consumer, business, leader and marketer\n\nThe who, what, why and how of conscious marketing\n\nNavigating the shift from traditional to conscious practices\n\nThe book includes a three-part guide to crafting an actionable plan, including where to find help. Marketing doesn't have to be the budgetary dead weight it has become. It can be fun, human and inspiring for everyone involved, but change requires a deep shift in thinking and behaviour that goes way beyond the transaction or the sale.

Then service gets to make a brief appearance – for as long as it takes to calm the customer down and fix whatever foul-up jeopardized the relationship.In Uncommon Service, Frances Frei and Anne Morriss show how, in a volatile economy where the old rules of strategic advantage no longer hold true, service must become a competitive weapon, not a damage-control function. That means weaving service tightly into every core decision your company makes. The authors reveal a transformed view of service, presenting an operating model built on tough choices organizations must make:• How do customers define “excellence” in your offering? Is it convenience? Friendliness? Flexible choices? Price?• How will you get paid for that excellence? Will you charge customers more? Get them to handle more service tasks themselves? • How will you empower your employees to deliver excellence? What will your recruiting, selection, training, and job design practices look like? What about your organizational culture? • How will you get your customers to behave? For example, what do you need to do to get them to treat your employees with respect?

As the emphasis has moved from the physical product (or service) to customer experience, how consumers relate to products in their own authored \"play\" has increasingly become the focus of marketing thought and practice. Using a variety of well--known (e.g. Victoria's Secret, Intel) and less obvious (e.g., the Guggenheim) examples, the book explores the implications of a focus on the show/experience in an entertaining way. Importantly, however, the book also provides a seven--step procedure for moving from identification of a desired image to the quantitative measurement of performance. This raises the book above the level of identifying a phenomenon to the position of suggesting something useful to do about it. The real value of a book is whether it causes the reader to think as well as stay awake. This one succeeds on both counts.\"\n\n--Don Lehmann, George E.

Adjei","Jill J. Avery"],"pages":"8","publication_date":"January 2014","description":"Most managers know that listening to customers makes good business sense. Businesses have much to gain from actively seeking and encouraging customer participation, which the authors define as getting customers to provide constructive suggestions and share their ideas on how to shape product and service offerings. Yet many companies only pay lip service to this idea. Rather than encouraging customers to share their views about the company and its products with managers, the authors found, companies tend to focus on encouraging customers to take part in spreading positive word of mouth. Yet word of mouth is only one type of voluntary behavior that customers engage in. Moreover, it indicates only what people on the outside are saying, not how companies can improve their offerings or what customers may be looking for. The authors, who conducted surveys of customers as well as interviews and roundtable discussions with senior executives in a variety of industries, found that both customer word of mouth and customer- to-business interactions are associated with a customer’s propensity to buy more of a company’s products and services. While not all satisfied customers become repeat buyers, encouraging them to provide feedback and suggestions helps tie them more closely to the business. Companies can even recapture defecting customers simply by contacting them and encouraging them to participate. In addition, customer-to-business interaction is often more malleable than customer-to-customer word of mouth and more readily within the control of management. In a study of customers of a global bank, the authors found that customers who purchased the most were individuals who participated and engaged in much word-of-mouth behavior. High participation/ high word-of-mouth customers were the most loyal and attached to the brand; customers who did not participate tended to be the least valuable, the least loyal and the least attached to the organization regardless of whether they spread positive word of mouth. The implications of the findings are that fostering customer participation can be very valuable and that companies are better off emphasizing customer participation over word of mouth (as opposed to the reverse), because it creates more customer “stickiness” (as in greater attachment and commitment). Nevertheless, the authors say, the two approaches should be seen as two sides of a coin, working both internally and externally to build financial value for companies.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Sales","Customer Service"]},{"id":"53863MIT58427","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"The Question Every Executive Should Ask","authors":["Paul Michelman"],"pages":"6","publication_date":"July 2017","description":"Every CEO has stakeholder groups whose interests he or she needs to balance: customers, employees, the board, shareholders, regulators, partners, nongovernmental organizations, and local communities. Bernard J. Tyson, chairman and CEO of managed care giant Kaiser Permanente Health Care, arguably has more than most. In addition to the nearly 12 million people who receive their health care from Kaiser Permanente, Tyson’s stakeholders include thousands of physicians, nurses, medical technicians, administrators, and managers — as well as unions, government agencies, industry watchdogs, pharmaceutical suppliers, and more. Given all the competing priorities and pressures (including political and economic uncertainties associated with the U.S. health care market), how does a CEO stay grounded? Tyson recently spoke about his views on leadership with MIT Sloan Management Review editor in chief Paul Michelman. On Hiring “Wherever in the organization we are hiring, we need to ask if the employee’s personal mission in life aligns with the mission of the organization. My job is to maintain an environment conducive to attracting people who fit our culture. Making sure we are all clear on the mission is core to that.” On Dealing With Complexity “I would argue that, in simplistic terms, the old model was [that] those in management were the thinkers, and the rest of the workers were the doers. Now we live in a day and age where everybody gets to think and do. I want the frontline nurse, who has access to the same information I do, to act on the information pertaining to his or her profession and, with that access and freedom, come up with new ideas and new ways of getting work done.” On Empowerment “In the past, power was centralized in the hands of the few people who had access to information and who used that access to direct the narrative for the company. So we were benefiting from the intellect of just a handful of people. Now that information is available everywhere, the leader’s critical question is, ‘How do I charge up the organization so that we’re maximizing the intellect of all of our people?’… As I’m talking to you right now, a medical team is likely attending to someone with a near-death experience in one of our emergency departments. My job is not to call to see what they’re going to do next. It’s to make sure they have the tools, the equipment, the know-how, and the decision power to make the right judgment when called upon, in the interest of the person whom they are serving.” On People Speaking Their Minds “In senior management meetings, when one of my executives feels strongly about an issue and they want to take me on, sometimes they’ll ask, ‘Freedom of speech?’ And I’ll say, ‘Yes.’ And they’ll repeat, ‘Freedom of speech?’ And I’ll say, ‘Absolutely.’ And then they’ll come out with it: ‘I think you’re dead wrong.’ They don’t have to sugarcoat it. They just simply put the code out there: ‘Freedom of speech?’ Now our management needs to continue to get comfortable that freedom of speech exists everywhere in the organization.

Media, digital content, educational kits, museum exhibitions and so on are the actions of an unadvertization, which has the potential to transform not only the rapport brands have with the public but also representations of knowledge and culture.\n\nThe communicative approach at the heart of this book illuminates the contemporary transformations of communication, highlighting three main types of cultural mediations: media, education, and cultural heritage institutions. Cultural Mediations of Brands thus provides a theoretical and critical analysis of the brand and the symbolic effectiveness attributed to it.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Marketing"]},{"id":"9780470318126","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Salesforce.com® For Dummies®","authors":["Tom Wong","Liz Kao"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"August 2008","description":"Ready to start solving business challenges with CRM (Customer Relationship Management) software?

We were experiencing the increase of conflict communication in hybrid spaces prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, yet the global lockdown that shifted everyone to remote teaching, learning, and working heightened our attention to the impact of technology and social media on conflict dynamics. While social media is often implicated in the spread of alternative facts, false news, and intimidation, technology and new media also have the capacity to enhance and transform conflict communication in education, workplace, and socio-political settings. The contributors to this volume showcase cutting-edge research that helps us make sense of the times we are living in and is organized in three sections: (1) Using technology to promote dialogue and collaboration, (2) Conflict communication on social media, (3) Online conflict management in education, training, and practice. This collection is relevant to scholars of conflict studies as it highlights key trends and areas for future research to improve conflict communication, dialogue, and collaboration and proposes ideas for using technology and social media to transform and connect rather than polarize and divide.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Marketing","Digital Marketing","Social Media Marketing"]},{"id":"0738496987","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"SAN Multiprotocol Routing: An Introduction and Implementation","authors":["Jon Tate","Steve Fodor","Jure Arzensek"],"pages":"584","publication_date":"November 2006","description":"This IBM Redbooks publication supersedes both:\n\nIBM TotalStorage: Introduction to SAN Routing, SG24-7119-00 Implementing the IBM TotalStorage Multiprotocol Routers, SG24-7246-00\n\nThe rapid spread and adoption of production storage area networks (SANs) has fuelled the need for multiprotocol routers. The routers provide improved scalability, security, and manageability by enabling devices in separate SAN fabrics to communicate without merging fabrics into a single, large SAN fabric. This capability enables clients to initially deploy separate SAN solutions at the departmental and data center levels. Then, clients can consolidate these separate solutions into large enterprise SAN solutions as their experience and requirements grow and change.\n\nAlternatively, multiprotocol routers can help to connect existing enterprise SANs for a variety of reasons. For instance, the introduction of Small Computer System Interface over IP (iSCSI) provides for the connection of low-end, low-cost hosts to enterprise SANs. The use of an Internet Protocol (IP) in the Fibre Channel (FC) environment provides for resource consolidation and disaster recovery planning over long distances. And the use of FC-FC routing services provides connectivity between two or more fabrics without having to merge them into a single SAN.\n\nThis book targets storage network administrators, system designers, architects, and IT professionals who sell, design, or administer SANs. It introduces you to the products, concepts, and technology in the IBM System Storage SAN Routing portfolio.

Follow old, outdated rules.\n\nIn Content Inc., one of today’s most sought-after content-marketing strategists reveals a new model for entrepreneurial success. Simply put, it’s about developing valuable content, building an audience around that content, and then creating a product for that audience.\n\nNotice a shift?\n\nAuthor Joe Pulizzi flips the traditional entrepreneurial approach of first creating a product and then trying to find customers. It’s a brilliant reverse-engineering of a model that rarely succeeds.\n\nThe radical six-step business-building process revealed in this book is smart, simple, practical, and cost-effective. And best of all, it works. It’s a strategy Pulizzi used to build his own successful company, Content Marketing Institute, which has landed on Inc. magazine’s list of fastest growing private companies for three years straight.  It’s also a strategy countless other entrepreneurs use to build their own multi-million dollar companies.  Build an audience and you’ll be able to sell pretty much anything you want.\n\nToday’s markets are more dynamic and customers are more fickle than ever before. Why would you put all your eggs in one basket before securing a loyal customer base? Content Inc. shows you how to get customers first and develop products later. It’s the best way to build a solid, long-lasting business positioned for today’s content-driven world.  This is the simple but profoundly successful entrepreneurial approach of one of today’s most creative business minds.\n\nA pioneer of content marketing, Pulizzi has cracked to code when it comes to the power of content in a world where marketers still hold fast to traditional models that no longer work. In Content Inc., he breaks down the business-startup process into six steps, making it simple for you to visualize, launch, and monetize your own business. These steps are:\n\n• The “Sweet Spot”: Identify the intersection of your unique competency and your personal passion • Content Tilting: Determine how you can “tilt” your sweet spot to find a place where little or no competition exists • Building the Base: Establish your number-one channel for disseminating content (blog, podcast, YouTube, etc.) • Harvesting Audience: Use social-media and SEO to convert one-time visitors into long-term subscribers • Diversification: Grow your business by expanding into multiple delivery channels • Monetization: Now that your expertise is established, you can begin charging money for your products or services\n\nThis model has worked wonders for Pulizzi and countless other examples detailed in the book. Connect these six pieces like a puzzle, and before you know it, you’ll be running your own profitable, scalable business.\n\nPulizzi walks you step by step through the process, based on his own success (and failures) and real-world multi-million dollar examples from multiple industries and countries.\n\nWhether you’re seeking to start a brand-new business or drive innovation in an existing one, Content Inc. provides everything you need to reverse-engineer the traditional entrepreneurial model for better, more sustainable success.\n\nJoe Pulizzi is an entrepreneur, professional speaker, and podcaster. He is the founder of several startups, including the Content Marketing Institute (CMI), recognized as the fastest growing business media company by Inc. magazine in 2014. CMI produces Content Marketing World, the world’s largest content marketing event, and publishes the leading content marketing magazine, Chief Content Officer.

Multi-screen Marketing: The Seven Things You Need to Know to Reach Your Customers Across TVs, Computers, Tablets, and Mobile Phones is a comprehensive guide to understanding the multi-screen consumer. Written by thought leaders from Microsoft's Advertising Division, the book identifies what drives consumer behavior across devices and digital platforms - sequentially, simultaneously, at home, at work and everywhere in between. The underlying concept is that marketers need to move beyond a technology feature-obsessed approach where a device's capabilities dictate one's marketing plan, and instead, focus on the underlying needs and motivations of their customers. This approach can help marketers simplify their strategy, while enabling them to leverage the right screen with the right message in the right moment.\n\nCompanies are learning that using the same legacy television advertising and content across all digital media will not help them break through the clutter. To truly take advantage of the unprecedented opportunity served up by the multi-screen world, the authors show how bringing consumers firmly back into focus will ultimately deliver more value for marketers. Readers will learn how to tailor their approach to most effectively reach their customers through the following multi-screen pathways:\n\nContent Grazing - uses 2+ screens for unrelated content\n\nQuantum - transitions sequential activity from one screen to another\n\nInvestigative Spider-Webbing - views related content on 2+ screens\n\nSocial Spider-Webbing - sharing and connecting with others on 2+ screens\n\nThe book includes new research and data exploring how and why consumers navigate across screens as well as real-world examples of consumer-centric multi-screen marketing from companies of all sizes embracing the change. For marketers looking to remain effective in the digital age, Multi-screen Marketing: The Seven Things You Need to Know to Reach Your Customers Across TVs, Computers, Tablets, and Mobile Phones explains how a consumer-centric multi-screen strategy not only simplifies an overly complex and constantly changing marketing landscape, but leads to multi-screen campaigns that connect consumers to brands in meaningful, enduring ways.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Marketing"]},{"id":"9781118236307","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Social Media Marketing For Dummies, 2nd Edition","authors":["Shiv Singh","Stephanie Diamond"],"pages":"408","publication_date":"April 2012","description":"Get the last word on the most up-to-date social media marketing techniques\n\nIf you're not tweeting, Facebooking, or blogging by now, your business is getting left behind.

Too much is at stake. Companies are searching for more ways to efficiently manage expanding volumes of data, and to make that data accessible throughout the enterprise. This demand is propelling the move of storage into the network. Also, the increasing complexity of managing a large numbers of storage devices and vast amounts of data is driving greater business value into software and services.\n\nWith current estimates of the amount of data to be managed and made available increasing at 60 percent each year, this outlook is where a storage area network (SAN) enters the arena.

A variety of sales technologies exist such as customer relationship management (CRM) software, mobile sales force automation (SFA) applications, contact management software, and territory planning applications, to name just a few. In spite of the amount being invested in such technologies, however, few firms can claim to be enjoying performance improvements. In fact, the majority of companies are struggling to gain salesperson buy-ins and are failing to realize the intended return on investment (ROI). In addition, the introduction of such technological applications may cause stress to the sales force or disturb customer relationships. Against this backdrop, this textbook is concerned with how executives can effectively manage a complex and costly sales technology initiative in order to get the most out of it. In particular, the textbook begins by providing the reader with a detailed discussion on the various technologies that are being used by sales organizations. It then provides an exhaustive review of the factors that might lead to effective sales technology implementation and presents a managerially relevant conceptual framework, which illuminates the mediating pathways from using the system to salesperson productivity. Moreover, the textbook offers a wide array of key performance indicators (KPIs) that can be readily employed in order to monitor the progress and success of the implementation effort. Next, it offers a comprehensive method that executives can use to calculate the return on sales technology investment (ROSTI) in order to substantiate the business case for the technology. Finally, the textbook provides executives with a detailed three-stage process of sales technology implementation and discusses what essential work should be conducted in each stage.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Sales"]},{"id":"9781449380168","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Facebook: The Missing Manual","authors":["E.

Navigating the social within the digital can be a contentious undertaking, as social networks confuse the boundary between offline and online relationships. These systems work to bring people together in an online environment, yet participation can dislocate users from other relationships and deviant ‘online’ behaviour can create ‘offline’ issues. The author begins by examining the creation of a digital presence in online networks popularized by websites such as Facebook and MySpace. The book explores how the digital presence influences how social, cultural and professional relationships are discovered, forged, maintained and broken, and journeys through the popular criticisms of social networking such as employee time-wasting, bullying, stalking, the alleged links between social networks and suicide and the decline of a user’s public image. Social networks are often treated as morally ambiguous spaces, which highlights a dissonance between digital and social literacies. This discord is approached through an exploration of the everyday undercurrents present in social networks. The discussion of the digital presence ends by addressing the intricacies of becoming ‘digitally dead’, which explores how a user removes their identity, with finality, from social networks and the entire web.\nIdentifies the undercurrents present in social networks and explores how these influence everyday life\nProvides insight into how the digital presence insidiously encroaches on offline aspects of a user’s life\nExamines the idea of becoming ‘digitally dead’ by discussing the often taboo subject of virtual and non-virtual suicide in the context of social networks","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Marketing","Digital Marketing","Social Media Marketing"]},{"id":"9781637422090","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Celebrity 2.0","authors":["Stacy Landreth Grau"],"pages":"178","publication_date":"May 2022","description":"Social media influencers rule the world!\n\nGone are the days of worshipping movie stars and athletes only for their talent.

However, the adoption of social technologies often means changing the way people work, and that means executives need to invest time and effort in explaining the purpose and value of using the new tools, as well as providing the necessary financial and organizational supports to sustain these work flow changes over time.The authors’ research is based on two surveys conducted in 2011 and 2012, as well as dozens of interviews with executives and social business thought leaders. The 2012 survey had more than 2,500 respondents from 25 industries and 99 countries. According to its findings, 52% of managers say their companies are at an early stage of developing social capabilities. For these managers, the top barriers to using social business are a lack of strategy, no business case and a lack of management understanding.The authors explain the importance of three types of senior leadership support for initiatives that rely on social technologies: (1) support for these initiatives over time, not just when they are launched, (2) executives’ own use of social technologies as a signal of their importance, and (3) a pragmatic attitude about what to measure and when to measure results from these initiatives.As marketers capitalize on social tools, the relationship between CMOs and CIOs can change, and some organizations are hiring chief digital officers, the authors note. They observe that successful social business initiatives can produce changes in the way executives work together.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Marketing","Digital Marketing","Social Media Marketing"]},{"id":"9780749483920","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Myths of Marketing","authors":["Grant Leboff"],"pages":"224","publication_date":"January 2020","description":"Enhance your marketing practices with a thought-provoking and readable overview of some of the most pervasive myths in the marketing industry, equipping readers with well-researched and practical insights.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Marketing"]},{"id":"9780857082435","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"How to Be Great at the Stuff You Hate: The Straight-Talking Guide to Networking, Persuading and Selling","authors":["Nick Davies"],"pages":"204","publication_date":"March 2012","description":"You have to do it. . . you might as well enjoy it\n\nNo one likes a pushy, smarmy salesman – no one wants to be that guy. . .but most of us need to sell to some extent.

They are Transformational Consumers, and no one knows them like Tara-Nicholle Nelson.

Over the last two decades, we’ve watched the entire world change the way it buys and stays loyal to brands. But, marketing departments are still operating in the same, campaign-centric, product-led operation that they have been following for 75 years. The most innovative companies around the world have achieved remarkable marketing results by fundamentally changing their approach. By creating value for customers through the use of owned media and the savvy use of content, these businesses have dramatically increased customer loyalty and revenue. Some of them have even taken it to the next step and developed a marketing function that actually pays for itself.\n\nKilling Marketing explores how these companies are ending the marketing as we know it--in favor of this new, exciting model.\n\nKilling Marketing provides the insight, approaches, and examples you need to understand these disruptive forces in ways that turn your marketing from cost center to revenue creator. This book builds the case for, literally, transforming the purpose of marketing within your organization. Joe Pulizzi and Robert Rose of the Content Marketing Institute show how leading companies are able sell the very content that propels their marketing strategy. You’ll learn how to:\n\n* Transform all or part of your marketing operation into a media company\n\n* Integrate this new operation into traditional marketing efforts\n\n* Develop best practices for attracting and retaining audiences\n\n* Build a strategy for competing against traditional media companies\n\n* Create a paid/earned media strategy fueled by an owned media strategy\n\nRed Bull, Johnson & Johnson, Disney and Arrow Electronics have succeeded in what ten years ago would have been deemed impossible.

The uniqueness of this book is that it tackles these trends together, and head-on. The balance of knowledge and feeling makes it an important book in a field plagued by one-sided pro- and anti- pieces.–David Arnold, author of The Mirage of Global Markets\n\nMillions of people around the world have come to despise the United States. One of the biggest reasons is American \"in-your-face\" marketing, which treats people everywhere as 24 × 7 consumers, drives U.S. free market materialism at the expense of local values, and seeks to \"McDonaldize\" the entire globe.\n\nIn this book, one of the world's leading experts on global marketing steps back to see its true impact. Johny K. Johansson looks at American marketing from the perspective of the non-U.S. consumer: as the first wave of a cultural assault by an arrogant, wasteful society of overfed, gas-guzzling, SUV-driving bullies.\n\nJohansson considers the Bush administration's \"repositioning\" of America and the post-9/11 collapse of American popularity from the perspective of a professional global marketer. He then offers practical guidance for marketers who wish to succeed in global markets without becoming \"ugly Americans.\"\n\nMeet the new \"ugly American\"–American marketers abroad: loud, short-sighted, and ineffective\n\nLive by the brand, die by the brand–Why American brands are the #1 targets of the anti-globalization movement\n\nOne size does not fit all–No matter how much global marketers say it does\n\nAfter 9/11: The disastrous \"repositioning\" of America–Bush unilateralism versus traditional American values\n\nToward a more humane global marketing–Local awareness and respect and the long-term route to sustainable profit\n\nThe new global rebellion against American marketing\n\n\"In-your-face\" American marketing–the not-so-hidden cause of global anti-Americanism.\n\nThe \"repositioning\" of America and why American popularity overseas has collapsed\n\nHow to profitably market internationally, without promoting anti-Americanism\n\nA desperately needed wake-up call for American companies in global markets\n\nIn Your Face reveals the new worldwide rebellion that's brewing against American marketing. Renowned international marketing expert Johny K. Johansson explains why global customers will no longer put up with the traditional tactics of western companies. Most important, he offers a new path to sustainable profits–a path based on respect, not domination.\n\nAlong the way, Johansson shows why American brands are especially susceptible to attack, how global politics is reshaping the playing field for U.S. companies, and how to overcome the hidden \"one-size-fits-all\" ethnocentrism that's fatal to marketers abroad.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Marketing"]},{"id":"9780132378727","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Marketing Your New Business","authors":["Bruce R.

Academic libraries, however, are as relevant as they have been historically, as their primary functions within their university missions have not changed, but merely evolved. Going beyond the Gate Count argues that the problem is not relevance, but marketing and articulation. This book offers theoretical reasoning and practical advice to directors on how to better market the function of the library within and beyond the home institution. The aim of this text is to help directors, and ultimately, their librarians and staff get students and faculty back into the library, as a result of better articulation of the library’s importance. The first chapter explores the promotion of academic libraries and their function as educational systems.

In particular, a growing number of service organizations have been investigating the use of a sophisticated linear programming technique called DEA, or data envelopment analysis. (In this article, the authors use the term “balanced benchmarking” to denote DEA.) The technique enables companies to benchmark and locate best practices that are not visible through other commonly used management methodologies.Today, balanced benchmarking can be used by anyone with Microsoft Excel, but it was not always so easy. When it was first introduced in the 1980s, balanced benchmarking was an academic tool for measuring and managing relative efficiency of peer organizations.Balanced benchmarking simultaneously considers the multiple resources used to generate multiple services, along with the quality of the services provided. It also provides managers with a sophisticated mechanism to assess the performance of different service providers — comparing, for example, the London and Tokyo offices of a global advertising agency — by going well beyond crude metrics and ratios such as profitability and account billings per employee. A company can identify its least efficient offices or business units, and it can assess the magnitude of the inefficiency and investigate potential paths for improvement. Moreover, executives can study the top-performing units, identify the best practices and transfer that valuable knowledge throughout the organization. Lastly, balanced benchmarking enables companies to test their assumptions, particularly before implementing initiatives that might inadvertently be counterproductive.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Sales","Customer Service"]},{"id":"9781119005742","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Samsung Galaxy Tab S For Dummies","authors":["Dan Gookin"],"pages":"304","publication_date":"May 2015","description":"Explore your Galaxy Tab S with an expert tour guide at your side\n\nSamsung Galaxy Tab S For Dummies is a user-friendly guide to getting the most out of your new tablet.

We browse books on Amazon with awareness of how other customers liked (or disliked) a particular tome. On Expedia, we compare hotels based on user ratings. On YouTube, we can check out a video’s thumbs-up/thumbs-down score to help determine if it’s worth our time. For the most part, consumers have faith in online ratings and view them as trustworthy. But, the author argues, this trust may be misplaced. The heart of the problem lies with our herd instincts — natural human impulses characterized by a lack of individual decision making — that cause us to think and act in the same way as other people around us. When it comes to online ratings, our herd instincts combine with our susceptibility to positive “social influence.” When we see that other people have appreciated a certain book, enjoyed a hotel or restaurant or liked a particular doctor, this can cause us to feel the same positive feelings and to provide a similarly high online rating. The author describes an experiment that he and two colleagues conducted on a social news-aggregation website. On the site, users rate news articles and comments by voting them up or down based on how much they enjoyed them. The researchers randomly manipulated the scores of comments with a single up or down vote and then measured the impact of these small manipulations on subsequent scores. The results were striking. The positive manipulations created a positive social influence bias that persisted over five months and that ultimately increased the comments’ final ratings by 25%. Negatively manipulated scores, meanwhile, were offset by a correction effect that neutralized the manipulation: Although viewers of negatively manipulated comments were more likely to vote negative (evidence of negative herding), they were even more likely to positively “correct” what they saw as an undeserved negative score.This social-influence bias snowballs into disproportionately high scores, creating a tendency toward positive ratings bubbles. Positively manipulated scores were 30% more likely than control comments (the comments that the researchers did not manipulate) to reach or exceed a score of 10. A positive vote didn’t just affect the mean of the ratings distribution; it pushed the upper tail of the distribution out as well, meaning a single positive vote at the beginning could propel comments to ratings stardom.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Marketing","Content Marketing"]},{"id":"9780749471088","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Stickier Marketing, 2nd Edition","authors":["Grant Leboff"],"pages":"272","publication_date":"February 2014","description":"Move away from the old marketing system of shouting messages at people to a new model of customer engagement, where you can attract customers by providing value and becoming 'sticky'.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Marketing"]},{"id":"9781606498408","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"A Beginner's Guide to Mobile Marketing","authors":["Karen Mishra","Molly Garris"],"pages":"147","publication_date":"December 2014","description":"This book is for marketers (from newbies to CMO level) who want to learn why and how to use mobile marketing to engage and convert consumers.

Market sensing can be considered an expression of a company’s capabilities to scan the external environment. It does this by using real time data and intelligence to understand business or uncertain changes, to meet the current and future needs of the market, increase customer value, and outperform competitors. Market sensing enables managers to resist complacency, as well as to exploit opportunities and to design appropriate competitive strategies in order to remain successful in today’s uncertain, rapidly changing, and hypercompetitive market. Market Sensing Today is essential reading in the marketing discipline, given the rapidly escalating innovative developments in market sensing techniques. This book of essays by acknowledged experts in the field fills an important knowledge gap and provides a realistic basis for strategy. It is replete with real-life examples of market sensing that illustrate actionable ideas for immediate impact that will improve organizational learning and accelerate growth.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Marketing"]},{"id":"9781631573583","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Shopper Marketing","authors":["Paul Barnett"],"pages":"265","publication_date":"January 2016","description":"The book follows the story of the Big Beverage Company, a large multinational company, whose main source of profit is coffee.

In recent years, social media and online ratings have given businesses new ways to learn about customers’ opinions about their products. Today, however, some of the products themselves -- at least those devices that are part of the connected world of the Internet of Things -- are starting to provide unprecedented levels of information that can be used to improve both the products and the customer experience.\n\nIn particular, information from connected devices offers companies three tremendously important core pieces of contextual information that were previously unavailable: where the products are being used, how they are being used, and which customers are using them at any given time. Going forward, the authors expect that companies that manufacture smart, connected products will have an advantage in the market.\n\nFor instance, a company does not have to wait until a customer calls with a complaint to know that a product connected to the Internet of Things is not working correctly; the product has already communicated the information. With this advance knowledge, the company can report an issue to a customer and seek to address it before it becomes a bigger problem. This service call could also turn into a sales call if the company adds a new feature that gives the product additional capabilities.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Sales","Customer Service"]},{"id":"9781849511308","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Elgg 1.8 Social Networking","authors":["Cash Costello"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"February 2012","description":"Explore the world of social networking creation with 'Elgg 1.8 Social Networking' by Cash Costello.

As storage takes precedence, three major initiatives have emerged: - Infrastructure simplification: Consolidation, virtualization, and automated management with IBM TotalStorage can help simplify the infrastructure and ensure an organization meets its business goals. - Information lifecycle management: Managing business data through its life cycle from conception until disposal in a manner that optimizes storage and access at the lowest cost. - Business continuity: Maintaining access to data at all times, protecting critical business assets, and aligning recovery costs based on business risk and information value. Storage is no longer an afterthought. Too much is at stake. Companies are searching for more ways to efficiently manage expanding volumes of data, and to make that data accessible throughout the enterprise; this is propelling the move of storage into the network. Also, the increasing complexity of managing large numbers of storage devices and vast amounts of data is driving greater business value into software and services. With current estimates of data to be managed and made available increasing at 60 percent per annum, this is where a storage area network (SAN) enters the arena. Simply put, SANs are the leading storage infrastructure for the global economy of today. SANs offer simplified storage management, scalability, flexibility, availability, and improved data access, movement, and backup. This IBM Redbook gives an introduction to the SAN. It illustrates where SANs are today, who are the main industry organizations and standard bodies active in the SAN world, and it positions IBM's comprehensive, best-of-breed approach of enabling SANs with its products and services.

Due to their complementary orientations and objectives, these two functions are ideally positioned for a fruitful, synergetic collaboration. UnfortuÂnately, the practical reality in many companies is far removed from this utopia. Sales and marketing personnel fail to communicate effectively, resulting in misunderstandings, frustration, and sometimes sabotage. Instead of supporting each other in creating superior value for customers, they often fight tiresome internal battles that are a drain on profits, efficiency and customer satisfaction. Improving Sales and Marketing Collaboration offers the first comprehensive perspective on the functioning of sales-marketing interfaces in business to business (B2B) companies. We explore their complementary roles in creating superior value for customers, problems that occur, the underlying causes of these problems, and potential solutions. These solutions are accompanied by a series of tools that managers can use to diagnose their sales-marketing interface and develop appropriate approaches to improve this relationship. Additionally, the book discusses a number of challenges that companies encounter and the impacts on their sales-marketing interfaces. The discussions and tools presented in this book provide managers with a deep underÂstanding of this critical interface, allowing them to apply these insights to improve their sales-marketing interface, which helps them create superior value for customers.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Sales"]},{"id":"9781606491713","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Inscrutable Shopper","authors":["Stella Minahan"],"pages":"153","publication_date":"September 2011","description":"The book highlights research undertaken by marketers, social researchers and anthropologists who have an interest in this field.

Yet the average tenure of a chief marketing officer (CMO) is three and a half years, well below that of the typical CEO. Both the prevalence of the CMO position and its precariousness give rise to the question,“ Has marketing realized the vision to which its adherents have long aspired?”\n\nThe authors look at the IMB 2011 Global CMO Study to extrapolate trends in marketing. In the study, more than 1,700 CMOs were asked to rate how much influence they have over four key aspects of marketing. They were also asked to what extent their marketing organization captures, analyzes and acts on customer data. The authors calculate an overall metric, the “Full-Scale Marketing Index”, to measure average control over each of the four aspects, plus use of data. From their findings they explore whether it is important to follow the “Marketing Ideal” established over 60 years ago, and where Marketing goes from here.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Marketing"]},{"id":"9781606491508","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Marketing Strategy in Play","authors":["Mark Hill"],"pages":"125","publication_date":"June 2010","description":"The ideas presented in this book explain marketing thinking and how to cultivate it, and ultimately, the ways in which marketplace differences are created.

Various experts have ventured theories about what kind of content makes for a hit. The advice varies widely and is even contradictory. Depending on the expert, success is thought more likely if a video is humorous, shocking, dramatic, topical, warm, arousing, angry, scary, socially beneficial, cute, violent, sexy, uplifting, intriguing, quirky, interesting, authoritative, tear-jerking, educational, controversial or baby- and animal-filled. One of the reasons for the various views is that researchers have often looked at only popular videos and did not compare the popular clips with the content almost no one saw. To see if they could clarify some of the contradictions, the authors examined a mix of popular and unpopular videos, then systematically coded and empirically tested the effect of each element on some relatively objective and observational measures of viewer engagement. The authors assigned a team of research assistants to watch 750 videos and to independently score each on a range of attributes. Did the video feature babies, attempt to be funny or use sexually suggestive content? How would watching the video make the typical viewer feel? They collected information on dozens of different video elements and correlated these with three measures of engagement: the number of times people left comments on the video, the overall “liking” index for each video (calculated by subtracting the number of “dislikes” from “likes”) and the number of views. The authors’ key finding? Emotionally surprising videos generated liking and views more than any kind of specific content element they studied. The authors also looked at novel and incongruous content and found that both were associated with feelings of surprise, which increased views and liking. To get viewers’ attention by surprising them, marketers have two good choices: Show viewers something they have never seen before, or show them two things they are familiar with but in an original, juxtaposed way.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Marketing","Content Marketing"]},{"id":"9781836200390","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Microsoft Identity and Access Administrator SC-300 Exam Guide - Second Edition","authors":["Aaron Guilmette","James Hardiman","Doug Haven"],"pages":"594","publication_date":"March 2025","description":"The \"Microsoft Identity and Access Administrator SC-300 Exam Guide\" is your ultimate resource to master the SC-300 Microsoft certification exam.

SAP ABAP uses numerous hands on business oriented use cases and a valuable dedicated e-resource to demonstrate the underlying advanced concepts of the OO ABAP environment and the SAP UI. SAP ABAP covers the latest version (NetWeaver 7.3 and SAP application programming release 6.0) of the platform for demonstrating the customization and implementation phases of the SAP software implementation.\n\nShorn of weighty theoretical treatment and preoccupation with language syntax, SAP ABAP is a comprehensive, practical one stop solution,which demonstrates and conveys the language’s commands and features through hands on examples. The accompanying e-resource is a take off point to the book.\n\nSAP ABAP works in tandem with the accompanying e-resource to create an interactive learning environment where the book provides a brief description and an overview of a specified feature/command followed by the user switching over to the accompanying e-resource, where a step-by-step guide to creating and running the feature’s object is available.\n\nThe presentation of the features is scenario oriented, i.e. most of the features are demonstrated in terms of small business scenarios. The e-resource contains the scenario descriptions, screen shots, detailed screen cams and ABAP program source to enable the reader to create all objects related to the scenario and run/execute them.\n\nThe underlying concepts of a feature/command are conveyed through execution of these hands-on programs. Further exercises to be performed independently by the reader are also proposed.

Buyers have more power—more information, more at stake, and more control over the sales process—than any time in history. Technology is bringing disruptive change at an ever-increasing pace, creating fear and uncertainty that leaves buyers clinging to the status quo. Deteriorating attention spans have made it difficult to get buyers to sit still long enough to “challenge,” “teach,” “help,” give “insight,” or sell “value.” And a relentless onslaught of “me-too” competitors have made differentiating on the attributes of products, services, or even price more difficult than ever.\n\nLegions of salespeople and their leaders are coming face to face with a cold hard truth: what once gave salespeople a competitive edge—controlling the sales process, command of product knowledge, an arsenal of technology, and a great pitch—are no longer guarantees of success. Yet this is where the vast majority of the roughly $20 billion spent each year on sales training goes.  It’s no wonder many companies are seeing 50 percent or more of their salespeople miss quota.  \n\nYet, in this new paradigm, an elite group of top 1 percent sales professionals are crushing it. In our age of technology where information is ubiquitous and buyer attention spans are fleeting, these superstars have learned how to leverage a new psychology of selling—Sales EQ—to keep prospects engaged, create true competitive differentiation, as well as shape and influence buying decisions. These top earners are acutely aware that the experience of buying from them is far more important than products, prices, features, and solutions.\n\nIn Sales EQ, Jeb Blount takes you on an unprecedented journey into the behaviors, techniques, and secrets of the highest earning salespeople in every industry and field. You’ll learn:\n\nHow to answer the 5 Most Important Questions in Sales to make it virtually impossible for prospects to say no\nHow to master 7 People Principles that will give you the power to influence anyone to do almost anything\nHow to shape and align the 3 Processes of Sales to lock out competitors and shorten the sales cycle\nHow to Flip the Buyer Script to gain complete control of the sales conversation\nHow to Disrupt Expectations to pull buyers towards you, direct their attention, and keep them engaged\nHow to leverage Non-Complementary Behavior to eliminate resistance, conflict, and objections\nHow to employ the Bridge Technique to gain the micro-commitments and next steps you need to keep your deals from stalling\nHow to tame Irrational Buyers, shake them out of their comfort zone, and shape the decision making process\nHow to measure and increase you own Sales EQ using the 15 Sales Specific Emotional Intelligence Markers\nAnd so much more!  \n\nSales EQ begins where The Challenger Sale, Strategic Selling, and Spin Selling leave off. It addresses the human relationship gap in the modern sales process at a time when sales organizations are failing because many salespeople have never been taught the human skills required to effectively engage buyers at the emotional level.  Jeb Blount makes a compelling case that sales specific emotional intelligence (Sales EQ) is more essential to success than education, experience, industry awareness, product knowledge, skills, or raw IQ; and, sales professionals who invest in developing and improving Sales EQ gain a decisive competitive advantage in the hyper-competitive global marketplace.\n\nSales EQ arms salespeople and sales leaders with the tool","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Sales"]},{"id":"9781118962701","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Business Development For Dummies","authors":["Anna Kennedy"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"April 2015","description":"Growing a small business requires more than just sales\n\nBusiness Development For Dummies helps maximise the growth of small- or medium-sized businesses, with a step-by-step model for business development designed specifically for B2B or B2C service firms.

Use Scala and Clojure to solve in-depth problems with two sets of patterns: object-oriented patterns that become more concise with functional programming, and natively functional patterns. Your code will be more declarative, with fewer bugs and lower maintenance costs.Functional languages have their own patterns that enable you to solve problems with less code than object-oriented programming alone. This book introduces you, the experienced Java programmer, to Scala and Clojure: practical, production-quality languages that run on the JVM and interoperate with existing Java. By using both the statically typed, type-inferred Scala and the dynamically typed, modern Lisp Clojure, you'll gain a broad understanding of functional programming.For each pattern, you'll first see the traditional object-oriented solution, and then dig into the functional replacements in both Scala and Clojure. These patterns are common in the functional world and deserve to become part of your problem-solving toolkit. On the object-oriented side, you'll see many common patterns, such as Command, Strategy, and Null Object. On the functional side, you'll learn core functional patterns such as Memoization, Lazy Sequence, and Tail Recursion.Each pattern helps you solve a common programming problem. Working through them gives you a set of patterns you can use to solve problems you come across while writing programs. Finally, you'll learn how to work your existing Java code into new Scala or Clojure projects. You can start off small, adding functional code little by little, so you can complement your existing knowledge with Scala and Clojure as these languages gain popularity on the JVM.","tags":["Software Development","Programming Languages","JVM Languages","Scala"]},{"id":"9781119167969","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Customer Success","authors":["Nick Mehta","Dan Steinman","Lincoln Murphy"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"February 2016","description":"Your business success is now forever linked to the success of your customers\n\nCustomer Success is the groundbreaking guide to the exciting new model of customer management.

Braun"],"pages":"400","publication_date":"September 2012","description":"This is the first book primarily about the satellite payload of satellite communications systems. It represents a unique combination of practical systems engineering and communications theory. It tells about the satellites in geostationary and low-earth orbits today, both the so-called bent-pipe payloads and the processing payloads. The on-orbit environment, mitigated by the spacecraft bus, is described. The payload units (e.g. antennas and amplifiers), as well as payload-integration elements (e.g. waveguide and switches) are discussed in regard to how they work, what they do to the signal, their technology, environment sensitivity, and specifications. At a higher level are discussions on the payload as an entity: architecture including redundancy; specifications--what they mean, how they relate to unit specifications, and how to verify; and specification-compliance analysis (\"budgets\") with uncertainty. Aspects of probability theory handy for calculating and using uncertainty and variation are presented. The highest-level discussions, on the end-to-end communications system, start with a practical introduction to physical-layer communications theory. Atmospheric effects and interference on the communications link are described. A chapter gives an example of optimizing a multibeam payload via probabilistic analysis. Finally, practical tips on system simulation and emulation are provided. The carrier frequencies treated are 1 GHz and above. Familiarity with Fourier analysis will enhance understanding of some topics. References are provided throughout the book for readers who want to dig deeper.\n\nPayload systems engineers, payload proposal writers, satellite-communications systems designers and analysts, and satellite customers will find that the book cuts their learning time. Spacecraft-bus systems engineers, payload unit engineers, and spacecraft operators will gain insight into the overall system. Students in systems engineering, microwave engineering, communications theory, probability theory, and communications simulation and modelling will find examples to supplement theoretical texts.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Engineering","Satellites"]},{"id":"9781484287415","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Marketing for Small B2B Businesses: How Content Creates Marketing Muscle and Powers Traditional and Digital Marketing","authors":["Andrew Schulkind"],"pages":"226","publication_date":"December 2022","description":"Small business marketers don’t need to understand technical minutia of websites or the high-level social media strategies of national consumer brands.

Without the baggage of legacy frameworks and virtual machines, Scala Native lets you re-imagine how your programs interact with your operating system. Compile Scala code down to native machine instructions; seamlessly invoke operating system APIs for low-level networking and IO; control pointers, arrays, and other memory management techniques for extreme performance; and enjoy instant start-up times. Skip the JVM and improve your code performance by getting close to the metal.\n\nDevelopers generally build systems on top of the work of those who came before, accumulating layer upon layer of abstraction. Scala Native provides a rare opportunity to remove layers. Without the JVM, Scala Native uses POSIX and ANSI C APIs to build concise, expressive programs that run unusually close to bare metal. Scala Native compiles Scala code down to native machine instructions instead of JVM bytecode. It starts up fast, without the sluggish warm-up phase that's common for just-in-time compilers. Scala Native programs can seamlessly invoke operating system APIs for low-level networking and IO. And Scala Native lets you control pointers, arrays, and other memory layout types for extreme performance.\n\nWrite practical, bare-metal code with Scala Native, step by step. Understand the foundations of systems programming, including pointers, arrays, strings, and memory management. Use the UNIX socket API to write network client and server programs without the sort of frameworks higher-level languages rely on. Put all the pieces together to design and implement a modern, asynchronous microservice-style HTTP framework from scratch.\n\nTake advantage of Scala Native's clean, modern syntax to write lean, high-performance code without the JVM.\n\nWhat You Need:\n\nA modern Windows, Mac OS, or Linux system capable of running Docker. All code examples in the book are designed to run on a portable Docker-based build environment that runs anywhere.

It has since escalated in importance as system providers increased their market penetration of the business market and, in parallel, CRM’s strategic importance gained more traction as it was recognized that CRM was, at its heart, a business model in the pursuit of sustainable profit.\n\nThis was accentuated by the academic community stepping up their interest in the subject in the early 2000’s. Today, it is a universal business topic which has been re-engineered by the online shopping revolution in which the customer is firmly placed at the center of the business. The current reality, however, is that, for the vast majority of businesses, CRM has not been adopted as a business philosophy and practicing business model. It has not been fully understood and therefore fully embraced and properly implemented.\n\nThe author addresses this head-on by stripping CRM down into its component parts by delving into and explaining the role and relevance of the C, R, and M in CRM. This is a practical guide but set within a strategic framework. The outage is clear actionable insights and how to convert them into delivery. It is written in an easily digestible, non-jargon style, with case studies to demonstrate how CRM works. This book can be immediately used as the primary practical reference to guide the development and implementation of a CRM strategy.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Sales","Customer Relationship Management (CRM)"]},{"id":"158705065X","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Storage Area Network Fundamentals","authors":["Meeta Gupta"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"April 2002","description":"A guide to planning, implementing, managing, and using storage area networks to increase the efficiency of your network infrastructure\n\nGain in-depth coverage of SAN fundamentals, topologies, implementation and management techniques, and products\n\nBuild and sharpen your troubleshooting skills for data-mining, online transaction processing, imaging, data warehousing, and other highly data-intensive applications\n\nUnderstand how to implement the Fibre Channel and iSCSI protocols, which are key to any SAN solution\n\nLearn current industry implementation and application standards, as well as future advances\n\nDuring the last decade, a multitude of changes in computing technology and the globalization of business through the Internet have resulted in a tremendous growth in storage requirements.

SAP solutions provide a rich set of composable application modules, and configurable functional capabilities that are expected from a comprehensive enterprise business application software suite.\n\nIn most cases, companies that adopt SAP software remain heterogeneous enterprises running both SAP and non-SAP systems to support their business processes. Regardless of the specific scenario, in heterogeneous enterprises most SAP implementations must be integrated with a variety of non-SAP enterprise systems:\n\nPortals\n\nMessaging infrastructure\n\nBusiness process management (BPM) tools\n\nEnterprise Content Management (ECM) methods and tools\n\nBusiness analytics (BA) and business intelligence (BI) technologies\n\nSecurity\n\nSystems of record\n\nSystems of engagement\n\nThe tooling included with SAP software addresses many needs for creating SAP-centric environments. However, the classic approach to implementing SAP functionality generally leaves the business with a rigid solution that is difficult and expensive to change and enhance.\n\nWhen SAP software is used in a large, heterogeneous enterprise environment, SAP clients face the dilemma of selecting the correct set of tools and platforms to implement SAP functionality, and to integrate the SAP solutions with non-SAP systems.\n\nThis IBM® Redbooks® publication explains the value of integrating IBM software with SAP solutions. It describes how to enhance and extend pre-built capabilities in SAP software with best-in-class IBM enterprise software, enabling clients to maximize return on investment (ROI) in their SAP investment and achieve a balanced enterprise architecture approach. This book describes IBM Reference Architecture for SAP, a prescriptive blueprint for using IBM software in SAP solutions. The reference architecture is focused on defining the use of IBM software with SAP, and is not intended to address the internal aspects of SAP components.\n\nThe chapters of this book provide a specific reference architecture for many of the architectural domains that are each important for a large enterprise to establish common strategy, efficiency, and balance. The majority of the most important architectural domain topics, such as integration, process optimization, master data management, mobile access, Enterprise Content Management, business intelligence, DevOps, security, systems monitoring, and so on, are covered in the book.\n\nHowever, there are several other architectural domains which are not included in the book. This is not to imply that these other architectural domains are not important or are less important, or that IBM does not offer a solution to address them. It is only reflective of time constraints, available resources, and the complexity of assembling a book on an extremely broad topic.\n\nAlthough more content could have been added, the authors feel confident that the scope of architectural material that has been included should provide organizations with a fantastic head start in defining their own enterprise reference architecture for many of the important architectural domains, and it is hoped that this book provides great value to those reading it.\n\nThis IBM Redbooks publication is targeted to the following audiences:\n\nClient decision makers and solution architects leading enterprise transformation projects and wanting to gain further insight so that they can benefit from the integration of IBM software in large-scale SAP projects.\n\nIT architects and consultants integrating IBM technology with SAP solutions.","tags":["Data","Data Engineering","SAP"]},{"id":"9781000317862","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Influencer","authors":["T.

Phillips","Patricia Pulliam Phillips"],"pages":"264","publication_date":"February 2013","description":"It has never been more important to show examples of sales skills at work. The process to evaluate these skills is sometimes perceived as straightforward and routine, simply a matter of tracking the sales gains after the program has been conducted. But credibly Measuring the Success of Sales Training programs is a bit more involved than that. Experts in the practice of ROI measurement, Jack and Patricia Phillips have collected a new book of ROI case studies, with a focus on sales training programs. The case studies presented in this book demonstrate how to use of the ROI Methodology to properly measure the results of sales programs.\n\nThese studies come from all over the world, in many different disciplines and concentrations, from financial services to the public sector. The use of the ROI Methodology addresses issues that are sometimes omitted from other casebooks. First, since many other factors influence sales, there must always be a step to isolate the effects of the sales training program on the sales (each study features this step). Second, when converting to monetary value, only the profit margins of increased sales must be used, not the sales themselves—a mistake made by many. Third, the stream of monetary benefits for the increased profits must be conservative, usually representing only one year.\n\nSponsors need a credible, conservative approach to measuring ROI—one that meets these challenges. All of the case studies in this book will address these issues, providing examples and benchmarks for others to use to evaluate these important types of programs.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Sales"]},{"id":"9781590475041","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Analysis of Clinical Trials Using SAS","authors":["Alex Dmitrienko","Geert Molenberghs","Christy Chuang-Stein"],"pages":"430","publication_date":"February 2005","description":"In Analysis of Clinical Trials Using SAS: A Practical Guide, Alex Dmitrienko, Geert Molenberghs, Christy Chuang-Stein, and Walter Offen bridge the gap between modern statistical methodology and real-world clinical trial applications.

Traditional sales and marketing methods have failed to keep pace with the way modern, internet-savvy consumers purchase goods and services.

However, no single book has ever focused on how the integration of these two areas is creating a stronger platform for various scientific advancements—including some research work that cannot be performed on Earth.\n\nTo fill the void, Information, Communication, and Space Technology provides a novel illustration of that connection. Dividing content into sections that cover ICT, existing and future space technologies, and satellites, the author demonstrates the individual and combined power of each of these parts of the overall system. He explores how the combination of concepts from each of these interrelated fields is creating massive potential for broader advances in areas such as robotics, communications, navigation, agriculture, health care, and nanotechnology. The book introduces particular potential innovations, including \"rocket-less\" spacecraft launches, and development of a global system to balance energy distribution by using satellites that would collect solar energy and transmit it via microwave beams to different locations around the world.\n\nEqually useful to students and professionals, this work is a culmination of the domestic and international experience that the author has acquired throughout more than three decades as an instructor and researcher. Emphasizing the strong need to incorporate ICT and space technology into the general university curriculum, the book starts with basic explanations of key concepts and theories, building toward more concrete, application-oriented examples that reveal the importance and impact of new technologies.

You are well-versed with SAP’s product portfolio and you know that the preferred reporting option in S/4HANA is embedded analytics. But what exactly is embedded analytics? And how can it be implemented? And who can do it: a business user, a functional consultant specialized in financial or logistics processes? Or does a business intelligence expert or a programmer need to be involved? Good questions!\n\nThis book will answer these questions, one by one. It will also take you on the same journey that the implementation team needs to follow for every reporting requirement that pops up: start with assessing a more standard option and only move on to a less standard option if the requirement cannot be fulfilled. In consecutive chapters, analytical apps delivered by SAP, apps created using Smart Business Services, and Analytical Queries developed either using tiles or in adevelopment environment are explained in detail with practical examples. The book also explains which option is preferred in which situation. The book covers topics such as in-memory computing, cloud, UX, OData, agile development, and more.\n\nAuthor Freek Keijzer writes from the perspective of an implementation consultant, focusing on functionality that has proven itself useful in the field.

Samba is a cross-platform triumph: it turns a Unix or Linux system into a file and print server for Microsoft Windows network clients. Now you can let users store their files (and even important executables) in a single place for easy sharing and backup, protected by Unix or NT security mechanisms, and still offer such transparent access that PC users don't even realize they're going to another system. The magic behind Samba is that it recognizes and speaks the SMB protocol developed by Microsoft for file and printer sharing on its own systems. Basic Samba configuration is simple, but you'll want to make sure your security settings are just right and find out about the full range of options (how do you like your filenames mangled?). Trouble-shooting, security, connectivity, performance, and logging are thoroughly covered with examples in this book. Samba is so robust, flexible, and secure that many people are choosing it over Windows NT for their file and print services. Furthermore, Samba is proving to be a necessity for the many organizations that have an existing Unix or Linux system and want to tie in PCs running Microsoft software. Samba is also open source software, licensed under the GNU General Public License. The authors present the most common configurations and problems in an easy-to-follow manner, along with instructions for getting the most out of Samba. Whether you're playing on one note or a full three-octave range, this book will give you an efficient and secure server.

Consultative selling is analyzing the needs and challenges of your customers and selling unique services that enable your customers to reduce costs, increase profits, and improve overall business performance. The Art of Consultative Selling in IT provides a practical framework for becoming a successful consultative seller and shows how to use the blue ocean strategy to identify opportunities in areas where there is no competition.\n\nThe first section discusses the advantages of consultative selling and explores the concepts of blue oceans. In blue oceans, demand is created rather than fought over. Competition is irrelevant because the rules of the game are waiting to be established. The author explains how you can use consultative selling techniques to create your own blue oceans of unknown market space, where opportunities for growth are both rapid and profitable.\n\nIn the second section, the author defines the consultative selling framework (CSF). This framework is based on proven processes, best practices, and real-time case studies to make consultative selling a reality. It provides clear guidelines for understanding your customer’s current landscape and challenges, owning its priorities, and helping it to achieve its short-term and long-term goals. The author explains how to use CSF to generate innovative ideas and present them to your customer through profit improvement or efficiency improvement proposals.\n\nThe book concludes with examples of several innovative business improvement ideas that you can present to your customers, including Agile project management, master data management (MDM), application portfolio rationalization, and business process management (BPM). The author discusses the benefits of each methodology and lists the trigger points to think about when deciding whether the methodology can add value to a particular customer.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Sales"]},{"id":"9781119010296","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Interpretation and Application of IPSAS","authors":["Caroline Aggestam-Pontoppidan","Isabelle Andernack"],"pages":"464","publication_date":"February 2016","description":"Clear, practical IPSAS guidance, explanation, and examples\n\nInterpretation and Application of IPSAS provides practical guidance on the implementation and application of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards.

Soon consumers will be able to: Control the flow and use of personal data Build their own loyalty programs Dictate their own terms of service Tell whole markets what they want, how they want it, where and when they should be able to get it, and how much it should costAnd they will do all of this outside of any one vendor’s silo. This new landscape we’re entering is what Doc Searls calls The Intention Economyone in which demand will drive supply far more directly, efficiently, and compellingly than ever before. In this book he describes an economy driven by consumer intent, where vendors must respond to the actual intentions of customers instead of vying for the attention of many.New customer tools will provide the engine, with VRM (Vendor Relationship Management) providing the consumer counterpart to vendors’ CRM (Customer Relationship Management) systems. For example, imagine being able to change your address once for every company you deal with, or combining services from multiple companies in real time, in your own waysall while keeping an auditable accounting of every one of your interactions in the marketplace.

While SAS Viya can be used by various SAS applications, it also enables you to access analytic methods from SAS, Python, Lua, and Java, as well as through a REST interface using HTTP or HTTPS. This book focuses on the perspective of SAS Viya from Python. SAS Viya is made up of multiple components. The central piece of this ecosystem is SAS Cloud Analytic Services (CAS). CAS is the cloud-based server that all clients communicate with to run analytical methods. The Python client is used to drive the CAS component directly using objects and constructs that are familiar to Python programmers. Some knowledge of Python would be helpful before using this book; however, there is an appendix that covers the features of Python that are used in the CAS Python client. Knowledge of CAS is not required to use this book. However, you will need to have a CAS server set up and running to execute the examples in this book. With this book, you will learn how to:\nInstall the required components for accessing CAS from Python\nConnect to CAS, load data, and run simple analyses\nWork with CAS using APIs familiar to Python users\nGrasp general CAS workflows and advanced features of the CAS Python client\n\nSAS Viya : The Python Perspective covers topics that will be useful to beginners as well as experienced CAS users.

In Decoding the New Consumer Mind, award-winning consumer psychologist Kit Yarrow shares surprising insights about the new motivations and behaviors of shoppers, taking marketers where they need to be today: into the deeply psychological and often unconscious relationships that people have with products, retailers, marketing communications, and brands.\n\nDrawing on hundreds of consumer interviews and shop-alongs, Yarrow reveals the trends that define our transformed behavior. For example, when we shop we show greater emotionality, hunting for more intense experiences and seeking relief and distraction online. A profound sense of isolation and individualism shapes the way we express ourselves and connect with brands and retailers. Neurological research even suggests that our brains are rewired, altering what we crave, how we think, and where our attention goes.\n\nDecoding the New Consumer Mind provides marketers with practical ways to tap into this new consumer psychology, and Yarrow shows how to combine technology and innovation to enhance brand image; win love and loyalty through authenticity and integrity; put the consumer's needs and preferences front and center; and deliver the most emotionally intense, yet uncomplicated, experience possible. Armed with Yarrow's strategies, marketers will be able to connect more effectively with consumers—driving profit and success across the organization.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Marketing"]},{"id":"9781484269954","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"SAP SuccessFactors Talent: Volume 2: A Complete Guide to Configuration, Administration, and Best Practices: Succession and Development","authors":["Susan Traynor","Michael A.

From straightforward discounts on products to more complex omni-channel consumer competitions and contests, sales promotions play a vital role as both strategic and tactical marketing tools. Those responsible for sales promotions must deliver real results in cut-throat competitive trading environments. However, with limited understanding of the options, principles, and practices that underpin effective sales promotion planning, managers often rely on past experience or preferences to guide their decision making. Not surprisingly, many sales promotions fail to achieve their potential. Sales Promotion Decision Making serves as a vital resource for practitioners. Distilled from over 700 articles and cases, it presents the findings of comprehensive global research which explores the DNA of sales promotions, including their role, nature, and function, the critical decision-making processes, and campaign evaluation. This is supported with case studies of sales promotion planning in practice based on research conducted in FMCG and retail organizations. The book offers the reader a deeper, more comprehensive and critical expert appreciation of the core concepts that define sales promotions. This will empower decision makers, consultants, and stakeholders to make more confident, informed, and effective campaign decisions.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Sales"]},{"id":"9780137010325","language":"en","level":null,"title":"The New Language of Marketing 2.0: How to Use ANGELS to Energize Your Market","authors":["Sandy Carter"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"October 2008","description":"\"Marketing has entered a new era of rapid advance.

Bendle","Charan K. Bagga"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"April 2016","description":"A big challenge for marketing is demonstrating its business value. As the finance function becomes more powerful within companies, some see marketing’s influence as declining. One major reason is the difficulty of measuring its impact. The article has two purposes, the authors say: First, to clarify marketing metrics so that managers select the right metrics and use them appropriately; and second, to help senior managers understand when marketers are cherry-picking the data or using inappropriate metrics.\n\nThe authors assess five popular marketing metrics: market share, net promoter score, the value of a “like,” customer lifetime value, and return on investment. They conducted interviews with marketers and administered formal surveys to managers. They found that popular marketing metrics are regularly misunderstood and misused. The authors’ goal is to encourage appropriate and consistent use of popular marketing metrics.\n\nMarket Share: If the aim is to maximize the returns to shareholders, the authors argue, increased market share offers no benefit unless it eventually generates profits. Still, in a survey the authors conducted, they found that more marketing managers prioritized maximizing market share than prioritized maximizing profitability. Although, they note, companies with superior products tend to have high market share and high profitability, this does not necessarily mean that increasing market share will increase profits. Using market share as a metric of success simply because other marketers do it can be counterproductive.\n\nNet Promoter Score: Companies in a variety of industries have embraced net promoter score as a way to monitor their customer service operations. One of NPS’s strongest selling points, the authors write, is its simplicity: It’s easy for managers and employees to understand the goal of having more promoters and fewer detractors. However, they note weaknesses in how the theory has been presented to managers.Value of a “Like” The authors caution that managers shouldn’t automatically assume that differences in value between social media fans and nonfans are caused by social media marketing activity. When there are differences, managers need to investigate whether they existed prior to the social media marketing effort.\n\nCustomer Lifetime Value: Marketers often use CLV to help them decide whom to target in acquisition campaigns. The authors recommend basing CLV on the value of the customer relationship -- not the value of the customer relationship minus the acquisition costs.\n\nReturn on Investment: Although ROI may not be a perfect metric, the authors concede, it can facilitate communication with nonmarketing colleagues. But to communicate effectively, marketers must use the term in ways that nonmarketers can understand. In order to calculate ROI, there must be a return (profit associated with an investment) and an investment. Unless you have both, you cannot calculate ROI.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Marketing"]},{"id":"0131873709","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Marketing Metrics: 50+ Metrics Every Executive Should Master","authors":["Paul W.

This has never been done before.\" -- Philip Kotler, from the Foreword\n\nConsidered the single most important thought leader in the world of management, Peter Drucker had an equally significant influence on the discipline of marketing. Although he didn’t approach marketing with the same systematic rigor he reserved for management, Drucker addressed the topic in detail in his wellknown treatises on the roles of profitability and leadership, the importance of innovation, and the need to seize new opportunities.\n\nDrucker on Marketing is the first comprehensive look at the marketing wisdom of one of modern history's most influential business thinkers.\n\nA former student of Peter Drucker, William Cohen has sifted through Drucker's huge body of work, singled out his most salient ideas on marketing, and constructed them into a framework that not only outlines Drucker's marketing philosophy but provides practical advice on how to achieve marketing goals in today's business setting. The book is organized into five thematic sections:\n\nThe Ascendancy of Marketing\nInnovation and Entrepreneurship\nDrucker's Marketing Strategy\nNew Product and Service Introduction\nDrucker's Unique Marketing Insights\n\nFor Drucker, profitability should not be the main focus of a business. The customer should be; the market should be. He didn't consider marketing as one of many tools to generate profits. Rather, he viewed marketing as the driving force of business, a philosophy for defining and capturing the most enriching customer opportunities.\n\nProviding unique insight into the mind of one of the twentieth century's greatest thinkers, Drucker on Marketing is an essential read for both marketing professionals and fans of Peter Drucker.\n\nPraise for Drucker on Marketing\n\n\"Bill Cohen's interpretation of Drucker's work has never been needed more than today, when marketing spells the difference between success and failure.\" -- Frances Hesselbein, President and CEO, The Frances Hesselbein Leadership Institute\n\n\"It is my desire that those in positions of influence, especially executives, professors, and students, take Cohen's advice in this book to heart and help their organizations to help us all.\" -- Joseph A.

Monty"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"February 2014","description":"The first year of developing a new sales territory is a daunting task—especially in dog-eat-dog industries. The traditional advice is to train quickly on product, grab a customer list, start calling for appointments, discover opportunities, and close deals. In fact, almost every sales model out there is based on nothing more than \"opportunity\" management. But jumping straight to opportunity will have new salespeople—or veterans developing new territories—chasing their tails for the first year or two.\n\nAs Sales Hunting: How to Develop New Territories and Major Accounts in Half the Time Using Trust as Your Weapon details, there is a significant problem you must overcome when opening up new accounts and territories. No matter what you are selling, your prospect already has a trusted relationship with an incumbent vendor and will continue to buy from that vendor even when you have the better solution. The playing field is not level—and you're on the wrong side. So how can you compete to win?\n\n\"Trust is the grease that makes business sales effortless,\" writes sales pro and trainer Dave Monty. Opportunity metrics are important, but trust—and a few sharp insider tactics Monty reveals—is the guidepost that leads to success. His sales model therefore incorporates metrics based on trust along with traditional sales measures. That is the fuel that helps you not just turn virgin territory into a consistent revenue generator, but helps you win over potential accounts that now use competitive products.\n\nSales Hunting helps you start establishing trust before you step foot in a prospect's door, and it shows you the tactics necessary to penetrate new accounts. Once you gain access, trust can be used as systematic way to build long-lasting relationships that pay dividends well beyond that first sale you make. Among other things, this book explains:\n\nWhy most customers don't want to buy from you . . . yet\n\nWhy trust-based relationships enable you to open up territories and bag the biggest customers quickly\n\nHow to qualify and rank customers based on traits\n\nHow to get in step with the customer's buying cycle\n\nHow to establish trust-based and traditional sales metrics to guide your efforts\n\nWith advice based on Monty's twenty years of IT sales and sales management experience—along with principles confirmed by academic research—Sales Hunting is an easy-to-read book that is packed with real-life examples and prescriptions for achieving sales success. It will prove a lifesaver for any salesperson or sales manager developing a new territory or trying to penetrate new accounts.\n\nWhat you'll learn\n\nWhy traditional sales models do not work for new account acquisition.\n\nWhy long-term sales success is built on developing a trusted relationship with the customer.\n\nThe best methods for achieving first meetings.\n\nThe best solutions to lead with.\n\nHow to qualify customer and opportunities.\n\nWhere to best spend your time.\n\nHow to measure and track your success.\n\nWho this book is for\n\nSalespeople and sales managers opening new territories or trying to penetrate new accounts.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Sales"]},{"id":"9780470372814","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Walk Like a Giant, Sell Like a Madman","authors":["Ralph R.

In the end, social media is still media — that is, mediums of communication — and those new mediums can be used as badly and counterproductively as any traditional mode.\n\nTo show how companies can create a winning strategy, the authors contrast the experiences of two companies — an unnamed technology company and Tupperware Nordic, the Scandinavian branch of the kitchenware company. The technology company focused on software to facilitate social networking, not on using those new tools to build communities. It also tended to communicate in ways employees found insincere. Between insincere messages from the executive team and easier communication with other disgruntled employees, the initiative had no real positive effects for the company. Tupperware, by contrast, used the technology to help the company convey community spirit to its sales associates and took advantage of social media’s unique ability to foster better vertical and horizontal communication.\n\nThe authors conclude that although social media can help create closer and more dynamic stakeholder relationships, success with an online community requires a leader who can build emotional capital and who values community building as a means of creating economic value.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Marketing","Digital Marketing","Social Media Marketing"]},{"id":"9780123822291","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Analyzing Social Media Networks with NodeXL","authors":["Derek Hansen","Ben Shneiderman","Marc A.

The traditional advice is to train quickly on products, grab a customer list, start calling for appointments, discover opportunities, and close deals. In fact, almost every sales model out there is based on nothing more than \"opportunity\" management. But jumping straight to opportunity will leave salespeople chasing their tails and coming up short on payday.\n\nWith an emphasis on basic sales skills that have been refreshed for today's generation of buyers, Trust-Based Selling shows there is a significant problem you must overcome when opening up new accounts and territories. No matter what you are selling, your prospect already has a trusted relationship with an incumbent vendor and will continue to buy from that vendor even when you have the better solution. The playing field is not level—and you’re on the wrong side. So how can you compete to win?\n\n\"Trust is the grease that makes business sales effortless,\" writes sales pro and trainer Dave Monty in this quick-read book. Opportunity metrics are important, but trust—and a few sharp insider tactics Monty reveals—is the guidepost that leads to success. Trust-Based Selling—an abridgement of Monty's Sales Hunting—helps you start establishing trust before you step foot in a prospect’s door, and it shows you the tactics necessary to penetrate new accounts. It also explains:\n\nThe new basic sales skills as taught by master salesman Dave Monty\nWhy trust-based relationships enable you to get and keep customers for life\nHow to get in step with the customer’s buying cycle\nHow to establish trust-based and traditional sales metrics to guide your efforts\n\nWith advice based on Monty’s twenty years of IT sales and sales management experience—along with principles confirmed by academic research—Trust-Based Selling is a fast read that is packed with real-life examples and prescriptions for achieving sales success.

Noble"],"pages":"5","publication_date":"April 2014","description":"Although companies have invested heavily in technology and other resources to provide better customer service, many businesses are finding that being able to create satisfied and loyal customers is more difficult today. Hurdles include a daunting rise in customer expectations; challenges posed by the Internet, social media and online word of mouth; and poor execution of upgraded corporate complaint-handling policies.Since the 1970s, the authors have conducted six customer satisfaction surveys patterned after a baseline survey by the U.S. Office of Consumer Affairs. Their latest survey found that:• The explosion of online social networking and other communication tools has raised the stakes in the area of customer satisfaction.• The intensity of negative reactions seems to be increasing.• In addressing complaints, companies are failing in their efforts to create one-stop services with technology and people dedicated to resolving customer problems.So, what can companies do to improve the level of customer satisfaction? The authors identify five areas of focus.1. Encourage unhappy customers to complain, but be prepared to resolve the complaints. Today’ unhappy customers expect businesses to handle customer service flawlessly (even if it is outsourced to a third party).2. Understand what results your investments in customer service will produce. Since the 1970s, companies have invested billions of dollars in upgraded corporate complaint-handling practices. Only 20% of recent complainants were “completely satisfied” with the results of their complaint (compared to 23% in 1976).3. Recognize that technology has limits — and that some customers want to interact directly with a person. Only 6% of today’s complainants consider the Internet their primary channel for complaining. The authors say that online communication channels might be utilized more effectively to steer customers to live complaint handlers rather than pursuing totally automated solutions.4. Be aware that customers may be even more influenced by positive online word of mouth than by negative word of mouth. By a margin of 46% to 19%, prospective buyers cited positive posts more often than negative comments as being most influential on their future purchases.5. For most customers, customer dissatisfaction is about more than money. Only 26% of survey respondents wanted financial compensation for their lost time, inconvenience or injury. Many more people seek nonmonetary remedies, such as an explanation or apology.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Sales","Customer Service"]},{"id":"9781118526309","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Selling Through Someone Else: How to Use Agile Sales Networks and Partners to Sell More","authors":["Robert Wollan","Naveen Jain","Michael Heald"],"pages":"376","publication_date":"January 2013","description":"Experience the growth multiplier effect through transforming the distribution and sales network\n\nSelling Through Someone Else tackles new opportunities to drive company growth by taking a fresh look at the customer smart distribution and sales process.

SAP solutions provide a rich set of composable application modules, and configurable functional capabilities that are expected from a comprehensive enterprise business application software suite.\n\nIn most cases, companies that adopt SAP software remain heterogeneous enterprises running both SAP and non-SAP systems to support their business processes. Regardless of the specific scenario, in heterogeneous enterprises most SAP implementations must be integrated with a variety of non-SAP enterprise systems:\n\nPortals\n\nMessaging infrastructure\n\nBusiness process management (BPM) tools\n\nEnterprise Content Management (ECM) methods and tools\n\nBusiness analytics (BA) and business intelligence (BI) technologies\n\nSecurity\n\nSystems of record\n\nSystems of engagement\n\nThe tooling included with SAP software addresses many needs for creating SAP-centric environments. However, the classic approach to implementing SAP functionality generally leaves the business with a rigid solution that is difficult and expensive to change and enhance.\n\nWhen SAP software is used in a large, heterogeneous enterprise environment, SAP clients face the dilemma of selecting the correct set of tools and platforms to implement SAP functionality, and to integrate the SAP solutions with non-SAP systems.\n\nThis IBM® Redbooks® publication explains the value of integrating IBM software with SAP solutions. It describes how to enhance and extend pre-built capabilities in SAP software with best-in-class IBM enterprise software, enabling clients to maximize return on investment (ROI) in their SAP investment and achieve a balanced enterprise architecture approach. This book describes IBM Reference Architecture for SAP, a prescriptive blueprint for using IBM software in SAP solutions. The reference architecture is focused on defining the use of IBM software with SAP, and is not intended to address the internal aspects of SAP components.\n\nThe chapters of this book provide a specific reference architecture for many of the architectural domains that are each important for a large enterprise to establish common strategy, efficiency, and balance. The majority of the most important architectural domain topics, such as integration, process optimization, master data management, mobile access, Enterprise Content Management, business intelligence, DevOps, security, systems monitoring, and so on, are covered in the book.\n\nHowever, there are several other architectural domains which are not included in the book. This is not to imply that these other architectural domains are not important or are less important, or that IBM does not offer a solution to address them. It is only reflective of time constraints, available resources, and the complexity of assembling a book on an extremely broad topic.\n\nAlthough more content could have been added, the authors feel confident that the scope of architectural material that has been included should provide organizations with a fantastic head start in defining their own enterprise reference architecture for many of the important architectural domains, and it is hoped that this book provides great value to those reading it.\n\nThis IBM Redbooks publication is targeted to the following audiences:\n\nClient decision makers and solution architects leading enterprise transformation projects and wanting to gain further insight so that they can benefit from the integration of IBM software in large-scale SAP projects.\n\nIT architects and consultants integrating IBM technology with SAP solutions.","tags":["Data","Data Engineering","SAP"]},{"id":"9781118167779","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Optimize: How to Attract and Engage More Customers by Integrating SEO, Social Media, and Content Marketing","authors":["Lee Odden"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"April 2012","description":"Attract, engage, and inspire your customers with an \"Optimize and Socialize\" content marketing strategy\n\nOptimize is designed to give readers a practical approach to integrating search and social media optimization with content marketing to boost relevance, visibility, and customer engagement.

By applying these principles, you'll open more doors, increase your productivity, speed up decisions, and close more deals.\"\n\n--Jill Konrath, author of SNAP Selling and Selling to Big Companies\n\nUsing Technology to Sell: Tactics to Ratchet Up Results shows salespeople and sales managers the most effective ways to leverage a variety of technologies to increase sales and gain more customers. Topics include making the most of cloud-based customer relationship management software, putting social media to the best use, presenting on three continents simultaneously through advanced video conferencing, using advanced techniques to gain an information edge over competitors, and much more.\n\nAs this book shows, while the sales process will remain pretty much the same from now until the end of time, technology used properly can increase sales power at every step of the cycle. Technology, in the right hands, is a strategic weapon and a competitive differentiation tool that can dramatically improve close rates, deal size, efficiency, total sales, and much more. Using Technology to Sell will show you how to:\n\nExpand your market through the use of technology.\n\nEmploy software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications to keep track of customers, stay organized, present, and sell more systematically.\n\nUse social media to increase sales.\n\nMaintain the personal element in a world wired with technology.\n\nUse the best sales methodology and integrate each step with technology.\n\nOvercome any aversion to using technology to sell.\n\nAvoid the trap of overuse or dependency on technology.\n\nWhat you'll learn\n\nHow to gain new customers and increase order size through the use of technology\n\nHow to employ cloud applications like SalesForce.com or BatchBook.com to keep track of customers, stay organized, and sell more systematically\n\nHow to use social media to increase sales\n\nHow to maintain the personal element in a world wired with technology\n\nThe best sales methodology and how to integrate each step with technology\n\nHow to avoid the trap of overuse or dependency on technology\n\nWho this book is for\n\nThere are many salespeople in the U.S. According to Selling Power magazine, roughly one in every 14 Americans works in a large sales force. The U.S. government puts the total number of salespeople at around 16 million. This does not include entrepreneurs, who don't usually classify themselves as salespeople but who need to have a strong sales capability. Nor does it include the number of people who use technology to support salespeople.\n\nWhile this book can help all of them, the primary audience is business-to-business salespeople (selling engines to car makers, ERP software to IT departments, office supplies to large companies, etc.). It is just as useful for the many business-to-consumer salespeople selling cars, electronics, insurance, services, and much more. Although the numbers are not as big, the book is crucially important to sales management who stand to benefit from systems that work and training staff on appropriate processes. Finally, the IT department in charge of implementing technology for salespeople can turn to this book in order to customize technology for their company's specific needs.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Sales"]},{"id":"0131453564","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Who Stole My Customer??: Winning Strategies for Creating and Sustaining Customer Loyalty","authors":["Harvey Thompson"],"pages":"224","publication_date":"February 2004","description":"Who's stealing your customers?

Most businesses realize that the dayswhen they relied on three national networks (ABC, NBC,and CBS) and a few national newspapers to advertise aregone; thus, they begin to find alternatives to standardizedadvertising. Many of them begin to adopt moreindividualized advertising approaches, empowered byInternet technologies.This book outlines three fundamental strategies of advertising:standardized, targeted, and individualized. Itdescribes each strategy in detail and discusses the prosand cons of each. The importance of collecting consumerinsights and incorporating those insights into advertisingmessages are also highlighted. Although a few high-technologycompanies, such as Google, Facebook, andAmazon, are showing success in delivering individualizedadvertising messages to consumers, this approach (includingboth personalization and customization) is not suitablefor all businesses. No single strategy is absolutely moreeffective than the others; however, inside you are given areal strategy based on a scrutiny of the value proposition ofthe business and expectations of consumers.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Marketing"]},{"id":"9781590479209","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Combining and Modifying SAS® Data Sets: Examples Second Edition","authors":["Michele M.

It is now a vow many businesses make. However, the correlation between increasing customer satisfaction and increasing customer spending with your company is very weak, according to the authors. Their research finds that changes in customers’ satisfaction levels explain less than 1% of variation in a company’s share of category spending. Is customer satisfaction worth the cost? To find out, the authors investigated the relationship between customer satisfaction and business outcomes, gathering data from more than 100,000 consumers covering more than 300 brands. Although high customer satisfaction ratings are typically treated by managers as being universally good for business, the authors’ findings indicate that the benefits are not nearly so clear-cut. There is a downside to continuously devoting resources to raise customer satisfaction levels. Managers are rarely able to accurately quantify the cost associated with increasing customer satisfaction scores (for example, from 8.7 to 9.1 on a 10-point scale), nor are they able to determine precisely what such an increase is actually worth. It turns out the return on these investments is often trivial or even negative. Knowing a customer’s satisfaction level tells you little about how he or she will divide his or her spending among the different brands used. As a result, changes in customer satisfaction levels are unlikely to have a meaningful impact on the share of category spending customers allocate with your brand. Why? Single-brand loyalty, which was common in our parents’ and grandparents’ generations, has been replaced with loyalty to multiple brands in a category in many sectors. Because of this divided loyalty, more customers partially defect (in other words, they give more of their business to a competitor) than completely defect from a business or brand. As a result, improving customers’ share of spending with your brand tends to represent a far greater opportunity than efforts to improve customer retention. kThe measure that really matters, according to the authors, isn’t your percentage of delighted customers or promoters. What matters is the relative “rank” that your brand’s satisfaction level represents vis-àvis your competitors.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Sales","Customer Service"]},{"id":"9781484262375","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Learn Data Science Using SAS Studio: A Quick-Start Guide","authors":["Engy Fouda"],"pages":"232","publication_date":"October 2020","description":"Do you want to create data analysis reports without writing a line of code?

Suarez"],"pages":"7","publication_date":"January 2015","description":"Category labels are not the same as company brand. Brands create unique relationships between customers and your particular company. Category labels, however, are a way to identify a product’s commonality with others of its type. For example, Tesla Motors markets and maintains its distinctive “Tesla” brand, but the category label the company uses to introduce its products is “electric cars.” Categories, like brands, matter in ways that are subtle and profound.\n\nNew industries are characterized by an early period of confusion and uncertainty about product use and meaning. The industry that we know today as “cloud computing” started decades ago under labels such as “utility computing,” “time sharing,” “application services provider,” and “software as a service.” While the category label “smartphone” is ubiquitous today, in the late 1990s, Samsung once called a product of that type a “camera phone,” others called it a “PDA phone” and Nokia called it a “gaming deck.”\n\nContrary to popular opinion in the business press, the first-mover advantage of entering a new market very early can be a disadvantage. But when should companies launch a product in a nascent industry? In a nascent industry or sector, the introduction of the dominant category label marks the start point of the ideal window of opportunity for entry. Before the introduction of the dominant category label, most consumers are reluctant to commit, which often results in a difficult time period for early-entry producers, who must try to convince customers to try their products. The end point of the ideal window for entry is the introduction of a dominant product design into the market; after that, companies need to conform to customers’ expectations for the product category.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing"]},{"id":"9781612907765","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"SAS Macro Language Magic","authors":["Robert Virgile"],"pages":"162","publication_date":"August 2013","description":"SAS Macro Language Magic: Discovering Advanced Techniques pushes the SAS macro language to the limit.

On space walks and through windows, Garan was struck by the stunning beauty of the Earth from space but sobered by knowing how much needed to be done to help this troubled planet. And yet on the International Space Station, Garan, a former fighter pilot, was working work side by side with Russians, who only a few years before were “the enemy.” If fifteen nationalities could collaborate on one of the most ambitious, technologically complicated undertakings in history, surely we can apply that kind of cooperation and innovation toward creating a better world. That spirit is what Garan calls the “orbital perspective.”Garan vividly conveys what it was like learning to work with a diverse group of people in an environment only a handful of human beings have ever known. But more importantly, he describes how he and others are working to apply the orbital perspective here at home, embracing new partnerships and processes to promote peace and combat hunger, thirst, poverty, and environmental destruction.

People outside your country want your product, and they want it now. The problem is that most small business owners do not know how to service these inquiries. What's the best way to ship goods?

His primary insight is that our sensorium does not, beyond immediate social groups, present smooth, mirror-like vistas of our socially networked world. Contrariwise, he shows that this uniquely human array of channels presents a mosaic of disparate inputs with subtle fissures and sutures between and among them. That more sophisticated view of our sensory apparatus allows him to describe with great practicality, the fissured, segmented architectures we inject into our enterprises and, above all, our markets. These insights particularly illuminate the revolution reshaping our understanding of the basic couplet of value exchange driving markets: Buying and selling. In this revolution a more telling focus on services as catalysts of value exchange is supplanting the traditional terms: goods and product, as the architecture of that very human sensorium broached above modulates value exchange across the chain of institutional need in markets. Armed with this novel set of insights, we come away with a far better sense of what is happening Òoverhead,Ó as we work out our missions and careers amid our socially constructed edifices: enterprises, institutions, and their battlegrounds, our markets.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Marketing"]},{"id":"9781635260595","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Data Management Solutions Using SAS Hash Table Operations","authors":["Paul Dorfman","Don Henderson"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"July 2018","description":"Hash tables can do a lot more than you might think!

This book will guide you on how to differentiate between the two and to think more clearly and correctly when making those decisions, thereby increasing organizational success. The author has based this book on the fields of epistemology—the study of how knowledge is created—and the philosophy of science— the study of what it means for a science to be called a science. The motivation behind the book is quite simple: Given that science is so successful, why shouldn’t marketers borrow thinking and reasoning skills from science and apply them to marketing? Indeed, why not? The book details the groundwork for learning how to apply scientific reasoning to the field of marketing, such as some basic and important definitions (“What is a belief?” “What is knowledge?”), and identifies barriers to scientific reasoning, giving an example from the Dow Chemical Company and just how Dow uses critical thinking and reasoning skills to make more effective marketing and business decisions. You’ll also learn some real “thinking tools” you will need to apply scientific reasoning to solving your marketing problems. It introduces topics relating to attributes versus constructs, the meaning of causation, the relationship between coherence and justified beliefs, the importance of logic to sound reasoning, and the avoidance of logical fallacies in making sound recommendations. The book concludes by giving you direction to further improve your ability to apply scientific reasoning to solving marketing problems.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Marketing"]},{"id":"9780470562260","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Twitter Marketing: An Hour a Day","authors":["Hollis Thomases"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"January 2010","description":"The complete guide to a successful Twitter marketing campaign\n\nTwitter is a microblogging service that's changing the way we communicate.

The authors outline a simple strategic process for making businesses so highly attractive that perfect customers and clients are naturally drawn right to them.\n\nSound too good to be true? Hall and Brogniez have successfully shown clients how to do it for years, and now they share their secrets. They prove that it is no longer productive or profitable to conduct business using the war-like marketing techniques of targeting customers and outmaneuvering the competition. In fact, these techniques seem antiquated and labor-intensive when compared to the Strategic Attraction Planning process, which requires just five minutes each day and enables any business to easily attract customers that are a perfect fit for their organization-the kind of customers it is a pleasure to serve.\n\nAttracting Perfect Customers takes you step by step through the entire strategic attraction process. The authors reveal the six success standards of strategic synchronicity and share simple, fun, and easy-to-follow exercises that can be applied to any organization. They walk you through the process of creating your own personalized Strategic Attraction Plan and provide 21 supportive tips for making any company more attractive to its perfect customers.\n\nAttracting Perfect Customerswill take you to a place where there is an abundance of perfect customers and clients with whom you can build strong, satisfying, profitable, and lasting relationships.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Sales","Customer Success"]},{"id":"9781119762690","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"The Sale","authors":["Jon Gordon","Alex Demczak"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"April 2022","description":"The #1 strategy to build trust and create success\n\nIn The Sale, bestselling author Jon Gordon and rising star Alex Demczak deliver an invaluable lesson about what matters most in life and work and how to achieve it.

Our inboxes are flooded with spam, we have too many “friends” on Facebook, and our Twitter accounts have become downright unmanageable. Creating content is easy; finding what matters is hard.\n\nFortunately, there is a new magic that makes the Web work. It’s called curation, and it enables people to sort through the digital excess and find what’s relevant.\n\nIn Curation Nation, Steven Rosenbaum reveals why brands, publishers, and content entrepreneurs must embrace aggregation and curation to grow an existing business or launch a new one. In fact, he asserts that curation is the only way to be competitive in the future.\n\nOverwhelmed by too much content, people are hungry for an experience that both takes advantage of the Web’s breadth and depth and provides a measure of human sorting and filtering that search engines simply can’t achieve. In these shifting sands lies an extraordinary business opportunity: you can become a trusted source of value in an otherwise meaningless chaos of digital noise.\n\nIn Curation Nation, Rosenbaum “curates the curators” by gathering together priceless insight and advice from the top thinkers in media, advertising, publishing, commerce, and Web technologies. This groundbreaking book levels the playing field, giving your business equal access to the content abundance presently driving consumer adoption of the Web.\n\nAs the sheer volume of digital information in the world increases, the demand for quality and context becomes more urgent. Curation will soon be a part of your business and your digital world.

Both offerings are optimized to help your organization reap the rewards of SAP HANA while also transforming IT service delivery more generally.\n\nDesigned for enterprise-grade operations, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP Applications offers an open-source software-defined infrastructure (SDI) that is optimized for SAP workloads.

Gloor"],"pages":"7","publication_date":"April 2014","description":"Managing employees who work together globally is an ongoing challenge for executives of large organizations. The ability to quickly detect changes in the health of relationships with clients can unlock significant value. Many companies monitor customer satisfaction through customer satisfaction surveys, such as the Net Promoter Score (NPS) pioneered by Bain & Co. However, such methods are limited in their ability to provide frequent, detailed and cost-effective evaluations. The way people interact with each other and what they say offer an important window into how they feel about each other. However, the content of what is said is often less significant than how it is said and the accompanying body language. Although face-to-face meetings between providers and customers may offer the clearest and most comprehensive way for managers to gauge customer satisfaction, such information is not generally available in high-volume, globalized collaborations. The authors have developed an assessment method for analyzing email communication patterns between customers and vendors in geographically distributed environments where face-to-face meetings are impractical or impossible. In conducting the research, the authors analyzed the email interactions of 32 service delivery organizations — all part of Genpact, a large global services provider. After notifying the various parties involved and obtaining permissions, the authors retrieved the communications between account managers and their customers and constructed the social network. The authors collected the email boxes of two to three account executives per customer studied and compared the network structure of the communications to the customer’s NPS, which was the primary customer satisfaction metric Genpact had been using. The authors also collected the email headers from incoming and outgoing emails for the account executives over a period of eight months. The researchers compared the structure of the resulting communication network with the NPS scores. The authors acknowledge that the method is specifically based on email analysis, and thus it is poorly suited to work contexts where email is not widely employed. In the future, they suggest that it might be possible to adapt the methodology to other electronic media, such as instant messaging services and voice-over-IP telephony.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Sales","Customer Service"]},{"id":"53863MIT57203","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"How CEOs Can Leverage Twitter","authors":["Claudia Kubowicz Malhotra","Arvind Malhotra","Gerald C. Kane"],"pages":"7","publication_date":"January 2016","description":"Few CEOs of large companies leverage the power of Twitter to the fullest extent. As of September 2014, only 42 Fortune 500 CEOs had Twitter accounts. The authors argue that rather than waiting for impressions to be driven by the media or by individuals with ulterior motives, CEOs can use Twitter to help shape their public image and that of their companies.\n\nThe authors studied the Twitter activity of 25 CEOs of publicly traded companies who were active on Twitter and identified common patterns and themes. Based on the type of content tweeted most often, the authors classified the CEOs they studied into four groups: Generalists, Expressionists, Information Mavens, and Business Mavens.\n\nGeneralists used Twitter to share a wide range of content. At times they tweeted about personal opinions and interests; other times, they tweeted information closely related to the business (for example, strategy, existing products and services, customer references, etc.). However, on average they had the smallest networks among the groups of CEOs, perhaps because they were not sharing information that was unique.\n\nExpressionists used Twitter extensively for non-business content sharing. These CEOs shared their opinions about events and politics and gave their followers an insight into their daily lives. In many ways, they used Twitter as a brand-building platform for themselves as they do for their companies.\n\nInformation Mavens frequently shared links to information, news, and other happenings. However, they did not generally tweet information specific to their company, acting more like curators of content. As a result, relatively few people retweeted or “favorited” their tweets.\n\nBusiness Mavens used Twitter extensively and primarily shared business-related content. In contrast to the other CEO groups that the authors identified, Business Mavens often shared new product announcements, information about existing products, customer references, and information about management initiatives and strategy. Although they also used Twitter to share content related to personal opinions and interests and links to other interesting information, the majority of their tweets were business-related. As a group, the Business Mavens produced tweets that were retweeted and favorited more often than those of CEOs in the other three groups, and they had significantly larger follower networks.\n\nThe authors’ research suggests that certain types of CEO tweets are more likely to be favorited and retweeted than others: tweets that provide new information about the company’s products and services; tweets that refer to external validation; and tweets that share customer stories and refer to customers.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Marketing","Digital Marketing","Social Media Marketing"]},{"id":"53863MIT62409","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Right Way to Mix and Match Your Customers","authors":["William Schmidt","Nikolay Osadchiy","Jing Wu"],"pages":"5","publication_date":"May 2021","description":"Companies that experience big fluctuations in demand can incur significant costs: overtime and lost sales when demand is too high, and idle capacity and excess inventory when demand slumps.

The popularity of consumer-generated content (CGC) has captured the consumer (i.e., user) as the producer, which has cause a power shift in the market from the companies to the consumers. When technology is paired with culture, it is inevitable that consumers are constantly changing their attitudes toward consumption to adapt to current trends. Thus, marketers are meticulously looking for information to keep current with the consumer market in order to maintain their market share. CGC relates closely to electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) and can be found in various online review sites, forums, blogs, company websites, as well as on social media platforms. Consumers’ contribution toward the content on the different digital media sites (including company’s website) is on voluntary basis, either paid (e.g., sponsored) or nonpaid (e.g., personal blogs). It is evident that information that is published online travels faster to consumers than when delivered through traditional media such as television. Companies are therefore trying to be proactive; and as part of their promotional efforts, they are turning to online media for the latest information on their target market, feedback on their company (e.g., criticism, praises), as well as information on their competitors. The goal of this book is to educate business owners, marketing practitioners, students, as well as marketing researchers in understanding the use of CGC and how it is beneficial for their marketing plan.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Marketing"]},{"id":"9780133100310","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Google+ for Small Businesses","authors":["Lynette Young"],"pages":"88","publication_date":"November 2012","description":"Small business owners: Use Google+ to generate and convert leads, build buzz, and deliver flat-out unbeatable service and support!

For the first time in history, ordinary people around the world have the ability to create, distribute, and consume content instantly, from anywhere, using connected devices. The massive increase in media \"noise\" created by these consumers and devices creates an entirely new situation that makes conventional marketing models obsolete. And yet countless companies and marketing organizations continue to rely on traditional models, assuming that their \"campaigns\" will sway customers. They couldn't be more wrong.\n\nIn this provocative and practical book, Salesforce marketing maven Mathew Sweezey boldly outlines this new \"infinite media\" environment and poses a profound question: In a transformed world where customers shape their own experience, what is the key to breaking through and motivating them to buy? It is context--the close linkage between an individual's immediate desires and the experiences a brand creates to fulfill them. Drawing on new research and new insights into current consumer psychology, Sweezey defines the five key elements of context. Customer experiences must be:\n\nAvailable: Helping people achieve the value they seek in the moment\nPermissioned: Giving people what they've asked for, on their terms\nPersonal: Going beyond how personal it is to how personally you can deliver it\nAuthentic: Combining voice, empathy, and brand congruence simultaneously\nPurposeful: Creating a deeper connection to the brand, beyond the product\n\nSweezey uses vivid examples to highlight a new marketing model used by high-performing brands big and small. The final part of the book shifts to execution, providing a new rule book for context-based marketing.\n\nThe Context Marketing Revolution will change forever how you think about the purpose and practice of marketing.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing"]},{"id":"9781422195161","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Work Smarter with Social Media","authors":["Alexandra Samuel"],"pages":"300","publication_date":"May 2015","description":"Build your social media strategy.\n\nFrom managing email to building a social media presence, making smart use of technology is essential to professional success in a digital world.

Based on 21 case studies and 126 reviews of manufacturers’ sales and marketing practices, this book explains the common pitfalls so many companies experience, and it offers common sense, practicable, and affordable step-by-step “how to’s” for cost and profitability analyses on products and customers.

Upton"],"pages":"8","publication_date":"January 2016","description":"When Martha Payne, a 9-year-old student in Argyll, Scotland, started a blog in April 2012 to photograph and rate her school lunches, she had no idea of the stir she would cause. The blog logged 2 million hits in its first six weeks. When the local area council asked her to stop, an online firestorm ensued and the council reversed its decision. It’s a familiar story — every day, images or events with the potential to incite passions get captured digitally, posted to the Web, and “go viral.” With social media, people share their experiences with friends or followers, who share with more people. Seemingly insignificant occurrences can strike a nerve with a nascent virtual community, and unsuspecting parties must respond to a dicey new problem.\n\nThe capacity to generate causes and controversies almost instantly may be the most salient aspect of what authors Robert D. Austin and David M. Upton call the “super-transparent society.”\n\nHistorically, the authors explain, people in a particular community were the only ones who paid attention to the local goings-on. When information moved outside of that environment, it was due to deliberate action: some identifiable person or organization moving it. If you wanted to guard information, you built a barrier. Many things have changed, particularly the volume of information.\n\nThe article suggests several steps that can help managers meet the new expectations for transparency, including the following:\n\nExamine your assumptions about how you can keep information contained.\n\nReview your strategy for dealing with vulnerability to unintended transparency.\n\nReview operations for issues that might be problematic if revealed.\n\nAssume that others will put out information about your organization for their own reasons and that you won’t be able to prevent it.\n\nRecognize that new information flows change what people consider to be fair.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Marketing","Content Marketing"]},{"id":"9781633691421","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Do You Want to Keep Your Customers Forever?","authors":["Joseph B.

This book introduces the rising trend of SoLoMo consumers who embrace an omnichannel marketing approach. Consumers are rapidly moving between channels and platforms, which is why marketers are finding it so difficult to implement an integrated marketing strategy. Today’s consumers can check into a store with the use of a geolocation service (Foursquare), redeem an offer that is available, and share their comment on that platform. Then immediately they can post an update on their Facebook timeline, referencing the retailer’s page. SoLoMo consumers have three basic characteristics: SOcial media engagement, LOcal findability, and smartphone MObility. The authors conceptualize this new marketing approach, and provide examples to illustrate the case. The SoLoMo phenomenon has completely changed the way marketers need to operate their campaigns, from the way they conceive of their relationship with the customer to the way they design and operate campaigns.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Marketing","Digital Marketing"]},{"id":"9781951527655","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Innovative Selling","authors":["Eden White"],"pages":"232","publication_date":"May 2020","description":"Innovative Selling is a unique book for corporate sales professionals and their sales leaders about how to prepare, manage, cope, and succeed at corporate global sales.\n\nRecent research has discovered concerning underlying discontent with professional sales people who represent global sales organizations.

Foreseeing a changing environment, many sales organizations have begun to focus on technology-related strategies, business processes, and applications to adapt to these emerging issues. With this in mind, sales force technology usage has changed the methods of selling. Salespeople are no longer selling just a \"product\"; instead, they are providing a valuable \"solution\" to customer problems. Salespeople now act as consultants or experts and provide customized solutions. This role requires salespeople to develop a technological orientation to access, analyze, and communicate information in order to establish a strong relationship with customers. Sales technology enables salespeople to answer the queries of customers and effectively provide competent solutions. The ability to answer queries and provide solutions leads to strong relationships between a salesperson and a customer. Thus, technology tools are not only used for smoothing the work process, but also have strategic utilizations. With the adoption of technological tools at exponential rates, many firms fell into pitfalls and witnessed failure of their technology initiatives. The purpose of this book is to outline the important steps that must be considered and adhered to when implementing sales force technology. Perhaps the most important aspect covered within this book is that technology usage is both a strategy and a tool; therefore, we outline both strategic considerations as well as implementation procedures throughout each chapter. It is important to consider all the steps and the necessary actions that will need to take place before the first penny is spent; then and only then will the technology have its intended effect.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Sales"]},{"id":"9780135228722","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"My Facebook for Seniors, Fourth Edition","authors":["Michael Miller"],"pages":"336","publication_date":"August 2018","description":"Easy, clear, readable, and focused on what you want to do.\n\n \n\nStep-by-step instructions for the tasks you care about most\n\nLarge, full-color, close-up photos show you exactly what to do\n\nCommon-sense help whenever you run into problems using the Facebook app and website\n\nTips and notes to help you connect with family and friends\n\n \n\nThe full-color, step-by-step tasks–in legible print–walk you through sharing posts, photos, and videos on Facebook.\n\n \n\nWhether you are new to Facebook or would like to explore more of its features, My Facebook for Seniors makes learning to use the world's most popular social media site simple and fun.

Companies such as Geico, Dell and eBay are adapting the traditional “one-way” advertising message and using it as a stepping-stone to begin a two-way dialogue with consumers via social media.\n\nMarketers know that theoretically, social media should be a powerful way to generate sustainable, positive word-of-mouth marketing. If marketers can only select the right social media platform, design the right message and engage the right users to spread that message, their campaign should be a success. But until now, that’s been a big if.\n\nThe authors propose a seven-step framework for success in social media marketing campaigns. Their framework involves identifying social media users who are not only influential but also particularly interested in the company’s product or service category and then recruiting and incentivizing those influencers to talk about the company’s product or service. The authors describe the implementation of their seven-step framework at Hokey Pokey Ice Cream Creations, an upscale ice-cream retailer with more than a dozen outlets across India. Hokey Pokey’s social media campaign resulted in substantial increases in brand awareness, social media ROI and sales revenue growth rate for the company. The authors also explain three new metrics they developed for use in social media marketing campaigns: the Customer Influence Effect, which measures the influence a social media user has on other users in the network; the Stickiness Index, which helps identify social media users who actively discuss the company’s product or service category; and Customer Influence Value, which helps measure the monetary gain or loss realized by a company in social marketing campaigns by accounting for an individual’s influence on purchases by other customers and prospects.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Marketing","Digital Marketing","Social Media Marketing"]},{"id":"9781292360881","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Key Marketing Metrics, 3rd Edition","authors":["Neil Bendle","Paul Farris","Phillip Pfeifer"],"pages":"491","publication_date":"February 2021","description":"Measure, manage and get the most out of your marketing.\n\nKey Marketing Metrics is the definitive guide to today's most valuable marketing metrics.

However, marketing benefits from an extremely powerful position to encourage transformations at the production level and to guide consumers towards responsible behaviors. From its inception, marketing has been positioned as a support for the relationship between the company and its customers, with the quest for well-being set in the very foundations of the discipline. In a context that is marked by crises and much skepticism, marketing today should, more than ever, prove that it acts in good faith. This book offers practitioners, public authorities, professors and students illustrations that demonstrate that the dissemination of sustainable practices is indeed a marketing issue.

Research shows that totally satisfying the customer is the only thing that will secure loyalty and offer significant competitive advantage. Yet still, on a daily basis we encounter service that frustrates us.\n\nWhilst the emergence of technology has no doubt brought efficiency to many areas of business activity, including the third sector, it has led to the standardised and indifferent service we regularly receive. We appear to have lost sight that people do business with people. Through efficient technology, our organisations may be serviceable but they are not service able.\n\nThe arrival of Generation Y and the developments in social media, provide businesses with a whole new way to engage with their customers, but also provide a new way for customers to rate companies, products and services: not always in a positive manner. 'Like' or '#Fail' have become part of our social language.\n\nOrganizations that refocus on the need to treat customers in a way that satisfies them, and not the technology, will have better customer retention, lower costs of replacement and will build their brand value through better reputations.\n\nService-Ability delves deeply into these areas to show how today's managers need to re-think the way we structure, manage, lead and organize our companies to achieve total 'customer-centric' work cultures that develop lasting relationships with customers.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Sales","Customer Service"]},{"id":"9781599944272","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Carpenter's Complete Guide to the SAS REPORT Procedure","authors":["Art Carpenter"],"pages":"490","publication_date":"February 2013","description":"Art Carpenter demystifies the powerful REPORT procedure and shows you how to incorporate this highly flexible and customizable procedure into your SAS reporting programs.

Although we now have ample insight into how customers evaluate new products, many companies focus primarily on creating value -- without enough regard to how customers recognize innovations and evaluate new products.\n\nThere are only two ways consumers can collect information, the author notes: They can search, or they can infer. Knowing when consumers will search or infer will help you determine which of your innovations customers will recognize.\n\nThe Internet has had a profound impact on the way customers evaluate many products. First, it has lowered the cost of search by making information more accessible. Second, the Internet has broadened what is searchable by including customer reviews as well as product features on standard spec sheets.\n\nTo ensure that customers will recognize the value your products offer, the author recommends focusing on three questions: Are customers motivated to search? Are they able to search effectively?

Cochran","Anne T. Coughlan","Victoria L. Crittenden"],"pages":"174","publication_date":"September 2021","description":"The Power of Direct Selling.\n\nDirect selling is not an industry per se nor is it merely a go-to-market business model and channel to reach consumers. It is bigger than any of this – direct selling is people. The ability for people with entrepreneurial spirit to build a successful business, whether it be from the ground up or by representing a company’s product, is at the heart of direct selling and it is people who made (and continue to make) direct selling the successful marketplace that it is today. The direct selling marketplace is comprised of mission-driven and socially responsible companies offering a wide variety of product and services, and the list of direct selling companies is abundant with entrepreneurs who built their businesses by utilizing an independent salesforce channel to market and sell their products or services directly to consumers.\n\nPossibly one of the most prominent of these entrepreneurs is Mary Kay Ash, a legend as a glass-ceiling breaker and a woman who built a very successful business with a go-to-market strategy of direct selling. Unlike Mary Kay Ash, however, not all aspiring business owners are willing/able to invest their savings and time on a start-up business. These micro-entrepreneurs desire to have the economic and social benefits of managing their own businesses but do not want the startup costs and demands associated with traditional business planning. As such, becoming a direct selling distributor offers a low-risk, low-cost pathway to micro-entrepreneurship.\n\nThe traditional barriers to small business ownership are removed when a micro-entrepreneur builds a direct selling business that is backed by established brands. These established brands, several of which are featured in this book, offer the micro-entrepreneurs quality products, business training, and technological resources to achieve a self-determined metric of success.\n\nFramed within the context of entrepreneurship and an historical overview of the long-term sustainability of this business model, this book is intended for practitioners who want to read about the breadth and depth of direct selling. Importantly, this book provides considerable depth in terms of three particular issues associated with direct selling:\n\nCompensation,\nEthics & compliance, and\nGlobal reach.\n\nFor scholars, this book is built on a strong foundation of valid and reliable research endeavors. The authors have published research on direct selling in high quality, reputable and peer-reviewed academic and practitioner journals. Thus, this book can add foundationally to the research efforts of academics who are conducting research in a wide variety of topics (such as sales, women empowerment, business strategy, ethics, distribution models, gig economy, and global entry – to name a few), as well as to members of the press who want reliable and valid content upon which to build their stories.\n\nThe book’s content is also particularly informative for policymakers at the local, state, national, and international levels. For students, reading this book will offer a variety of insights, particularly related to the intricacies of channel selection and design. Direct Selling: A Global and Social Business Model is a collective project from eight academics and practitioners who have dedicated much of their careers to understanding direct selling as both a go-to-market strategy and a channel of distribution and to capturing the people who are the foundation of direct selling. The pages of this book bring together a wealth of research and knowledge that can inform a broad spectrum of constituents about the economic and social benefits of direct selling, while also providing detail and clarity on key issues related to direct selling as a sustainable business model.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Marketing"]},{"id":"9780814432808","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Delight Your Customers","authors":["Steve Curtin"],"pages":"208","publication_date":"June 2013","description":"Great customer service is rare. In fact, one survey found that while 80 percent of companies described themselves as delivering “superior” service, consumers estimated the number at a mere 8 percent. The problem, according to service expert Steve Curtin, is actually quite simple. When asked what their work entails, most employees list the duties and tasks associated with their position. Very few refer to the true essence of their job, which should be their highest priority—to create delighted customers who will be less price sensitive, have higher repurchase rates, and enthusiastically recommend the company or brand to others. Without this customer focus, all that exists is a transaction—and transactional service does not make a lasting positive impression or inspire loyalty. In Delight Your Customers, Curtin reveals three elements common to all exceptional service experiences. He also makes a compelling case that attention needs to shift from monitoring service activities to modeling, recognizing, and reinforcing the behaviors that actually create happy customers, such as expressing genuine interest, offering sincere compliments, sharing unique knowledge, conveying authentic enthusiasm, providing pleasant surprises, and delivering service heroics when needed. Illustrated with real-world stories and examples, this refreshing guide helps readers everywhere take their customer service from ordinary to extraordinary.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Sales","Customer Service"]},{"id":"9781398603622","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Influencing Shopper Decisions","authors":["Rebecca Brooks","Devora Rogers"],"pages":"208","publication_date":"April 2022","description":"Attract and engage the attention of today's fickle consumer by understanding the shopper brain and adapting your strategies to focus on consumer needs, priorities and context.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Sales","Customer Success"]},{"id":"9780749443368","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Researching Customer Satisfaction and Loyalty","authors":["Paul Szwarc"],"pages":"272","publication_date":"July 2005","description":"This practical guide examines how to research customer satisfaction and loyalty from both a client and supplier perspective, and how to get the best results from such research.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Sales","Customer Success"]},{"id":"9780132546126","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"To Tweet or Not to Tweet: Writing Effective Text Messages for Business","authors":["Natalie Canavor","Claire Meirowitz"],"pages":"6","publication_date":"March 2010","description":"This Element is an excerpt from The Truth About the New Rules of Business Writing (9780137153152) by Natalie Canavor and Claire Meirowitz.
