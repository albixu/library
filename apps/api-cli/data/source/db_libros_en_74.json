Gisi"],"pages":"428","publication_date":"May 2018","description":"This book presents a methodology for continuous process improvement in a structured, logical, and easily understandable framework based on industry accepted tools, techniques and practices. It starts by highlighting and explaining the conditions necessary for establishing a stable and capable process and the actions required to maintain process control, while setting the stage for sustainable efficiency improvements driven by waste elimination and process flow enhancement.\n\nThis structured approach makes a clear connection between the need for a quality process to serve as the foundation for incremental efficiency improvements. The expectation of this work is to move beyond talking about the value contribution of tools and techniques for process control and continuous improvement by focus on the daily work routines necessary to maintain and sustain these activities as part of a process or 'shop floor' management mindset.\n\nPart 1 starts the discussion of continuous process improvement with an understanding of variation and its impact on process. It continues by stressing the importance of standardizing a process on the road to process stability. Once process stability is reflected in a consistent and predictable process output, attention is turned to ensuring output capability consistently meets customer requirements. This series of activities sets the foundation for the sustainable pursuit of efficiency improvements.\n\nPart 2 focuses on efficiency improvement by eliminating waste while improving process flow using proven tools, techniques and methods. Although there is a clear relationship between waste elimination and process flow, these activities are discussed separately to allow those more interested in waste elimination to work independently from those looking to optimize value stream flow.\n\nPart 3, the final section, explores the principles, practices, systems and behaviors required to maintain process control while creating a mindset of continuous incremental improvement. This section also considers the role organizational structure, discipline and accountability play as essential components for long term operational success.\n\nThe key benefits of this work is to provide readers with a clear roadmap to establishing, achieving and maintaining process control as the foundation upon which to pursue efficiency improvements. It will raise awareness of the practices, systems and behaviors required to realize desired results and sustain a culture of process control and continuous improvement along the road to operational excellence.","tags":["Business","Operations","Process Management"]},{"id":"9789361599941","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Advertising, Brand and Consumer Behaviour (The Indian Context), Ist Edition by Pearson","authors":["Ramesh Kumar","Anup Krishnamurhty"],"pages":"288","publication_date":"May 2024","description":"There have been a number of books published on consumer behaviour and advertising.

The explosive growth of the \"leadership industry\" is based on the belief that leading is a path to power and money, a medium for achievement, and a mechanism for creating change. But there are other, parallel truths: that leaders of every stripe are in disrepute; that the tireless and often superficial teaching of leadership has brought us no closer to nirvana; and that followers nearly everywhere have become, on the one hand, disappointed and disillusioned, and, on the other, entitled and emboldened.\n\nThe End of Leadership tells two tales. The first is about change—about how and why leadership and followership have changed over time, especially in the last forty years. As a result of cultural evolution and technological revolution, the balance of power between leaders and followers has shifted—with leaders becoming weaker and followers stronger.\n\nThe second narrative is about the leadership industry itself. In this provocative and critical volume, Barbara Kellerman raises questions about leadership as both a scholarly pursuit and a set of practical skills: Does the industry do what it claims to do—grow leaders? Does the research justify the undertaking? Do we adequately measure the results of our efforts? Are leaders as all-important as we think they are? What about followers? Isn't teaching good followership as important now as teaching good leadership? Finally, Kellerman asks: Given the precipitous decline of leaders in the estimation of their followers, are there alternatives to the existing models—ways of teaching leadership that take into account the vicissitudes of the twenty-first century?\n\nThe End of Leadership takes on all these questions and then some—making it necessary reading for business, political, and community leaders alike.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781119719090","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Negotiate Without Fear","authors":["Victoria Medvec"],"pages":"256","publication_date":"July 2021","description":"The tools you need to maximize success in any negotiation, at any level\n\nWith Negotiate Without Fear: Strategies and Tools to Maximize Your Outcomes, master negotiator, Kellogg professor, and accomplished CEO Victoria Medvec delivers an authoritative and practical resource for eliminating the fear that impedes success in negotiation.

Customers, employees, and investors are making it clear that they want companies to do more than provide good products, good prospects, and good profits—they want companies to do some social good too. Ironically, as this extremely timely book demonstrates, purpose-driven companies do better on nearly every traditional metric: greater customer loyalty, higher retention, more innovation, and a healthier bottom line. But how do you become a purpose-driven company? Just crafting an inspiring new mission statement and starting a CSR program won't cut it, says John Izzo, who predicted the purpose revolution in his 1994 book Awakening Corporate Soul. Purpose must pervade every part of your organization. In this thoroughly researched hands-on guide, Izzo and Jeff Vanderwielen provide a tool kit for deeply embedding purpose into your leadership and organizational culture.Using scores of real-world examples and practical exercises, Izzo and Vanderwielen help leaders find a truly authentic purpose, one that is a natural fit for them and their organization. They describe concrete actions leaders can take to ensure that employees own it, customers and recruits connect with it, and every corporate action and activity reflects it. They show leaders how to avoid common pitfalls on the path to purpose and how to use purpose to guide all their decision making. In an increasingly crowded economic landscape, purpose gives you a powerful competitive advantage. But it does more than that.

Maybe it’s in your workplace, or in your relationships, or simply in your own life.  But great leadership—leadership that aligns teams, inspires action, and achieves results—is hard. And what makes it hard isn’t theoretical, it’s practical. It’s not about knowing what to say or do.

Advanced consulting requires both expertise and personal qualifications that are distinct from those needed in everyday consulting. Advanced consultants work with high-level executive teams on complex issues such as strategy, organizational design, merger integration, digital disruption, culture change, and system-wide transformation. While neophyte consultants are often given a playbook to follow, advanced consultants need to invent methods that take full advantage of the opportunities that their work with clients presents. There is an art to advanced consulting as well as a science; who you are is as important as what you do. Bill Pasmore draws on his four decades of experience as a consultant and teacher of consultants to show readers how to see possibilities that are not evident, conduct analyses that support the value of more comprehensive work, build relationships that engender deeper trust, adapt to changing circumstances, and empower members of their team to take independent actions while maintaining overall control of an engagement.

Kaplan"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"July 2016","description":"The future of management is here!\n\nTraditional management was invented for very different times and is today in serious trouble. The level of volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity in business environments is record high. People’s expectations towards their employers and leaders have also radically changed. A number of organizations are exploring management innovation that can help them not just coping but thriving and out-performing in these new and different realities. Beyond Budgeting may be the most important new idea out there addressing these radical changes, due to its broad scope and coherent approach. Abolishing the traditional, detailed annual budget is necessary, but not sufficient. Organizations on the journey are questioning their old leadership beliefs and are tearing up their old command-and-control management models, with “agile” and “human” as the foundation for a new start.\n\nImplementing Beyond Budgeting is both a theoretical introduction and a practical guide to bringing such a more empowered and adaptive management model to life. Drawing on the author’s twenty years of Beyond Budgeting experience, this book not only demonstrates the serious problems with traditional management through numerous practical examples. It also follows several companies on their Beyond Budgeting journey, including Scandinavia’s largest company Statoil where the author has been heading up implementation since 2005. You'll get a first-hand glimpse at the reality of transitioning a large multinational company, and gain a real-world perspective on what successful implementation entails.\n\nThis new second edition has been significantly revised and expanded. It covers the amazing development of the Beyond Budgeting movement and how the Statoil implementation journey has continued since the first edition of this book was published in 2009, sustaining major events like for instance the 2015 oil price crash. A new chapter on “Beyond Budgeting and Agile” has also been added. New implementation experiences, great new case stories, new management innovation examples and management metaphors (traffic controls!) are introduced, as well as the author’s latest reflections on a range of management issues including target setting, forecasting, performance evaluation and incentives.","tags":["Business","Project & Product Management","Project Management"]},{"id":"9781118496404","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Market Your Way to Growth: 8 Ways to Win","authors":["Philip Kotler","Milton Kotler"],"pages":"212","publication_date":"December 2012","description":"Marketing guru Philip Kotler and global marketing strategist Milton Kotler show you how to survive rough economic waters\n\nWith the developed world facing slow economic growth, successfully competing for a limited customer base means using creative and strategic marketing strategies.

It's always about intentional business change, or what's the point?It's time to stop providing simplistic, one-dimensional, all-you-gotta-do panaceas.

Now Mark brings his unique perspective and experience to business leaders looking to lead their company into the digital age by harnessing the expertise and innovation that is already under their roof: IT. In the war for business supremacy, Schwartz shows we must throw out the old management models and stereotypes that pit suits against nerds. Instead, business leaders of today can foster a space of collaboration and shared mission, a space that puts technologists and business people on the same team. For business leaders looking to unlock their enterprise's digital transformation, War and Peace and IT provides clear context and strategies. Schwartz demystifies the role IT plays in the modern enterprise, allowing business leaders to create new strategies for the new digital battleground. It is time to change not only the enterprise's relationship with technology, but its relationship with technologists. To accelerate, enterprises must bring technology to the heart of their work, for just as technology is causing this disruption, it is technology that provides the solution. Unlike Napoleon, it is time for business leaders to come down from the hill atop the Battle of Borodino and enter the fray with the technologists, for that is where the war will be won or lost.","tags":["Business","Economics","Next Economy"]},{"id":"9781633696334","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Why Do So Many Incompetent Men Become Leaders?","authors":["Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic"],"pages":"240","publication_date":"February 2019","description":"Look around your office. Turn on the TV. Incompetent leadership is everywhere, and there's no denying that most of these leaders are men.\n\nIn this timely and provocative book, Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic asks two powerful questions: Why is it so easy for incompetent men to become leaders? And why is it so hard for competent people--especially competent women--to advance?\n\nMarshaling decades of rigorous research, Chamorro-Premuzic points out that although men make up a majority of leaders, they underperform when compared with female leaders. In fact, most organizations equate leadership potential with a handful of destructive personality traits, like overconfidence and narcissism. In other words, these traits may help someone get selected for a leadership role, but they backfire once the person has the job.\n\nWhen competent women--and men who don't fit the stereotype--are unfairly overlooked, we all suffer the consequences. The result is a deeply flawed system that rewards arrogance rather than humility, and loudness rather than wisdom.\n\nThere is a better way. With clarity and verve, Chamorro-Premuzic shows us what it really takes to lead and how new systems and processes can help us put the right people in charge.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"0642572069544","language":"en","level":"Intermediate","title":"Unit Economics","authors":["Dieter Matzion"],"publication_date":"January 2025","description":"FinOps is an essential practice for any company managing workloads in the cloud.

Through compelling research and company examples, including DaimlerChrysler, McKinsey & Company, Shell, and the World Bank, authors Etienne Wenger, Richard McDermott, and William M.

Employee engagement and loyalty expert Heather Younger outlines nine ways to manifest the radical power of caring support in the workplace.Heather Younger argues that if you are looking for increased productivity, customer satisfaction, or employee engagement, you need to care for your employees first. People will go the extra mile for leaders who show they are genuinely concerned not just with what employees can do but with who they are and can become. But while most leaders think of themselves as caring leaders, not all demonstrate that care in consistent ways. Your employees will judge you by your actions, not your intentions. Based on Younger's interviews with over eighty leaders for her podcast Leadership with Heart—including Howard Behar, former president of the Starbucks Coffee Company; Judith Scimone, senior vice president and chief talent officer at MetLife; Garry Ridge, CEO and chairman of the board of the WD-40 Company; and Shawnté Cox Holland, head of culture and engagement at Vanguard—this book outlines nine ways that leaders can make all employees feel included and cared for. She even provides access to a self-assessment so you can measure your progress as a caring leader. But this is not a cookie-cutter approach: just as Monet and Picasso expressed themselves very differently, each leader should express caring in his or her own unique, personal style. Younger takes an often nebulous, subjective concept and makes it concrete and actionable. Leaders have the power to change the lives of those they lead. They shouldn't just want to care, they should see caring as imperative for the success of their employees and their organization.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9798868800146","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Understanding Microsoft Teams Administration: Configure, Customize, and Manage the Teams Experience","authors":["Balu N Ilag","Durgesh Tripathy","Vijay Ireddy"],"pages":"913","publication_date":"December 2023","description":"This book provides solutions, best practices, tips, and workarounds to plan, design, customize, implement, and manage Microsoft Teams in any environment.

Today's development organizations need to extend RUP to cover the entire IT lifecycle, including the cross-project and enterprise issues it largely ignores. The Enterprise Unified Process (EUP) does precisely that, enabling you to deliver systems that meet all the needs of today's businesses. Now, EUP's creator and architects present the definitive introduction to EUP, and demonstrate how to use it in your environment.\n\nThe Enterprise Unified Process systematically identifies the business and technical problems that RUP fails to address, and shows how EUP fills those gaps.

A small group of wealthy investors including Russian oligarchs, English racehorse owners and a former billionaire gold miner have seized the opportunity to enter this booming market.\n\nSome have moved in on the territory of banks and lent money to clubs in exchange for a share in fees generated by Cristiano Ronaldo, Neymar and dozens more of today's stars. Others have acquired obscure teams to get a piece of the pie.\n\nEven as the global financial crisis sent fortunes tumbling this select group found a profitable place to park their money. The size of the transfer market has continued to rise –- it increased seven-fold in value the last two decades, more than the FTSE share index.\n\nBetween them, these wealthy investors have amassed hundreds of millions of euros in profits.

In particular over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives were blamed by many for partially causing and catalysing the crisis. Not surprisingly, this has led to dramatic action from politicians, policymakers and regulators in relation to OTC derivative markets. Two of the most important changes are the mandatory clearing of standardised OTC derivatives and the requirements for bilateral margin posting in non-standard OTC contracts. Both clearing and margining mandates will be effectively phased in from 2014 and the associated costs will be severe. These regulatory changes are therefore going to create a dramatic shift in the topology of financial markets, together with a significant reallocation of counterparty and systemic risks. Knowledge of the subject is an important consideration for all financial institutions whether they are CCP members, clear trades indirectly or find themselves subject to bilateral margin requirements.\n\nCentral Counterparties: Mandatory Clearing and Bilateral Margin Requirements for OTC Derivatives explains the central clearing of OTC derivatives and the associated bilateral margin requirements. The book provides a historical perspective of central clearing as it developed with derivative exchanges in order to mitigate counterparty credit risk. The regulatory requirements (Dodd-Frank, EMIR, Basel III) being imposed since the global financial crisis are defined and discussed. The mechanics of central clearing are described including operational aspects, initial margin and default fund calculations, loss waterfalls and allocation methods. Client clearing is discussed, in particular giving detail on margin segregation and portability methods. An assessment is made throughout of the advantages and disadvantages of clearing and margining requirements, including potential issues such as funding liquidity risk, operational risk and wrong-way risk.\n\nThe book is unique and covers the regulatory requirements together with the practical implementation details and the potential impacts and consequences. It is an invaluable and complete reference guide for any market practitioner, policy maker, academic or student with responsibility or interest in the area of OTC derivatives.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance"]},{"id":"9781118138502","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Private Equity, 2nd Edition","authors":["Harry Cendrowski","Louis W.

Employees today are highly trained and independent-they can offer much more to an enterprise than simply their obedience. And with the relationship between worker and organization constantly changing, no one person will likely be able to lead alone. Creating Leaderful Organizations presents a paradigm of leadership tailored to our times, one that is based on mutual-rather than heroic-leadership.It is not merely consultative, with leaders graciously allowing followers to participate in leadership, nor is it a stewardship approach in which the leader occasionally steps aside to allow others to take over temporarily. It is a revolutionary new approach that transforms leadership from an individual property to a collective responsibility. Raelin details how \"leaderful\" practice can accomplish the critical processes of leadership more effectively than any existing approach. And using actual examples from leading-edge organizations, he offers practical guidance for assessing your own and others' leaderful predisposition, preparing for leaderful practice, distributing leadership roles, and dealing with resistance to change.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781000196146","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Developing Capacity for Innovation in Complex Systems","authors":["Christer Vindeløv-Lidzélius"],"pages":"234","publication_date":"September 2020","description":"Based on a theoretical analysis and supported by both explorative qualitative and quantitative research, this book examines the many reasons why an initiative becomes an innovation and why some organizations are better at innovation than others.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Innovation"]},{"id":"9780071825795","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Sponsorship Seeker's Toolkit, Fourth Edition, 4th Edition","authors":["Kim Skildum-Reid","Anne-Marie Grey"],"pages":"256","publication_date":"April 2014","description":"THE \"BIBLE OF SPONSORSHIP\"--UPDATED WITH NEW SOCIAL MEDIA AND OTHER DIGITAL STRATEGIES\n\nThe Sponsorship Seeker's Toolkit, fourth edition, makes cutting-edge, best-practice sponsorship not only achievable, but sensible and straightforward.

Thomas"],"pages":"308","publication_date":"March 2013","description":"Compensation fairness is a universal preoccupation in today's workplace, from whispers around the water cooler to kabuki in the C-suite. Gender discrimination takes center stage in discussions of internal pay equity, but many other protected characteristics may be invoked as grounds for alleging discrimination: age, race, disability, physical appearance, and more. This broad range of vulnerability to discrimination charges is often neglected in corporate assessments of how well compensation systems comply with the law and satisfy employee norms of fairness. Blind spots in general equity constitute a serious threat to organizational performance and risk management. In Compensating Your Employees Fairly, a respected practitioner and consultant lays out in practical terms everything you need to know to protect your company along the full spectrum of internal pay equity issues, including all the technical methods you need to optimize compliance and minimize risk.\n\nCompensating Your Employees Fairly is a timely survey and comprehensive handbook for compensation specialists, HR professionals, EEO compliance officers, and in-house counsel. It provides all the information you need to ensure that compensation systems are equitable, auditable, internally consistent, and externally compliant with equal employment opportunity laws and regulations. The author presents technical information—both legal and statistical—in common-sense terms. Her non-technical breakdown of complex statistical concepts distills just as much as practitioners need to know in order to effectively deploy and interpret the standard applications of statistical analysis to internal pay equity. The focus throughout the book is on real-world application, current examples, and up-to-the-minute information on recent and pending wrinkles in the evolving legal landscape.\n\nReaders of Compensating Your Employees Fairly will learn:\n\nWhy internal equity in compensation matters\n\nHow to detect intentional and non-intentional discrimination in compensation\n\nThe basics of statistical inference and multiple regression analysis\n\nThe essentials of data availability, measurability, and collection\n\nThe criteria for assessing compensation systems for internal equity\n\nHow to investigate potential problems and react to formal complaints and actions\n\nHow to avoid litigation and put in place ongoing measures for proactive self-auditing\n\nWhat you'll learn\n\nReaders of Compensating Your Employees Fairly will learn:\n\nWhy internal equity in compensation matters\n\nHow to detect intentional and non-intentional discrimination in compensation\n\nHow to investigate potential problems and react to formal complaints and actions\n\nHow to avoid litigation and put in place ongoing measures for proactive self-auditing\n\nWho this book is for\n\nHR professionals, compensation specialists, EEO compliance officers, in-house counsel, and employment attorneys will find invaluable the expert author's non-technical treatment of the technical issues that are essential to understanding all facets of internal pay equity.

They expand the scope of the typical bank management course by addressing all types of deposit-type financial institutions and by explaining the why of intermediation rather than simply describing institutions, regulations, and market phenomena. This analytic approach strikes at the heart of financial intermediation by explaining why financial intermediaries exist and what they do. Specific regulations, economies, and policies will change, but the underlying philosophical foundations remain the same. This approach enables students to understand the foundational principles and to apply them to whatever context they encounter as professionals.\"This book is the perfect liasion between the microeconomics realm of information economics and the real world of banking and financial intermediation. It supplies a healthy dose of microeconomic theory to fully understand the underlying features of the most common financial instruments used in modern banking practice, all explained thoroughly with down to earth narratives and doable math/game theoretic instruments.

Have your palms ever sweated when the decision maker shuts you down with: “I wouldn’t be interested”? Has your heart taken a fast dive into your stomach when, at the start of your presentation, your prospect tells you that they’ve thought about it and are just going to pass?\n\nIf you’re in sales, then the question isn’t “Have you ever felt this way?”, but rather, “How often do you feel this way? Are you finally ready to learn how to confidently and effectively overcome these objections, stalls, and blow-offs? If so, Power Phone Scripts was written for you! Unlike other books on sales that tell you what you should do (like build value – hard to do when the prospect is hanging up on you!), Power Phone Scripts provides word-for-word scripts, phrases, questions, and comebacks that you can use on your very next call. Learn to overcome resistance, get through to the decision maker, and then, once you have him or her on the phone, make an instant connection and earn the right to have a meaningful conversation. You’ll be equipped with proven questions, conversation starters, and techniques to learn whether or not they are even right for your product or service, and, if they aren’t, who else in their company or another department might be.\n\nPower Phone Scripts is the sales manual you’ve been looking for: over 500 proven, current, and non-salesy phrases, rebuttals, questions, and conversation openers that will instantly make you sound more confident – just like the top producing sales pros do right now. Gone will be your call reluctance; gone will be your fear of calling prospects back for presentations and demos; gone will be the fear of asking for the sale at the end of your pitch! This practical guide is filled with effective scripts for prospecting, emailing, voice mails, closes, and tons of rebuttals to recurring objections you get like:\n\n“It costs too much”\n“We already have a vendor for that”\n“I’m going to need to think about it”\n“I need to talk to the boss or committee” and so many others…\n\nMore than just phone scripts, this book provides practical, comprehensive guidance that every inside sales rep needs. Conquer concerns, provide answers, motivate action, and be the conduit between your prospect’s problems and your solution. Actionable, fun, and designed to work within the current sales environment, this invaluable guide is your ticket to the top of the leader board. With Power Phone Scripts, you will never be at a loss of what to say to a prospect or client.\n\nCommunication is everything in sales, and being on top of your game is no longer enough when top producers are playing a different game altogether. You cannot achieve winning stats if you're not even on the field. If you're ready to join the big league, Power Phone Scripts is the playbook you need to win at inside sales.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Sales","Sales Pitch"]},{"id":"9780470933114","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Engaged Leadership: Building a Culture to Overcome Employee Disengagement, 2nd Edition","authors":["Clint Swindall"],"pages":"224","publication_date":"March 2011","description":"Praise for Engaged Leadership, second edition\n\n\"Engaged Leadership is the best of both worlds: an engaging business story coupled with a primer on the practical skills all leaders need.

Leadership development experts Jay Conger and Allan Church draw upon decades of research and experience--designing high-potential programs for hundreds of large well-known global organizations and assessing and coaching thousands of talented leaders--to answer the critical questions asked by ambitious individuals like you: What will it take for me to advance in this organization?

While it is today generally believed that the transition from 'hard' and inflexible commodity money (such as a gold standard) to entirely flexible and potentially unlimited fiat money under national central banks allows for superior economic stability, Paper Money Collapse shows that the opposite is true. Systems of highly elastic and constantly expanding money are not only unnecessary, even for growing economies, they are always extremely destabilizing. Over time, they must lead to substantial imbalances, including excessive levels of debt and distorted asset prices, that will require ever faster money production to sustain. Ultimately, however, there is no alternative to a complete liquidation of these distortions. Based on insights of many renowned economists and in particular of the Austrian School of Economics, the book explains through rigorous logic and in precise language why our system of flexible fiat money is incompatible with a market economy and therefore unsustainable. Paper money systems have always led to economic disintegration—without exception—throughout history. It will not be different for our system and we may be closer to the endgame than many think.\n\nThe updated second edition incorporates:\n\nA new introduction and an extended outlook section that discusses various \"endgames\"\n\nResponses to criticisms, alternative views, and a critical assessment of 'solutions'\n\nComments on recent policy trends, including attempts to exit the 'easy money' policy mode\n\nAn evaluation of new crypto-currency Bitcoin\n\nPaper Money Collapse: The Folly of Elastic Money, Second Edition clarifies the problem of paper money clearly and eloquently, and proposes multiple routes to a solution.","tags":["Business","Economics"]},{"id":"9780133474626","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Definitive Guide to Modern Supply Chain Management (Collection)","authors":["Chad W.

The author engages readers with an insightful and brief claim:  \"Values are more than numbers.\"  He then provides support for just how important human capital is to the value creation paradox.  He doesn't stop there because ideas without definitive actions don't promote transformation.  He further challenges the reader with:  \"If you don't think outside of the box, you're doomed to live in the box.\"A user-friendly manual chock full of vignettes, suggestions and pithy commentary EVE is a must read for owners, officers, boards and advisors to derive understanding of business value drivers.  This book teaches the reader how to conduct more intangible asset due diligence as well as what decisions and behaviors impact value. With more effective methods of risk identification, measurement, management, and mitigation (\"IMMM\"), trusted advisors and owners can establish a \"working on the business\" strategy to prioritize issues impacting a company's intangible assets – assets which almost inevitably create the largest component of value in flourishing companies. This focus also serves to reduce risk while leveraging human capital and operational effectiveness. This book challenges users of value enhancement and valuation services to demand greater intellectual rigor to best serve owners/investors of the United States' economic engine—the midmarket company. Therefore, readers are challenged to look beyond the common metrics and numbers.  They are admonished to rely less on formulaic approaches and on software that can generate spurious opinions. The reader is called to action by the author, a US Marine Combat Officer veteran, to lead the change: \"You burn the boats if you want to be sure you succeed taking the island.\"Trillions of dollars of private equity are changing hands as Baby Boomer owners and investors seek greater liquidity and legacies while investors seek higher returns from direct investment in private companies. This book provides risk and human capital guidance removing some of the guesswork on valuation and value creation.  •         Provide better evidence of value & equity discounts•         Identify and quantify risk and provide tools to manage it•         Inform better business management and investment decisions•         Create a more comprehensive valuation for equity investments•         Roadmap and strategy for enhancement of going concern valueGovernance, Risk and Compliance (\"GRC\") management are hot topics in today's economic environment. The familiar financial metrics may not be providing adequate indications of value creation – the core principle of most shareholder investment expectation. To identify risk and work with it effectively, practitioners need an in-depth understanding of the forces at play. Equity Value Enhancement is a detailed, insightful guide for making better equity decisions. Finally, the author puts his passion front and center by offering the reader the opportunity to invest in the human capital this book addresses by encouraging support of military veteran's with combat PTSD so they may be productive citizens with the leadership and business skills provided by our country's \"Greatest Generation.\"","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Corporate Valuation"]},{"id":"0738489565","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"ILM Library: Information Lifecycle Management Best Practices Guide","authors":["Babette Haeusser","Alex Osuna","Christian Bosman"],"pages":"320","publication_date":"February 2007","description":"This IBM Redbooks publication focuses on business requirements for information retention.\n\nWe provide practical recommendations for implementing a robust information management strategy.

Everyone who works must deal with countless emails, constant communication, cascading deadlines, and seemingly endless meetings. These can be managed efficiently, or they can be a huge time suck. When you're surrounded by slow-moving coworkers, you're stuck in a traffic jam of sorts. What makes the difference isn't individuals working harder or faster or smarter but “teaming well.” You have at your disposal what Stack calls “the most powerful productivity machine in existence”: your team. Individual productivity is just the beginning of business profitability; the real winner is team productivity. A good team can accomplish more, and more quickly, than any one Lone Ranger. Yes, there are always stars—in sports, Peyton Manning, Mia Hamm, and Stephen Curry come to mind—but they couldn't do their jobs without the rest of the team doing theirs. Bestselling author Laura Stack's FAST model mobilizes teams to be the most effective they can be, while keeping each other's best interests at heart. Using her original model, teams learn to work together Fairly, accept Accountability, apply Systems Thinking, and maximize available Technology. An interactive assessment helps you evaluate your team's current speed and rate of acceleration. By the end of this book, you'll truly understand the abilities of your team. Team members will ask themselves, “How can I help my team go faster together?” You work to save everyone else time, and they work to save you time. For your business to win, everyone must contribute.

Although he didn’t approach marketing with the same systematic rigor he reserved for management, Drucker addressed the topic in detail in his wellknown treatises on the roles of profitability and leadership, the importance of innovation, and the need to seize new opportunities.\n\nDrucker on Marketing is the first comprehensive look at the marketing wisdom of one of modern history's most influential business thinkers.\n\nA former student of Peter Drucker, William Cohen has sifted through Drucker's huge body of work, singled out his most salient ideas on marketing, and constructed them into a framework that not only outlines Drucker's marketing philosophy but provides practical advice on how to achieve marketing goals in today's business setting. The book is organized into five thematic sections:\n\nThe Ascendancy of Marketing\nInnovation and Entrepreneurship\nDrucker's Marketing Strategy\nNew Product and Service Introduction\nDrucker's Unique Marketing Insights\n\nFor Drucker, profitability should not be the main focus of a business. The customer should be; the market should be. He didn't consider marketing as one of many tools to generate profits. Rather, he viewed marketing as the driving force of business, a philosophy for defining and capturing the most enriching customer opportunities.\n\nProviding unique insight into the mind of one of the twentieth century's greatest thinkers, Drucker on Marketing is an essential read for both marketing professionals and fans of Peter Drucker.\n\nPraise for Drucker on Marketing\n\n\"Bill Cohen's interpretation of Drucker's work has never been needed more than today, when marketing spells the difference between success and failure.\" -- Frances Hesselbein, President and CEO, The Frances Hesselbein Leadership Institute\n\n\"It is my desire that those in positions of influence, especially executives, professors, and students, take Cohen's advice in this book to heart and help their organizations to help us all.\" -- Joseph A.

They are dealing with global competition, very rapid change in technologies, and tremendous volatility in economic conditions. As project managers, we are helping our companies survive in this difficult landscape. We are “agents of change” and “drivers of change.”\n\nThe most important project management methodology today that will help us deal with this change and this volatility is Agile. However, no one process or project management methodology fits all situations! Agile is not a panacea for all projects. Many times, our projects are large enough and complex enough that some parts of the project are best suited to using a predictive planning approach, and other parts are more suited to using Agile. Therefore, a hybrid approach that mixes the traditional, waterfall approach with Agile is really required in many situations today.\n\nThe agile community oftentimes has quite a negative view of hybrid approaches. Key writers on Agile often say that attempting to use hybrid will corrupt all attempts to use Agile, and will result in failure. In this book, the argument is made that integrating these methodologies can be done if approached the right way, and in fact, this is necessary today.","tags":["Business","Project & Product Management","Project Management"]},{"id":"9781482243239","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Creating a Lean Culture, 3rd Edition","authors":["David Mann"],"pages":"407","publication_date":"October 2014","description":"Winner of a Shingo Research and Professional Publication Award\n\nThe new edition of this Shingo Prize-winning bestseller provides critical insights and approaches to make any Lean transformation an ongoing success.

You have to renew your business model.\n\nIn a global market that is constantly evolving, you can’t expect “magic bullets” or “best practices”—or any stand-alone business philosophy that many books and gurus offer—to guide your company through good times and bad. Instead you need to take an active role in reviewing and retooling your strategies. You need to stop thinking “business as usual.” You need Business Model Renewal—a groundbreaking book that provides a language and multiple frameworks for how to think about and implement business model reinvention.\n\nA full-range guide to synthesizing and applying the most up-to-date thinking in business today, Business Model Renewal challenges you to re-evaluate your methods, rethink your options, and reignite your organization. Constantly challenging the mindset of “tried and true” numbers-based solutions such as market share, financials, and metrics, Gorchels integrates both traditional concepts and cutting-edge ideas to avoid the usual “one size fits all” approach that can stifle a company’s growth. You’ll learn how to build a custom-made business model that encompasses the totality of how your company produces value—including design, infrastructure, culture, operations, and more. You’ll learn how to adapt to newest emerging technologies, how to cope with the biggest market fluctuations, how to serve the latest demographic shifts, and how to plan ahead for your company’s future.\n\nEnvisioning business model renewal efforts drives leaders and managers to deal with the ambiguity of future thinking. Shifts in technology, market needs, and competitive arenas can never be known precisely, but must nevertheless be anticipated. Scenario planning and other group-based, collaborative efforts to study the future are therefore necessary components of business model renewal. So, too, is corporate culture, decision making, business model portfolio design, and change management.\n\nThat’s why the frameworks in this book touch on all of these facets. Business Model Renewal won’t give you seven proven steps, five key principles, or even 10 irrefutable laws. But it will challenge you to do the hard work of broadening the perspectives of your firm, the ecosystem in which it exists, the role of your personal leadership, and the followership within your corporate culture.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy"]},{"id":"9780429822971","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Strategic Corporate Responsibility","authors":["Ulpiana Kocollari"],"pages":"182","publication_date":"May 2018","description":"The book contains original theoretical and empirical material and attention is paid to the principal social and environmental impact measurement models, analysing their main features so as to pinpoint their adequacy in assessing the social dimension and to tailor their use more closely to the specific patterns to which they refer.

But with his focus on \"the market\" as the best mechanism for producing and distributing the necessities of life, Smith's concepts only told part of the story, leading to flawed economic models that devalue activities that fall outside of the market's parameters of buying and selling. The real wealth of nations, Riane Eisler argues, is not merely financial, but includes the contributions of people and our natural environment. Here, Eisler goes beyond the market to reexamine economics from a larger perspective--and shows that we must give visibility and value to the socially and economically essential work of caring for people and the planet if we are to meet the enormous challenges we are facing.Eisler proposes a new \"caring economics\" that takes into account the full spectrum of economic activities--from the life--sustaining activities of the household, to the life-enriching activities of caregivers and communities, to the life-supporting processes of nature. She shows how our values are distorted by the economic double standard that devalues anything stereotypically associated with women and femininity; reveals how current economic models are based on a deep-seated culture of domination; and shows how human needs would be better served by economic models based on caring. Most importantly, she provides practical proposals for new economic inventions--new measures, policies, rules, and practices--to bring about a caring economics that fulfills human needs.Like her classic The Chalice and the Blade, The Real Wealth of Nations is a bold and insightful look at how to create a society in which each of us can achieve the full measure of our humanity.","tags":["Business","Economics"]},{"id":"9780750687102","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Managing and Delivering Performance","authors":["Bernard Marr"],"pages":"312","publication_date":"February 2009","description":"Performance management is at the top of agendas in most government and public organizations, as well as many not-for-profit organizations.

When people and organizations rest on prior successes rather than driving purposeful transformation, they discover too late that they have lost their market position altogether to competitors and external forces.\n\nThe most successful companies, brands, and individuals make reinvention a regular part of their business strategies. Transformation demands an ongoing process of discovery and imagination, and The Road to Reinvention lays out a systematic approach for continually challenging and reinventing yourself and your business. Venture capitalist and serial entrepreneur Josh Linkner identifies six elements in any business that are ripe for reinvention and shares examples, methods, and step-by-step techniques for creating deliberate, productive disruption.\n\nThroughout The Road to Reinvention, Linkner also explores the history—the great rise, unprecedented fall, and now rebirth—of his beloved hometown, Detroit. First rising to greatness as the result of breathtaking innovation, Detroit had generations of booming growth before succumbing to apathy, atrophy, and finally bankruptcy. Now, the city is rising from the ashes and driving sustainable success through an intense focus on reinvention. Linkner brings an insider's view of this incredible story of grit, determination, and creativity, sharing his perspective on Detroit's successes and setbacks as a profound example of large-scale organizational and personal transformation.\n\nChange is inevitable. You need to decide: Will you drive that change, or be driven away by it? Will you disrupt or be disrupted? By choosing to deliberately reimagine your own status quo, you can secure a strong future for both your company and your career.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Innovation"]},{"id":"0814478808","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Red-Hot Cold Call Selling: Prospecting Techniques That Pay Off","authors":["Paul S.

Think of the impact this would have on recruitment, retention, customer satisfaction, innovation, and overall performance. Aron Ain, the award-winning CEO of Kronos, a global provider of workforce management and human capital management cloud solutions, believes that anything is possible when people are inspired. By embracing employee development and engagement as a growth strategy, Ain transformed his company’s culture and built a billion-dollar business. This book takes leaders and managers inside Kronos’s highly admired WorkInspired culture, showing them the surprisingly simple rules to follow to replicate that success.\nAin’s inspiring guide reveals the best practices that have earned Kronos distinctions on coveted lists, such as Glassdoor’s 100 Best Places to Work, Fortune’s 100 Best Companies to Work For, Forbes’s America’s Best Employers, and the Boston Globe’s Top Places to Work. These include over-communicating and truth-telling, trusting your people again and again, holding managers accountable for being great at what they do, allowing employees flexible schedules and open vacation time, challenging your people to put the company out of business with new and revolutionary ideas, and welcoming back boomerang employees.

Every organization attempts to lower overhead while increasing donations, but this often proves to be impossible within existing frameworks. Effective fundraising - increasing donations while engaging more donors and lowering costs - requires a sound strategy that turns major roadblocks into minor hurdles that are easily overcome. It's not about trying harder, it's about working smarter.\n\nFundraising the SMART Way provides the groundwork for a complete revamp of organizational fundraising systems. Author Ellen Bristol applies twenty years of corporate sales experience and eighteen years in fund development consultation to the problem of inefficient fundraising. Bristol turns her extensive sales expertise toward the perspective of \"selling\" an organization to potential donors, increasing the donor pool, and lowering the cost of fundraising. The book details the questions every nonprofit should be asking to maximize the effectiveness of fundraising efforts, and encourages systematic strategy development by zeroing in on key factors such as:\n\nOrganizational goals, strengths, and weaknesses\n\nDonor actions and motivations\n\nWorkload management and results QA\n\nOpportunity evaluation and organizational action\n\nThe book outlines clear, concrete, actionable steps that can be immediately implemented to escalate income growth. Effective fundraising is sustainable, consistent, and on-target. It must exceed current need and expand to fill future need.

It’s not about privileges, luck, or working harder. There’s a template that the world’s fastest growing companies follow to achieve and sustain much, much faster growth.\n\nFrom Impossible to Inevitable details the hypergrowth playbook of companies like the record-breaking Zenefits (which skyrocketed from $1 million to $100 million in two years), Salesforce.com (the fastest growing multibillion dollar software company), and EchoSign—aka Adobe Document Services—(which catapulted from $0 to $144 million in seven years). Whether you have a $1 billion or a $100,000 business, you can use the same insights as these notable companies to learn what it really takes to break your own revenue records. For instance, one of the authors shows how he grew his income from $67,000 to $720,000 in four years while maintaining a 20-30 hour work week and welcoming a new child—nine times.\n\nThis book shows you how to surpass plateaus and get off of the up-and-down revenue rollercoaster by answering three questions about growing revenue to tens times its size:\n\nWhy aren’t you growing faster?\nWhat does it take to get to hypergrowth?\nHow do you sustain growth?\n\nThis powerful, effective book provides a template for you to kick off your biggest growth spurt yet.

Jobs that traditionally required few skills now demand an increasingly broad range of abilities. This reflects the requirement for broader skill sets and increased worker flexibility. Surviving as a worker today is all about managing extra responsibilities and an ever-increasing range of day-to-day duties.\n\nYou can earn more, learn more, and go further in life by moving up the value chain—a broad term that represents the way in which your skills widen and deepen over time. In the workplace, you move up the value chain by acquiring and applying relevant new skills and knowledge and then using them to rapidly solve difficult problems.\n\nYou can prepare yourself for the growing levels of commitment and flexibility demanded by your employment. Moving Your Career Up the Value Chain will help by teaching concrete methods of evaluating your current position and striking forward to make improvements. You'll learn how to:\n\nPick an area of specialization\n\nEnlist mentors for help along your path\n\nUse technology to your advantage\n\nImprove your planning and time-management skills\n\nPractice active learning to develop new skills\n\nPut your new skills to work in the marketplace\n\nThey say every journey begins with a single step. It is the same thing with moving up the value chain. There is no single destination in this journey. There are always areas in our lives where some improvement is warranted. Moving Your Career Up the Value Chain will help you find those areas and make the necessary improvements to propel your career—and life—to the next level.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Career Development"]},{"id":"9781119231110","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Coaching Up! Inspiring Peak Performance When It Matters Most","authors":["Jordan Fliegel","Kathleen Landis Lancaster","Shane Battier"],"pages":"208","publication_date":"October 2016","description":"Connect, engage, motivate, and inspire using top coaching techniques\n\nCoaching Up! is about inspiring those who matter to you to achieve peak performance. Whether you are a coach, a business leader, a civic activist, a teacher, a counselor, or a parent, this book will offer you a powerful, highly effective way to connect to the people you care about and move them forward toward their best selves. In sports, coaches have developed ways of connecting with their players quickly in the \"heat of the battle,\" inspiring them to perform to their fullest potential and \"leave it all on the field.\" Interestingly, although these techniques have not been codified, great coaches have independently developed remarkably similar models. This book aligns these techniques and distills their essence into a fundamental skill set that anyone can use to connect with, support, and inspire his or her colleagues, teammates, friends, and family members. At its foundation, great coaching is based on a solid set of techniques that can be applied to all areas of life. Essentially, those skills boil down to forging authentic connections, providing genuine support, and offering concise direction.\n\nWhile our everyday pressures may be less intense than those of a championship, the long-term game is even more important. Why not borrow from the best to develop the skills and abilities to win every day?\n\nInspire and motivate people to higher performance\nImprove communication in high-stakes situations\nBe more effective both professionally and socially\n\nGetting inside the way great coaching works gives you an unparalleled glimpse at the core of inspiration. A great coach can make the difference between a mediocre player and a world champion. What would that difference look like if you could inspire every colleague in your business? Everyone who matters to you in your personal life? You can be the source of empowerment and motivation that helps the people around you reach higher, go further, and achieve more. Coaching Up! gives you the game plan—and shows you how to run the plays.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Executive Coaching"]},{"id":"9781628251463","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Expert Judgment in Project Management: Narrowing the Theory-Practice Gap","authors":["Paul S.

In truth, though, they just fall back on exclusionary behaviors, like revering the typically male \"lone genius\" who is essential to their innovative future. Why the disconnect?\n\nAccording to Telle Whitney, cofounder of the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing, while tech leaders may want to talk about inclusivity, few actually change their cultures to dismantle the unwelcoming environment, fearful that doing so will compromise innovation. Women and people of color pay the price, facing exclusive and even hostile workplaces. They're held back from professional growth and, in many cases, choose to leave the industry altogether.\n\nBut there is a solution. In Rebooting Tech Culture, Whitney argues that the same values at the heart of innovation—creativity, courage, confidence, curiosity, communication, and community—can also foster a culture that’s welcoming to all employees. Drawing on more than fifty interviews with tech executives and a survey of a thousand people in tech, she shows how these \"six Cs\" can power real change in technology organizations, creating workplaces where anyone can be successful and where innovation thrives.\n\nToday, every company is a tech company. By understanding how to apply these values and reinvigorate their cultures, leaders will learn how to eliminate the behaviors holding their teams back from true belonging, growth, and innovation.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Culture in Business"]},{"id":"9783110704938","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Fintech Business Models","authors":["Matthias Fischer"],"pages":"311","publication_date":"February 2021","description":"This book on fintechs shows an international comparison on a global level.

He also explains how to interpret news coverage of the markets to get a sense of when participants have become overly bullish or bearish. Saettele points out that several famous traders such as George Soros and Robert Prechter made huge profits by identifying shifts in crowd sentiment at major market turning points.

Today's new, young workforce has so much to offer—new technical skills, new ideas, new perspective, new energy. Yet too many of them are held back because of their weak soft skills.\n\nSoft skills may be harder to define and measure than hard skills, but they are just as critical. People get hired because of their hard skills but get fired because of their soft skills.\n\nSetting a good example or simply telling young workers they need to improve isn't enough, nor is scolding them or pointing out their failings in an annual review. However you can teach the missing basics to today's young talent.\n\nBased on more than twenty years of research, Bruce Tulgan, renowned expert on the millennial workforce, offers concrete solutions to help managers teach the missing basics of professionalism, critical thinking, and followership—complete with ninety-two step-by-step lesson plans designed to be highly flexible and easy to use.\n\nTulgan's research and proven approach has show that the key to teaching young people the missing soft skills lies in breaking down critical soft skills into their component parts, concentrating on one small component at a time, with the help of a teaching-style manager. Almost all of the exercises can be done in less than an hour within a team meeting or an extended one-on-one. The exercises are easily modified and customized and can be used as take-home exercises for any individual or group, to guide one-on-one discussions with direct-reports and in the classroom as written exercises or group discussions.\n\nManagers—and their young employees—will find themselves returning to their favorite exercises over and over again.

As new technology and digital strategies are integrated, workers at all levels will be required to build capability much faster than before, navigating more complex systems and processes. Yet, learning and development (L&D) has lagged in this area, as too many L&D functions still focus on transactional interactions across a broad and complex portfolio while starved for resources.\n\nIn L&D’s Playbook for the Digital Age, Brandon Carson makes the case that it’s time to reorient L&D, take a more proactive role in enabling the workforce, and create a new framework for developing skills and capabilities. L&D leaders must realize theirs is one of the most critical business functions and must be appropriately funded and resourced to realize the performance gains that are crucial to the business.\n\nL&D cannot be caught standing still and, in fact, needs a new playbook to navigate the radical and complex transformation the digital age is demanding. Stemming from the sports world, a playbook ensures the players know their roles, connect as a team, and understand the winning strategy and how to execute the game plan. For L&D, a playbook can help build alignment across the team and with stakeholders by being flexible as business needs change.\n\nCarson walks you through the steps to formulate how a new playbook could help the alignment of your L&D function—whether it’s restructuring, new skilling, or rescoping. He asks readers to speak the language of business instead of the language of learning. For example, does your workforce repair aircraft or do they enable safe flight?

Complex change is costly, difficult, and has a high degree of risk. By definition, complex change requires individuals within the organization to make significant changes in how they fulfill the duties associated with their role. Things like moving to a new technology platform, going through a merger, organizational restructuring, and adding or eliminating a product or service all involve complex change. In 1990, Peter Senge’s book The Fifth Discipline was published, and the concept of organizational change management was introduced into the business world. Since then, analysis of data from thousands of change implementations point to the same conclusion – approximately 70% of change projects fail to achieve their defined goals. This data also shows that the 30% of projects that do meet expected ROI all found a way to effectively address the people side of change. This book introduces the concept of integrated organizational change methodology (iOCM™), which provides a framework for integrating best practice organizational change management principles into all facets of a change plan, resulting in significantly improved project outcomes and maximum return on investment.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Change Management"]},{"id":"9781118103135","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The New Technology Elite: How Great Companies Optimize Both Technology Consumption and Production","authors":["Vinnie Mirchandani"],"pages":"400","publication_date":"March 2012","description":"How-to guidance for optimizing incumbent technologies to deliver a better product and gain competitive advantage\n\nTheir zip codes are far from Silicon Valley.

Companies try to address this by formalizing innovation processes. However, such programs, when they succeed, often produce only a portion of the growth that most large organizations require. Many innovation programs fail to meet expectations, in part because they separate the innovation process from the informal networks needed to adapt and support an innovation.The authors argue that executives need to better support emergent innovation to supplement planned new product or service development activities. Successful service, product, or process innovations within large, complex organizations are, the authors contend, very much a social phenomenon. This is why organizations that are routinely innovative are intentional about enabling individuals to engage and connect in ways that trigger and expand ideas. How can organizations best connect employees in ways that more systematically unleash emergent innovation? The authors’ research suggests that part of the answer lies in the power of network structures and the ability of organizations to create what the authors call adaptive space. They define adaptive space as the network and organizational context that allows people, ideas, information, and resources to flow across the organization and spur successful emergent innovation. Adaptive space works by enabling ideas generated in entrepreneurial pockets of an organization to flow into the operational system to generate innovations that lead to growth. Adaptive space within organizations is fluid and can shift based on need. Companies create adaptive space through environments that open up information flows and enrich idea discovery, development, and amplification. That can be done in a number of ways. For example, the nonprofit research corporation Noblis created adaptive space through an internal crowdsourcing initiative, while General Motors has generated adaptive space through events that bring together people from different parts of the organization. Using network analysis and data collected from more than 400 interviews, the authors found that innovation leaders within an organization engaged with experts, influencers, and decision-makers through different phases of an innovation’s journey, and in the process managed to substantially expand the impact of their innovation and streamline its acceptance as it moved from concept to implementation. The authors also describe three roles critical for emergent innovation: brokers (who create bridges between different groups), central connectors (who have extensive connections in one cohesive subgroup), and energizers (who generate enthusiasm for new ideas).","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Innovation"]},{"id":"9780749454562","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Retail Value Chain","authors":["Sami Finne","Hanna Sivonen"],"pages":"384","publication_date":"December 2008","description":"Gain critical insight into why retail operates the way it does and implement efficient consumer response strategies.","tags":["Business","Operations","Supply Chain Management"]},{"id":"9781119291756","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Aligned to Achieve","authors":["Tracy Eiler","Andrea Austin"],"pages":"208","publication_date":"September 2016","description":"A smart, practical guide to rocket-powered business growth\n\nAligned to Achieve puts sales and marketing on the same page, creating a revenue 'dream team' that will drive your organization to new heights.

Cleland"],"pages":"227","publication_date":"October 2013","description":"Business of all sizes have a problem: How do you know—in real time—whether you are earning the profit you need to grow or even just stay in business? And which products or services are doing the \"heavy lifting\" in contributing to profit? Financial statements tell only part of the story. They are backward looking, for one thing, and they generally show results only in the aggregate. Worse, they never seem to reflect the hard work you're doing on a daily basis. As one manager said, \"If I'm adding 25% profit to every job, why am I getting barely 5% net profit at the end of the year?\"\n\nImproving Profit: Using Contribution Metrics to Boost the Bottom Line solves this dilemma. As this book shows, Contribution-Based Activity (CBA) measures focus on two key levers that are fundamental to the operation of any business: financial contribution and units of activity. Knowing how to use these levers gets your company off the treadmill and on your way to stellar profitability. And as the 21 case studies show, CBA is surprisingly easy to apply to businesses of all types and all sizes.\n\nWhat is \"financial contribution\"? Simply the amount above and beyond the cost of goods or materials sold that contributes to covering overhead and creating profit. As entrepreneur, business consultant, and professor Keith Cleland shows, few managers actually know the financial contribution their products and services make, nor how to amplify that contribution by incremental adjustments to one or both levers. As you'll learn, the financial tool Cleland created, TARI (Target Average Rate Index), provides insight into each product's value. You'll not only learn which products are contributing the most to the bottom line, but how to unlock the profit potential in run-of-the-mill products or services. Improving Profit will help you:\n\nRestore and boost profit levels for your entire operation\n\nRelate your daily efforts to a transaction's actual profitability\n\nFocus on the two key performance indicators that can help you identify and solve problems affecting finance and productivity\n\nHelp everyone in the company—from CEO to janitor—understand how their activities help or hinder the company's fortunes\n\nMake effective financial decisions\n\nIf you've ever wondered why your results don't match your hard work, hopes, and dreams, read this book. As the case studies make clear, identifying and applying TARI results in a significant—and often dramatic—boost to the bottom-line.\n\nWhat you'll learn\n\nReaders will learn to:\n\nImprove the profitability of a job, product, service, or department\n\nPrice products and services correctly\n\nConserve cash and avoid financial crunches\n\nWin desirable quotes and tenders\n\nIdentify and track productivity\n\nWho this book is for\n\nThis book is for business managers, directors, consultants, students, professors, CPAs, and business advisers of all types.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy"]},{"id":"9781119960676","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Frequently Asked Questions on IFRS","authors":["Steven Collings"],"pages":"416","publication_date":"April 2013","description":"A concise FAQ guide to IFRS principles and practices\n\nCo-written by Steven Collings, winner of Accounting Technician of the Year at the British Accountancy Awards 2011, this book is a comprehensive guide to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) which became mandatory in the EU in 2005, and they will almost certainly be adopted by most other developed countries in the near future.

From its inception, marketing has been positioned as a support for the relationship between the company and its customers, with the quest for well-being set in the very foundations of the discipline. In a context that is marked by crises and much skepticism, marketing today should, more than ever, prove that it acts in good faith. This book offers practitioners, public authorities, professors and students illustrations that demonstrate that the dissemination of sustainable practices is indeed a marketing issue.

Now, you face difficult and stubborn questions about how to implement that decision: How, when, and where should we apply automation in our organization? Is it a stark choice between humans versus machines? How do we stay on top of these technological trends as work and automation continue to evolve?\n\nWork and human capital experts Ravin Jesuthasan and John Boudreau present leaders with a new set of tools to answer these daunting questions. Transcending the endless debate about humans being replaced by machines, Jesuthasan and Boudreau show how smart leaders instead are optimizing human-automation combinations that are not only more efficient but also generate higher returns on improved performance.\n\nBased on groundbreaking primary research, Reinventing Jobs provides an original, structured approach of four distinct steps--deconstruct, optimize, automate, and reconfigure--to help leaders reinvent how work gets bundled into jobs and create optimal human-machine combinations. Jesuthasan and Boudreau show leaders how to continuously reexamine what a job really is, and they provide the tools for identifying the pivotal performance value of tasks within jobs and how these tasks should be reconstructed into new, more optimal combinations.\n\nWith numerous examples and practical advice for applying the four-step process, Reinventing Jobs gives leaders a more precise, planful, and actionable way to decide how, when, and where to apply and optimize work automation.","tags":["Business","Human Resources","Talent Management"]},{"id":"9781484200971","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Practical Salesforce.com Development Without Code: Customizing Salesforce on the Force.com Platform","authors":["Philip Weinmeister"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"December 2014","description":"Are you facing a challenging Salesforce.com problem—say, relating to customization, configuration, reporting, dashboards, or formulation—that you can’t quite crack?

Clark goes where no one has gone before. One of today’s leading experts on the subject, Clark reveals that the business world has been focusing on only half the question—namely, the organization’s role in driving employee engagement. Clark points to the other interested party—the employee.\n\nThrough extensive research, the author has discovered that approximately 75 percent of employees are not fully engaged with their work—a frighteningly high number with frighteningly dire consequences for both companies and individual employees. The Employee Engagement Mindset is a step-by-step guide to reversing this pattern, one employee at a time. Clark breaks it all down into six key behaviors:\n\nConnecting: Form solid relationships with coworkers and align your behavior to the organization’s culture and goalsShaping: Seize opportunities for tailoring experiences based on your personal preferencesLearning: Take proactive measures to learn at or above the speed of changeStretching: Move out of your comfort zone and take calculated risksAchieving: Accomplish your goalsContributing: Make personal contributions that drive lasting positive change to others and to the company\n\nThe Employee Engagement Mindset provides practical advice on how any employee can put him or herself on the fast track to true engagement using this six-part model. Simply put, every engaged employee is worth his or her weight in gold. Whether you’re in charge of driving employee engagement or feel the need to take personal responsibility for excelling at work, The Employee Engagement Mindset tells you everything you need to know.\n\n\"Clark and his team discovered some surprising truths about highly engaged people that cross cultural, demographic, and industry lines. The Employee Engagement Mindset unlocks the door to our own personal and professional connectedness.\"—Marshall Goldsmith, author of the New York Times bestsellers MOJO and What Got You Here Won’t Get You There\n\n\"[The Employee Engagement Mindset ] lays out in clear, practical terms how highly engaged people think and what they do. I highly recommend it.\"—Vai Sikahema, NBC Philadelphia sports anchor and former NFL All-Pro, Philadelphia Eagles\n\n\"[The Employee Engagement Mindset] captures the emerging search for meaning and purpose in organizations and offers fantastic concepts, tools, and examples of how to go beyond rhetoric to action and resolve.\"—Dave Ulrich, professor, Ross School of Business, University of Michigan and partner, The RBL Group\n\n\"There has been a lot written about employee engagement from the leader’s perspective. What excites me about The Employee Engagement Mindset is that it is written for employees.

Mangelsdorf"],"pages":"5","publication_date":"January 2018","description":"Many companies are paying increased attention to workplace diversity — issues such as how to increasediversity, how to foster sensitivity to it, and how to manage a diverse workforce. But, according to MITSloan School of Management professor Evan Apfelbaum, managers should also factor in issues associatedwith a related problem: workplace homogeneity. In this interview with MIT Sloan Management Revieweditorial director Martha E. Mangelsdorf, Apfelbaum explains why diverse groups are sometimes able toreach better decisions than homogenous groups. Recent research, including Apfelbaum's own, has found,for example, that racially homogeneous groups are less rigorous in their decision-making — and makemore mistakes — than groups composed of people with racially diverse backgrounds.For example, Apfelbaum notes that in a study that compared trading practices of homogeneous anddiverse groups in both Asia and the U.S., members of the racially homogeneous groups showed a greaterwillingness to pay more than things were worth. What's more, people within such groups were \"more likelyto copy another person's mistake — presumably assuming that the mistake had some value that they justdidn't understand.\" According to Apfelbaum, this finding suggests \"that there is something fundamentalabout working with similar versus different others that affects individuals' decision-making.\" Other studieshave similarly indicated that diverse groups have fewer blind spots. In diverse groups, Apfelbaum says,people are more likely to \"come to an independent assessment of what they think to be the case.\"In the interview, Apfelbaum observes that \"diversity can be both advantageous and complicated inthe workplace and in decision-making groups.\" Many people in social settings gravitate toward peoplewith similar backgrounds, and research has also shown that diverse groups can experience conflict andmistrust. However, conflict isn't necessarily a negative. In one study, for example, different groups wereasked to review identical information before reaching their recommendations. The diverse groupstended to consider more perspectives than the homogeneous ones and were more accurate in both theirdecisions and their assessments of their performance. The homogeneous groups had more confidencein their decisions, but those decisions were actually less accurate.","tags":["Business","Human Resources","Workforce Diversity"]},{"id":"9780137017379","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Value Above Cost: Driving Superior Financial Performance with CVA","authors":["Ph.D Donald E.

Columbia University's Don Sexton fully identifies the real drivers of shareholder value, unifying key concepts from marketing, branding, economics, management, finance, accounting, and statistics. Sexton introduces a powerful new metric: Customer Value Added (CVA), the difference between customer-perceived value and variable cost per unit. Next, he demonstrates CVA at work, presents research and case studies that prove its value, and shows how to use it to consistently measure, manage, and optimize profit, cash flow, and shareholder value. Readers will learn why CVA works; how to measure it; how changes in CVA correlate to changes in profits and cash flow; and how to use CVA to steer the enterprise. Along the way, Sexton illuminates CVA's key implications for managers, including why managers must focus attention simultaneously on both customers and costs, and why well-publicized \"generic strategies\" such as \"net recommend\" offer only part of the solution. Finally, drawing on his own extensive experience consulting on CVA and related issues, Sexton presents easy-to-use worksheets for translating CVA concepts into reality in your own organization.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Corporate Valuation"]},{"id":"0273645110","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Seven Cs of Consulting, The","authors":["Mick Cope"],"pages":"256","publication_date":"March 2000","description":"The consultancy business is booming.

Research has shown a failure rate of 70 percent in long-term multigenerational wealth management, and contrary to popular assumption, only five percent of that failure is due to bad investment, poor tax planning, or inadequate performance by legal and financial advisors. The number-one reason family wealth management fails is the family itself; poor communication, lack of trust, divergent visions, and a failure to prepare succeeding generations will tear down the resources the family has worked so hard to build. Traditional wealth management cannot fix this. Instead, this book offers a fresh approach that integrates strategic and tactical wealth management to align the family’s assets with the family members.  With helpful tools and advice drawn from a real-world understanding of family complexities, you’ll improve your ability to preserve your family’s resources over multiple generations.\n\nWith an expert’s perspective on the real forces behind successful family wealth management, this book provides a clear model and a practical roadmap for long-term financial preservation.\n\nDevelop a shared family vision and mission\nImprove communication and trust among members\nMerge strategic and tactical planning\nEnsure the longevity of your family’s wealth\n\nThe wealth management sphere tends to focus on taxes, investments, banking, and estate planning, but little thought is given to the people themselves—this overlooks the fact that individual family members are the most critical factor in multigenerational wealth management, and fails to provide solutions.

And with good reasonreorgs are one of the best ways for companies to unlock latent value, especially in a changing business environment.But everyone hates them.No other management practice creates more anxiety and fear among employees or does more to distract them from their day-to-day jobs. As a result, reorgs can be incredibly expensive in terms of senior-management time and attention, and most of them fail on multiple dimensions. It’s no wonder companies treat a reorg as a mysterious process and outsource it to people who don’t understand the business. It doesn’t have to be this way.Stephen Heidari-Robinson and Suzanne Heywood, former leaders in McKinsey’s Organization Practice, present a practical guide for successfully planning and implementing a reorg in five stepsdemystifying and accelerating the process at the same time. Based on their twenty-five years of combined experience managing reorgs and on McKinsey research with over 2,500 executives involved in them, the authors distill what they and their McKinsey colleagues have been practicing as an art” into a science” that executives can replicatein companies or business units large or small. It isn’t rocket science and it isn’t bogged down by a lot of organizational theory: the five steps give people a simple, logical process to follow, making it easier for everyoneboth the leaders and the employees who ultimately determine a reorg’s success or failureto commit themselves to and succeed in the new organization.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management"]},{"id":"9781118644126","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Managing the Transition to IFRS-Based Financial Reporting: A Practical Guide to Planning and Implementing a Transition to IFRS or National GAAP","authors":["Lisa Weaver"],"pages":"272","publication_date":"July 2014","description":"The one-stop guide to transitioning to IFRS financial reporting\n\nThe International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) have already been adopted in Europe, and plans are in place to transition to IFRS reporting in the UK, India, Japan, and other major economies.

Despite much investment and commitment, most firms struggle to do this. What, exactly, is getting in their way? World-renowned professors W. Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne, the authors of the best-selling book Blue Ocean Strategy have spent over a decade exploring that question. They have seen that the trouble lies in managers' mental models--ingrained assumptions and theories about the way the world works. Though these models may work perfectly well in mature markets, they undermine executives' attempts to discover uncontested new spaces with ample potential (blue oceans) and keep companies firmly anchored in existing spaces where competition is bloody (red oceans). In this bound version of their bestselling Harvard Business Review classic article, they describe how to break free of these red ocean traps. To do that, managers need to: (1) Focus on attracting new customers, not pleasing current customers; (2) Worry less about segmentation and more about what different segments have in common; (3) Understand that market creation is not synonymous with either technological innovation or creative destruction; and (3) Stop focusing on premium versus low-cost strategies.\n\nThe Harvard Business Review Classics series offers you the opportunity to make seminal Harvard Business Review articles a part of your permanent management library. Each highly readable volume contains a groundbreaking idea that continues to shape best practices and inspire countless managers around the world--and will have a direct impact on you today and for years to come.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy"]},{"id":"9781605093833","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Compromise Trap","authors":["Elizabeth Doty","Art Kleiner"],"pages":"312","publication_date":"November 2009","description":"Healthy compromise is necessary for accomplishing any meaningful goal with other people.

Snider and his colleagues lay the groundwork for achieving leadership success in any business. Snider's assertion is this: In leadership, moral character comes first. Without it, skills, competence, and even vision are useless. Here are just a few of the leadership axioms from the \"Cadet Prayer\":\n\nStrengthen and increase our admiration for honest dealing and clean thinking\nMake us to choose the harder right instead of the easier wrong\nEndow us with courage that is born of loyalty to all that is noble and worthy\nGuard us against flippancy and irreverence in the sacred things of life\nGrant us new ties of friendship and new opportunities of service\n\nHonesty. Transparency. Loyalty. Service. These aren't \"soft\" traits. The're the nuts and bolts of quality leadership. They're the hallmark of authentic leadership for the sake of it. And they are the rock-solid foundation on which stand leadership success and all that comes with it.\n\n\"In leadership,\" Snider writes, \"being precedes doing.\" This timeless truth is the first step toward leadership excellence in any walk of life. The Warrior's Character will take you the rest of the way.\n\nWest Point's nondenominational \"Cadet Prayer\" has instilled the values of moral leadership in its cadets for nearly 100 years.

Answer: Plasticity. They can change, adapt, and excel as the situation requires.\n\nIn most organizations, strategy and functional excellence get the most attention. But even the best of either provides only limited long-term advantage. Highly effective organizations add Plasticity as a third dimension and rack up stellar breakthroughs-again and again. It is the key ingredient that allows strategy and functional excellence to deliver value.\n\nAs the authors show in Corporate Plasticity: How to Change, Adapt, and Excel, Plasticity also enables great organizations to break down barriers and collaborate in the pursuit of a common objective, and to reconfigure or rewire themselves to face down challenges or reach ever-stronger competitive positions.\n\nThrough entertaining stories and astute analysis, this book demonstrates that Plasticity spurs sports teams to become champions, companies to book record earnings, and artists to attain worldwide fame. You can use its principles-adaptability, flexibility, fluid networks and roles, lofty goals, and innovation, among others-to achieve operational excellence, tear down silos, and create more vibrant, creative enterprises. Your organization can become not just highly profitable and fun to work for, but an organization that can change the world.\n\nPlasticity allows an organization to choose its own destiny, become versatile, and dare more than others. Its success lies in a set of abilities called the Magic 7:\n\nPurpose: Your company must discover, select, and express what it is meant for.\nFocus: Your company must have the courage to ignore everything that is not in line with its purpose, and then see that purpose through.\nCulture: Your company must create the conditions that allow people to work across boundaries and outside of predefined roles.\nSpirit: Your company must inspire people to feel part of a cause that is bigger than they are.\nNetworking: Your company must provide the means, freedom, and encouragement for people to nurture and grow their internal and external networks continuously.\nKnowledge: Your company must encourage experts to provide their knowledge and make it readily available to everyone who needs it.\nLeadership: Your company's leaders must model and personify the characteristics they want others to adopt.\n\nSilo thinking? Poor collaboration? Weak earnings? Strategies that gain no traction? Corporate Plasticity: How to Change, Adapt, and Excel is the answer. It shows you how to cultivate each of the seven disciplines to infuse Plasticity in an organization. That-along with razor-sharp strategy and crisp execution-will unleash the power you need to reach both personal and corporate goals. You might even change the world.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy"]},{"id":"9781118094525","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Zombie Banks: How Broken Banks and Debtor Nations are Crippling the Global Economy","authors":["YALMAN ONARAN"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"November 2011","description":"An in-depth look at the essential issues surrounding zombie institutions and their effect on the global economy\n\n\"The title is worthy of a B movie, but it's also apt. Bloomberg News reporter Yalman Onaran, supported by former U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. chief Sheila Bair - who provides a foreword and numerous interviews - urge that insolvent banks both small and too big to fail be allowed to do precisely that. Reading bank balance sheets is not everyone's idea of a good time. But Mr. Onaran, with support from Ms. Bair, does the chore and explains what it means. Mr. Onaran shows that the process of rescuing dead and dying banks is increasing systemic risk in the global banking system. And that is really more frightening than scream flicks from Tinseltown.\" -- Financial Post\n\nZombie banking has become standard operating procedure for big debtor nations. They prop up failing institutions, print money, and avoid financial corrections. But in an attempt to prolong the inevitable, bigger problems are created. The approach used now has not, and will not, work. This timely book reveals why. Zombie Banks tells the story of how debtor nations and failing institutions are damaging the long-term prospects of the global economy.\n\nAuthor Yalman Onaran, a veteran Bloomberg News reporter and financial banking sector expert, examines exactly what a zombie bank is and why they are kept alive. He also discusses how they hurt economic recovery and what needs to be done in order to restore stability. Along the way, Onaran takes an honest look at how we arrived at this point and details the harsh realities that must be faced, and the serious steps that must be taken, in order to get things headed in the right direction.\n\nPuts insolvent banks and debtor nations in the spotlight and examines how they are crippling the global economy\n\nOn the record sources include Paul Volcker, Joseph Stiglitz, Sheila Bair, and many more bank executives, regulators, politicians, and policymakers in the United States and abroad\n\nTakes the complexity of the current situation and translates it in a way that makes it understandable\n\nWhile the short-term measures taken to stave off depression and rejuvenate economic growth may offer hope, they are unsustainable over the long term.

The spirit in our workplace, to say nothing of our own spirit, is getting a little tattered, showing the early stages of what Harrison Owen calls \"Soul Pollution.\" Those in the advanced stages may find themselves plagued by exhaustion, high levels of stress, and the abuse of just about anything in sight, including spouses, substances, and fellow workers. So what is the secret to transforming organizations? The answer, says Owen, is simple: we must consciously be what we already are-natural, open, self-organizing systems.In The Power of Spirit, Owen examines the world of Spirit/Consciousness in organizations and offers help to those who find themselves dreading another day on the job in an organization seemingly bent on its own destruction, as well as the destruction of its members. He draws from what we are now learning about self-organizing systems to provides a practical application to the world of organizations, revealing the ways in which Spirit shows up in new, emergent organizational forms.Widely known for his Open Space Technology-a broadly used meeting management tool-Owen now pushes well beyond that surface appreciation and suggests deeper applications and implications, showing how what has been experienced in a typical \"great meeting\" with Open Space can actually be a 365-day-a-year reality.For all those interested in Spirit and spirituality, particularly in the workplace, individuals who are feeling down and out and buried by Soul Pollution in the workplace, and for current practitioners of Open Space Technology who are wondering what comes after a \"great meeting\"-The Power of Spirit will offer a pathway to positive transformation.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Development"]},{"id":"9781786305756","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Open Innovation","authors":["Pascal Latouche"],"pages":"272","publication_date":"November 2020","description":"The purpose of this book is to explicitly describe the daily interactions that need to be implemented to transform these One To One, or One to Many, interactions into tangible (business partnerships) and intangible (relationship satisfaction) value.

Davidson"],"pages":"240","publication_date":"December 2011","description":"The idea for this book came to Martin Davidson during a disarmingly honest conversation with a CFO he worked with. “Look,” the executive said, clearly troubled. “I know we can get a diverse group of people around the table. But so what? What difference does it really make to getting bottom-line results?”Answering the “so what?” led Davidson to explore the flaws in how companies typically manage diversity. They don't integrate diversity into their overall business strategy. They focus on differences that have little impact on their business. And often their diversity efforts end up hindering the professional development of the very people they were designed to help. Davidson explains how what he calls Leveraging Difference™ turns persistent diversity problems into solutions that drive business results. Difference becomes a powerful source of sustainable competitive advantage instead of a distracting mandate handed down from HR.To begin with, leaders must identify the differences most important to achieving organizational goals, even if the differences aren't the obvious ones. The second challenge is to help employees work together to understand the ways these differences matter to the business. Finally, leaders need to experiment with how to use these relevant differences to get things done. Davidson provides compelling examples of how organizations have tackled each of these challenges.Ultimately this is a book about leadership. As with any other strategic imperative, leaders need to take an active role—drive rather than just delegate. Successfully leveraging difference can be what distinguishes an ordinary organization from an extraordinary one.","tags":["Business","Human Resources","Workforce Diversity"]},{"id":"9781118602812","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Weak Signals for Strategic Intelligence: Anticipation Tool for Managers","authors":["Humbert Lesca","Nicolas Lesca"],"pages":"230","publication_date":"October 2011","description":"The expression \"We did not see it coming!\" has often been heard in recent years from decision makers at the highest levels of the private and public sectors.

Countless business authors and analysts have assured us that great leadership demands great character. Time and again, we’ve seen that truth play out, as once-thriving organizations falter and fail under the guidance of leaders behaving badly. Why, then, do so many executives remain skeptical about the true value of leadership character? A winning strategy and a sound business model are what really matter, they argue; character is just the icing on the cake.What’s been missing from this debate is hard evidence: data that shows not only that leadership character matters for organizational success, but how it matters; and concrete evidence that it leads to better business results. Now, in this groundbreaking book, respected leadership researcher, adviser, and author Fred Kiel offers that evidencesolid data that demonstrates the connection between character, leadership excellence, and organizational results.After seven years of rigorous research based on a landmark study of more than 100 CEOs and over 8,000 of their employees’ observations, Kiel’s findings show that leaders of strong character achieved up to five times the ROA for their organizations as did leaders of weak character.Return on Character goes on to reveal: How leadership character is formed, how it creates value, and how that value spreads throughout the organization How low-character leaders undermine the success of even the best business plans How leaders at any level can develop the habits of strong character and unlearn” the habits of poor characterThe book also provides a character-building methodologystep-by-step advice and techniques for assessing your own character habits and improving your performance and that of your organization.Return on Character provides the blueprint for building your own leadership character and creating a character-driven organization that achieves superior business results.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781000366587","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Gear-Shifting Leadership","authors":["Leon Cai"],"pages":"200","publication_date":"March 2021","description":"Drawn from his experience as the executive dean of Wilner Sales and Leadership Institute, Leon Cai shares his proven philosophy and methods for improving leadership skills among middle and high-level managers.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781259582967","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Innovation the Cleveland Clinic Way: Powering Transformation by Putting Ideas to Work","authors":["Thomas Graham"],"pages":"288","publication_date":"January 2016","description":"Unlock the secret to groundbreaking innovation with this game-changing guide\n\nInnovation means putting ideas to work.

More and more companies around the world are eager to do business in India. This book details the challenges and risks involved as well as providing real suggestions for overcoming them. It begins by providing a background to understanding India and highlights the business environment in which the economic, legal, and cultural variances exist. Potential markets are then discussed, focusing on the sectors, regions, and cities where growth is taking place; the upper, middle, and lower income segments; Indian MNEs; public sector and state-owned companies, and family-owned enterprises. Throughout the book, the author examines the various pitfalls and obstacles that are frequently encountered when operating in India, including political uncertainty and intransigence, corruption, bureaucratic roadblocks, the web of litigation, protecting intellectual property, labor and human resources limitations, and India’s ubiquitous second economy. These not only increase risk and lead to costly delays on account of lengthy litigation and payment of bribes, aggravating frustration, but may also result in total loss of investments. The book concludes by providing keys to success, including guidelines for selecting partners and appointing agents, as well as negotiating techniques that work in India. It also includes a comprehensive list of web resources for further exploration, and to connect with government and private sector bodies.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","International Business"]},{"id":"9781604913712","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Leadership in Action: Dividends and Interest - Connected Leadership: Fad or Useful Framework?","authors":["Craig Chappelow"],"pages":"3","publication_date":"April 2003","description":"\"New\" management movements have been creating a buzz in the human resource field as far back as when it was still called personnel.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"53863MIT62422","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Fighting Backlash to Racial Equity Efforts","authors":["Rosalind M.

A lack of accountability, transparency, and ease of operating in China—combined with growing evidence of high-level corruption—has made domestic and foreign businesspeople increasingly wary of the “China model.” These issues have deep roots in Chinese history and the country’s political system.Regina M. Abrami of the Wharton School and William C. Kirby and F. Warren McFarlan of Harvard Business School contend that the country’s dynamic private sector could be a source of sustainable growth, but it is constrained by political favoritism toward state-owned corporations. Disruptive innovation, research, and development are limited by concerns about intellectual property protection. Most significant of all is the question of China’s political future: does a system that has overseen dramatic transformations in recent years now have the capacity to transform itself?Based on a new and popular course taught by the authors at Harvard Business School, this book draws on more than thirty Harvard Business School case studies on Chinese and foreign companies doing business in the region, including Sealed Air, China Merchants Bank, China Mobile, Wanxiang Group, Microsoft, UFIDA, and others.Can China Lead? asserts that China is at an inflection point that cannot be ignored.

Or making the right investments. Or breaking down organizational silos. All of these things may help—but there’s only one way to ensure sustained innovation: you need to lead it—and with a special kind of leadership. Collective Genius shows you how. Preeminent leadership scholar Linda Hill, along with former Pixar tech wizard Greg Brandeau, MIT researcher Emily Truelove, and Being the Boss coauthor Kent Lineback, found among leaders a widely shared, and mistaken, assumption: that a “good” leader in all other respects would also be an effective leader of innovation. The truth is, leading innovation takes a distinctive kind of leadership, one that unleashes and harnesses the “collective genius” of the people in the organization.Using vivid stories of individual leaders at companies like Volkswagen, Google, eBay, and Pfizer, as well as nonprofits and international government agencies, the authors show how successful leaders of innovation don’t create a vision and try to make innovation happen themselves. Rather, they create and sustain a culture where innovation is allowed to happen again and again—an environment where people are both willing and able to do the hard work that innovative problem solving requires.Collective Genius will not only inspire you; it will give you the concrete, practical guidance you need to build innovation into the fabric of your business.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Innovation"]},{"id":"9781398603967","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Employment Law, 3rd Edition","authors":["Elizabeth Aylott"],"pages":"240","publication_date":"May 2022","description":"Gain a thorough grounding in the core principles and practices of UK employment law with the third edition of this practical guide from the HR Fundamentals series.","tags":["Business","Human Resources"]},{"id":"9780749483593","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Smarketing","authors":["Timothy Hughes","Adam Gray","Hugo Whicher"],"pages":"248","publication_date":"October 2018","description":"Understand the concept of 'Smarketing' - the merging of sales and marketing departments to break down organizational silos - to achieve stronger, more streamlined business growth.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Marketing"]},{"id":"9781586445195","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Go Beyond the Job Description, 2nd Edition","authors":["Ashley Prisant"],"pages":"224","publication_date":"June 2018","description":"Learn how to unlock hidden employee potential and boost engagement with a practical 100-day talent strategy.","tags":["Business","Human Resources","Finding Talent"]},{"id":"9781398605947","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Develop Your Presentation Skills, 5th Edition","authors":["Theo Theobald"],"pages":"184","publication_date":"July 2022","description":"Gain essential skills on delivering presentations with impact, improve your confidence and learn how to present remotely on screen.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Communication","Presentation Skills"]},{"id":"9781398608979","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Big Tech in Finance","authors":["Igor Pejic"],"pages":"296","publication_date":"May 2023","description":"Understand the ramifications caused by Big Tech's disruption into finance and ensure your organization will profit from blockchain rather than being disrupted by it.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance"]},{"id":"9781789664638","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Career Fear (and how to beat it)","authors":["Somi Arian"],"pages":"208","publication_date":"August 2020","description":"Futureproof your skills and take control of your career path with this smart and practical guide to surviving and thriving in an era of disruption.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Career Development"]},{"id":"9781789666977","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Nine Types of Leader","authors":["James Ashton"],"pages":"288","publication_date":"January 2021","description":"Through candid interviews and encounters with some of the world's most successful business people, find out what makes great leaders tick, learn what it takes to be credible and read about the things that they'd do differently if they had to do it all again.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781398608443","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"High-Impact Content Marketing","authors":["Purna Virji"],"pages":"352","publication_date":"July 2023","description":"Increase engagement, brand reach and conversion rates by implementing a streamlined and inclusive content marketing strategy that successfully cuts through the noise.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Marketing","Content Marketing"]},{"id":"53863MIT63413","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Politics in the Workplace: How Can Managers Keep the Peace?","authors":["Lemaro Thompson"],"pages":"6","publication_date":"March 2022","description":"When political discussions enter the workplace, partisan disagreements can lead to a range of issues, including stereotyping, bias, discrimination, and animosity among coworkers.

But many executives who have tried to implement ABC on a large scale in their organizations have found the approach limiting and frustrating. Why? The employee surveys that companies used to estimate resources required for business activities proved too time-consuming, expensive, and irritating to employees.This book shows you how to implement time-driven activity-based costing (TDABC), an easier and more powerful way to implement ABC. You can now estimate directly the resource demands imposed by each business transaction, product, or customer. The payoff? You spend less time and money obtaining and maintaining TDABC dataand more time addressing problems that TDABC reveals, such as inefficient processes, unprofitable products and customers, and excess capacity. The authors also show how to use TDABC to link strategic planning to operational budgeting, to enhance the due diligence process for mergers and acquisitions, and to support continuous improvement activities such as lean management and benchmarking.In presenting their model, the authors define the two questions required to build TDABC:1) How much does it cost per time unit to supply resource capacity for each business process?2) How much resource capacity (time) is required to perform work for a company’s many transactions, products, and customers?The book demonstrates how to develop simple, valid answers to these two questions.Kaplan and Anderson illustrate the TDABC approach with a wealth of case studies, in diverse settings, based on actual implementations.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy"]},{"id":"9783110985160","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"An Anatomy of Tax Havens","authors":["Paul R.

This book details the Just-in-Time (JIT) quality management strategy, exploring the cutting edge of a new management technology principle that surpasses what traditional JIT has accomplished. The new JIT principle contains hardware and software systems, and next-generation technical principles for transforming management technology into management strategy. This comprehensive work covers traditional JIT, innovation and evolution, the full new JIT and its applications, along with case studies. It is clearly impossible to lead the next generation by merely maintaining the two Toyota management technology principles, Toyota Production System and Total Quality Management. To overcome this issue, it is essential to renovate not only TPS, which is the core principle of the production process, but also establish core principles for marketing, design and development, production, and other departments. This book reassesses the way management technology was carried out in the manufacturing industry and establishes new JIT. This next-generation management technology model is the JIT system for not only manufacturing, but also for customer relations, sales and marketing, product planning, research and development (R&D), product design, production engineering, logistics, procurement, and administration and management for enhancing business process innovation and introduction of new concepts and procedures.The book focuses on the theory and application of strategic management technology through the application of new JIT, then demonstrates its effectiveness in a case study based on an advanced car manufacturer. Using this new model, you can realize manufacturing that places top priority on customers with a good Quality, Cost, and Delivery (QCD) in a rapidly changing technical environment, and allows you to create uniform quality for the global market.","tags":["Business","Project & Product Management","Project Management","JIRA"]},{"id":"0131477722","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Rise of the Rogue Executive: How Good Companies Go Bad and How to Stop the Destruction","authors":["Leonard R.

Executives continue to plunder their companies and rip off their stockholders. This book reveals the true breadth and depth of corporate corruption—including flagrant new cases that haven't received the publicity they deserve. More important, it answers the questions that matter most: Why now? And how can we stop it? The authors identify powerful forces that cut across management, finance, the economy, politics, and even psychology. They identify rarely discussed contributing factors, such as the consulting boom, new technologies used by accounting and auditing professionals, the transformation of business schools, journalism, and the media in general. This book addresses both criminal activity and the not-quite-illegal abuses that are now endemic in the executive suite—abuses that challenge the underpinnings of capitalism.

The justification for CSR is therefore associated with representing the nature and role of the company, as well as its purpose. Companies therefore regard CSR as a strategic investment that is part of a proactive, resilient, inclusive approach, based on the creation of shared value. This approach is capable of reducing negative societal impacts of their activities, or inducing positive impacts if they sustain a hybrid culture, all the while improving their competitive advantage. This book presents a theoretical development that analyzes the challenges of CSR strategies based on the creation of shared value.

Stalled growth is the rule, not the exception--even for the best-managed companies. That's especially true in unpredictable economic environments such as the one we're experiencing today.\n\nMcKee has a unique understanding of what happens when growth stalls. His firm commissioned a study of 700 companies that had at one time been among the nation's fastest-growing businesses. Developed in concert with Decision Analyst, a leading national research and consulting firm, the study probed areas as diverse as corporate structure, competition, branding, finance, and strategy. The target respondent profile were CEOs, owners, principals, presidents, managing directors or chairmen of the board. In-depth follow-up interviews yielded fascinating stories and personal comments from executives who had been living on the front lines of real-life growth crises. McKee presents compelling knowledge about how and why companies lose their way, and offers practical advice about how they can rekindle growth.\n\nWhen Growth Stalls demonstrates that sluggish growth is generally produced not by mismanagement or strategic blundering but by natural market forces and management dynamics that are often unrecognized--and widespread. The book presents seven characteristics that commonly correlate with stalled growth and what to do about them. Some are external forces to which countless companies have fallen victim: economic upheavals, changing industry dynamics, and increased competition. What McKee points out, however, is how often they catch companies off-guard. More surprising are four subtle and highly destructive internal factors that conspire to keep companies down: lack of consensus among the management team, loss of nerve, loss of focus, and marketing inconsistency. McKee makes the case that, regardless of what's going on outside of an enterprise, it's what's inside that counts.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy"]},{"id":"9780470637982","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Management Reset: Organizing for Sustainable Effectiveness","authors":["Edward E.

Providing a practical framework for improving acquisition processes, CMMI-ACQ addresses the growing trend in business and government for organizations to purchase or outsource required products and services as an alternative to in-house development or resource allocation.\n\nChanges in CMMI-ACQ version 1.3 include improvements to high maturity process areas, improvements to the model architecture to simplify use of multiple models, and added guidance about using preferred suppliers.\n\nCMMI® for Acquisition, Second Edition, is the definitive reference for CMMI-ACQ version 1.3. In addition to the entire revised CMMI-ACQ model, the book includes updated tips, hints, cross-references, and other author notes to help you understand, apply, and quickly find information about the content of the acquisition process areas. The book now includes more than a dozen contributed essays to help guide the adoption and use of CMMI-ACQ in industry and government. Whether you are new to CMMI models or are already familiar with one or more of them, you will find this book an essential resource for managing your acquisition processes and improving your overall performance.\n\nThe book is divided into three parts.\n\nPart One introduces CMMI-ACQ in the broad context of CMMI models, including essential concepts and useful background. It then describes and shows the relationships among all the components of the CMMI-ACQ process areas, and explains paths to the adoption and use of the model for process improvement and benchmarking. Several original essays share insights and real experiences with CMMI-ACQ in both industry and government environments.\n\nPart Two first describes generic goals and generic practices, and then details the twenty-two CMMI-ACQ process areas, including specific goals, specific practices, and examples for each. These process areas are organized alphabetically and tabbed by process area acronym to facilitate quick reference.\n\nPart Three provides several useful resources, including sources of further information about CMMI and CMMI-ACQ, acronym definitions, a glossary of terms, and an index.","tags":["Business","Project & Product Management","Product Management","Measuring IT / Software","Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI)"]},{"id":"9781947308671","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"A Practical Guide to Managing Temporary Workers","authors":["Peter R.

No longer is it assumed that everyone who works for you will be on your company’s payroll.\n\nAlongside your regular employees might be temps, freelancers, and independent contractors, all offering a more cost effective and efficient model to address your human resource needs. At the same time, these arrangements can meet the needs of workers by giving them income, experience, skills, a work record, or perhaps just the flexibility to work when and where they want.\n\nUtilizing a mix of regular and contingent workers, or even outsourcing the entire workforce, is one way to help reduce these costs and has become a more attractive employment model for many organizations. A Practical Guide to Managing Temporary Workers takes you inside this process. The use of contingent workers has burgeoned, especially since the Great Recession, and the businesses providing access to such workers have become increasingly numerous and sophisticated.\n\nFrom developing a strategy and guidelines around contingent workers to training and treating them fairly, this book helps you gain a better understanding of the possible impact of these workers on your organization’s future and how you can manage them more effectively.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Team Management"]},{"id":"9780132475877","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Coming China Trade and Economic Wars: How to Fight and Win Them","authors":["Peter Navarro"],"pages":"10","publication_date":"February 2010","description":"This Element is an excerpt from The Coming China Wars: Where They Will Be Fought and How They Can Be Won (ISBN: 9780132359825) by Peter Navarro. Available in print and digital formats.\n\nHow to win the inevitable, fast-arriving economic war with China: What consumers, businesses, and governments must start doing today.\n\nBecause of the “zero-sum” economic consequences and environmental fallout from China’s export-driven growth, the citizens of America, Europe, and other countries ultimately pay dearly for cheap Chinese goods--with lost jobs, stagnant wages, skyrocketing energy prices, unsafe products, lost sovereignty, and more pollution and global warming.

Palm Programming should be eagerly accepted by programmers because the authors worked closely with Palm to ensure that the book is tailored exactly to the needs of the ever-growing group of Palm developers. As nothing but some piecemeal documentation exists currently, this book provides a much needed solution to the Palm developers. In fact, Palm uses this book as their official developer's guide and will be using it in the future as a key part of their training materials for developers. There are currently no books on Palm programming (and we know of none that are planned). The only way to learn is by using the reference material published by Palm (available freely on their Web site), the tutorial they provide, or various Palm programming FAQs compiled by third parties. Palm Programming shows intermediate to experienced C programmers how to build a Palm application from the ground up. Using an easy-to- understand tutorial approach, this book gives readers everything necessary to create a wide range of Palm applications and conduits, from simple scripts through full-blown applications, and in the process provides thorough coverage of Palm programming.

Bill Priest, Steve Bleiberg and Mike Welhoelter all experienced investment professionals, consider the challenges of managing portfolios through complex markets, as well as managing the cultural and technological complexities of the investment business.\n\nThe book’s initial section highlights the importance of culture within an investment firm – the characteristics of strong cultures, the imperatives of communication and support, and suggestions for leading firms through times of both adversity and prosperity.\n\nIt continues with a thorough discussion of active portfolio management for equities. The ongoing debate over active versus passive management is reviewed in detail, drawing on both financial theory and real-world investing results. The book also contrasts traditional methods of portfolio management, based on accounting metrics and price-earnings ratios, with Epoch Investment Partners’ philosophy of investing on free cash flow and appropriate capital allocation.\n\nWinning at Active Management closes with an inquiry into the crucial and growing role of technology in investing. The authors assert that the most effective portfolio strategies result from neither pure fundamental nor quantitative methods, but instead from thoughtful combinations of analyst and portfolio manager experience and skill with the speed and breadth of quantitative analysis. The authors illustrate the point with an example of an innovative Epoch equity strategy based on economic logic and judgment, but enabled by information technology.\n\nWinning at Active Management also offers important insights into selecting active managers – the market cycle factors that have held back many managers’ performance in recent years, and the difficulty of identifying those firms that truly possess investment skill. Drawing on behavioral economic theory and empirical research, the book makes a convincing case that many active investment managers can and do generate returns superior to those of the broad market.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Personal Finance"]},{"id":"9781523096084","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Performance Budgeting","authors":["William G.

In particular, it examines the difficulties and obstacles affecting the technological collaboration between Chinese firms and foreign partners as well as some of the key organizational and institutional challenges of innovation facing Chinese firms.Despite enjoying rapid economic growth in previous decades, learning and innovation of Chinese firms has received relatively limited attention among management and international business scholars in the past. However, some significant changes in the Chinese institutional environment have occurred in recent years. On one hand, the Chinese central government has devised a number of policy initiatives to promote and support innovative activities in China, ranging from the ‘Mass Entrepreneurship and Innovation by All’ to the latest ‘Made in China 2025’. On the other hand, we have witnessed an increasing number of indigenous Chinese firms (e.g. Alibaba, Baidu, Tencent, Huawei and DJI) adopting business model innovation with global inputs and impacts in different business sectors, namely electronic commerce, telecommunication network equipment, social media, mobile payment and drones.In view of these recent developments, we aim to further our understanding about the learning and innovation processes of Chinese firms in this edited volume.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Innovation"]},{"id":"9781119653097","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Adaptation Advantage","authors":["Heather E.

Friedman"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"April 2020","description":"A guide for individuals and organizations navigating the complex and ambiguous Future of Work\n\nForeword by New York Times columnist and best-selling author Thomas L. Friedman\n\nTechnology is changing work as we know it. Cultural norms are undergoing tectonic shifts. A global pandemic proves that we are inextricably connected whether we choose to be or not. So much change, so quickly, is disorienting. It's undermining our sense of identity and challenging our ability to adapt. But where so many see these changes as threatening, Heather McGowan and Chris Shipley see the opportunity to open the flood gates of human potential—if we can change the way we think about work and leadership. They have dedicated the last 5 years to understanding how technical, business, and cultural shifts affecting the workplace have brought us to this crossroads, The result is a powerful and practical guide to the future of work for leaders and employees. The future can be better, but only if we let go of our attachment to our traditional (and disappearing) ideas about careers, and what a \"good job\" looks like.\n\nBlending wisdom from interviews with hundreds of executives, The Adaptation Advantage explains the profound changes happening in the world of work and posits the solution: new ways to think about careers that detach our sense of pride and personal identity from our job title, and connect it to our sense of purpose. Activating purpose, the authors suggest, will inherently motivate learning, engagement, empowerment, and lead to new forms of pride and identity throughout the workforce. Only when we let go of our rigid career identities can we embrace and appreciate the joys of learning and adapting to new realities—and help our organizations do the same.\n\nOf course, making this transition is hard. It requires leaders who can attract and motivate cognitively diverse teams fueled by a strong sense of purpose in an environment of psychological safety—despite fierce competition and external pressures.   Adapting to the future of work has always called for strong leadership. Now, as a pandemic disrupts so many aspects of work, adapting is a leadership imperative. The Adaptation Advantage is an essential guide to help leaders meet that challenge.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781492053859","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Future of the Firm","authors":["Josh Bersin","Tim O'Reilly","Roger Magoulas"],"pages":"31","publication_date":"March 2019","description":"Today’s successful businesses are increasingly digital and technologically astute, but how do they attract and manage employees in a world where two billion people work part-time?

Although we now have ample insight into how customers evaluate new products, many companies focus primarily on creating value -- without enough regard to how customers recognize innovations and evaluate new products.\n\nThere are only two ways consumers can collect information, the author notes: They can search, or they can infer. Knowing when consumers will search or infer will help you determine which of your innovations customers will recognize.\n\nThe Internet has had a profound impact on the way customers evaluate many products. First, it has lowered the cost of search by making information more accessible. Second, the Internet has broadened what is searchable by including customer reviews as well as product features on standard spec sheets.\n\nTo ensure that customers will recognize the value your products offer, the author recommends focusing on three questions: Are customers motivated to search? Are they able to search effectively? What cues will customers use to infer value?","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Sales","Customer Success"]},{"id":"53863MIT54414","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Navigating the Politics and Emotions of Change","authors":["Trish Ruebottom","Ellen R.

Yet many change initiatives fail. One reason, the authors say, is that leaders often underestimate the impact of the politics and emotions of change. The authors suggest a five-step process for leading a major change initiative:Step 1: Map the political landscape. Map the key external and internal, formal and informal stakeholders who will be affected by the change.Step 2: Identify the key influencers within each stakeholder group. Once the key stakeholder groups are mapped, leaders should identify the key influencers within each group. Key influencers are those individuals who might be able to marshal resources, enroll others, build legitimacy and momentum, and provide ideas crucial to driving the change.Step 3: Assess influencers’ receptiveness to change. People have different levels of receptiveness to a given change. Both supporters and skeptics must be engaged.Step 4: Mobilize influential sponsors and promoters. Sponsors have access to financial and human resources. Promoters, on the other hand, can be extremely useful in igniting the enthusiasm that can draw fence-sitters into the process and propel change forward.Step 5: Engage influential positive and negative skeptics. Skeptics can either make a change process more effective or turn a minor hurdle into a major roadblock. Positive skeptics may offer important perspectives and insights about the vulnerabilities of proposed changes. Influential negative skeptics are also important to work with.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Strategic Thinking"]},{"id":"9781604913354","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Leadership in Action: Dividends and Interest - Malaysia's Financial Sector is Banking on Women","authors":["Michael Jenkins"],"pages":"2","publication_date":"December 2005","description":"The most important leadership quality is to have the trust of those you lead.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Banking"]},{"id":"53863MIT67210","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Decode Competing Signals to Act Strategically","authors":["Rahul Bhandari"],"pages":"6","publication_date":"September 2025","description":"Most executives assume that if they plan thoroughly, a strategic path will reveal itself.

The payoffs can take many years to materialize or may never come. Even though the traditional venture capital/entrepreneurial model has been shown to stimulate innovation in a wide range of technology settings (software, computers, Internet, electronics, etc.), it wasn't designed to deal with the costs, risks, and slow payout of science-based industries. Although venture capital continues to flow into industries like biotechnology, there has been a significant shift away from funding ventures at the earliest stages. A key concern is that lack of availability of future rounds of financing can shut off the flow of venture capital funding abruptly.\n\nIn this article, authors Andrew W. Lo and Gary P. Pisano draw on comparisons to projects in the moviemaking industry and propose the project-focused organization (PFO) as an alternative structure for undertaking long-term, high-risk, highly capital-intensive R&D programs in science-based industries such as biotech. PFOs are entities created to conduct a specific R&D project. The authors discuss how they could work in practice, using the example of biopharmaceutical R&D.\n\nResearchers innovating in a science-based context must overcome two specific challenges. First, they need to raise sufficient capital to fund a long-term, highly risky, and very expensive project. Second, they must have a governance mechanism for allocating capital (human and financial) and conducting projects. The authors propose that governance centered on the project rather than the company may be a more efficient way to organize innovation in science-based industries. To reduce overhead, they propose contracting out for resources as necessary. As with movie projects, investors could choose projects they want to invest in, with the understanding that they will receive returns only if those projects succeed.\n\nAlthough the authors write that organizing innovation through PFOs has benefits for investors and companies, they say that one size doesn't fit all when it comes to organizing innovation and that many models need to be explored. The article also contains commentaries on Lo and Pisano's ideas by Phillip Sharp of MIT's Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, Noubar Afeyan of Flagship Ventures, Mark E. Davis of the California Institute of Technology, and Josh Lerner of Harvard Business School.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Innovation"]},{"id":"53863MIT65214","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Five Ways Leaders Can Turn Pushback Into Progress","authors":["Phillip G.

The first chapters begin with a review of those simple examples and the terminology used for waiting line processes. Readers are assumed to have basic familiarity with the use of probability distributions and Excel analysis tools. Those readers wishing to refresh their knowledge are provided references for doing so. Following chapters cover more complex concepts related to multiple server situations, less common arrival and service distributions, limited population applications commonly used for maintenance activities, cost trade-offs between adding service capacity versus process improvements, and manufacturing applications. The final chapters deal with the important topic that waiting line theory only predicts average performance, not the variability around that average. To gain knowledge about variability for evaluation of best and worst-case scenarios, the use of simulation is required. Readers are introduced to how simulation using Excel tools can be set up for several waiting situations. Sample programs are provided that can be modified to address particular situations.","tags":["Business","Operations"]},{"id":"9781933115030","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Environmental Protection and the Social Responsibility of Firms","authors":["Bruce Professor Hay","Robert Professor Stavins","Richard Professor Vietor"],"pages":"224","publication_date":"September 2010","description":"Everyone agrees that firms should obey the law. But beyond what the law requires-beyond bare compliance with regulations-do firms have additional social responsibilities to commit resources voluntarily to environmental protection? How should we think about firms sacrificing profits in the social interest? Are they permitted to do so, given their fiduciary responsibilities to their shareholders? Even if permissible, is the practice sustainable, or will the competitive marketplace render such efforts and their impacts transient at best? Furthermore, is the practice, however well intended, an efficient use of social and economic resources? And, as an empirical matter, to what extent do firms already behave this way? Until now, public discussion has generated more heat than light on both the normative and positive questions surrounding corporate social responsibility (CSR) in the environmental realm. In Environmental Protection and the Social Responsibility of Firms, some of the nation‘s leading scholars in law, economics, and business examine commonly accepted assumptions at the heart of current debates on corporate social responsibility and provide a foundation for future research and policymaking.","tags":["Business","Operations","Green Business Practices"]},{"id":"9781599961897","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Creating Organizational Soul: The Source of Positive Change and Transformation","authors":["Richard Bellingham Ed.D."],"pages":"141","publication_date":"January 2009","description":"Does your organization have soul?

Millions of workers, even those who have carefully chosen careers based on true passions and interests, dread going to work, suffering each day as they trudge to jobs that make them cynical, weary, and frustrated. It is a simple fact of business life that any job, from investment banker to dishwasher, can become miserable.

In addition to the fable, the book includes a detailed model examining the three signs of job misery and how they can be remedied.

In fact, one survey found that while 80 percent of companies described themselves as delivering “superior” service, consumers estimated the number at a mere 8 percent. The problem, according to service expert Steve Curtin, is actually quite simple. When asked what their work entails, most employees list the duties and tasks associated with their position. Very few refer to the true essence of their job, which should be their highest priority—to create delighted customers who will be less price sensitive, have higher repurchase rates, and enthusiastically recommend the company or brand to others. Without this customer focus, all that exists is a transaction—and transactional service does not make a lasting positive impression or inspire loyalty. In Delight Your Customers, Curtin reveals three elements common to all exceptional service experiences. He also makes a compelling case that attention needs to shift from monitoring service activities to modeling, recognizing, and reinforcing the behaviors that actually create happy customers, such as expressing genuine interest, offering sincere compliments, sharing unique knowledge, conveying authentic enthusiasm, providing pleasant surprises, and delivering service heroics when needed. Illustrated with real-world stories and examples, this refreshing guide helps readers everywhere take their customer service from ordinary to extraordinary.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Sales","Customer Service"]},{"id":"9780874254495","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Manager's Pocket Guide to Effective Meetings","authors":["Steve Kaye Ph.D."],"pages":"188","publication_date":"January 1998","description":"A very practical and informative title from the Managers Pocket Guide series.

However, most businesspeople are not ready to make informed decisions about software initiatives. The Economics of Iterative Software Development: Steering Toward Better Business Results will prepare them. Drawing on decades of software development and business experience, the authors demonstrate how to utilize practical, economics-based techniques to plan and manage software projects for maximum return on technology investments.\n\nThe authors begin by dispelling widespread myths about software costs, explaining why traditional, “engineering-based” software management introduces unacceptable inefficiencies in today’s development environments. Next, they show business and technical managers how to combine the principles of economics and iterative development to achieve optimal results with limited resources. Using their techniques, readers will learn how to build systems that enable maximum business innovation and process improvement–and implement software processes that allow them to do so consistently.\n\nHighlights include\n\nHow to repeatedly quantify the value a project is delivering and quickly adjust course as needed\n\nHow to reduce software project size, complexity, and other “project killers”\n\nHow to identify and eliminate software development processes that don’t work\n\nHow to improve development processes, reduce rework, mitigate risk, and identify inefficiencies\n\nHow to create more proficient teams by improving individual skills, team interactions, and organizational capability\n\nWhere to use integrated, automated tools to improve effectiveness\n\nWhat to measure, and when: specific metrics for project inception, elaboration, construction, and transition\n\nThe Economics of Iterative Software Development: Steering Toward Better Business Results will help both business and technical managers make better decisions throughout the software development process–and it will help team and project leaders keep any project or initiative on track, so they can deliver more value faster.","tags":["Business","Project & Product Management","Project Management","Software Estimation"]},{"id":"9780137059522","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Recruiting Your Own Dream Team: Relationships Built to Last Lead to Success Built to Last","authors":["Jerry Porras","Stewart Emery","Mark Thompson"],"pages":"6","publication_date":"February 2010","description":"This Element is an excerpt from Success Built to Last: Creating a Life that Matters (ISBN: 9780132287517) by Jerry Porras, Stewart Emery, and Mark Thompson. Available in print and digital formats.\n\nCreate relationships that are “built to last”: relationships that will make you more effective for a lifetime, whatever your role, job, or goals.\n\nWould your behavior with others change if you knew in advance that your relationships would be long lasting?

The Net Promoter System shines as their guiding star.\n\nFew management ideas have spread so far and wide as the Net Promoter System (NPS). Since its conception almost two decades ago by customer loyalty guru Fred Reichheld, thousands of companies around the world have adopted it—from industrial titans such as Mercedes-Benz and Cummins to tech giants like Apple and Amazon to digital innovators such as Warby Parker and Peloton.\n\nNow, Reichheld has raised the bar yet again. In Winning on Purpose, he demonstrates that the primary purpose of a business should be to enrich the lives of its customers. Why? Because when customers feel this love, they come back for more and bring their friends—generating good profits. This is NPS 3.0 and it puts a new take on the age-old Golden Rule—treat customers the way you would want a loved one treated—at the heart of enduring business success.

This will require workers to acquire new sources of bargaining power and for business, labor, government, and educators to work together to meet the challenges and opportunities facing the next generation workforce. The book reviews what worked well for average workers, families, and the economy during the era of the post-World War II Social Contract, why that contract broke down, and how, working together, we can build a new social contract suitable to today's economy and workforce. The ideas presented here come from direct engagement with next generation workers who participated in a MIT online course devoted to the future of work and from the author's 40 years of research and active involvement with business, government, and labor leaders over how to foster innovations in workplace practices and policies.","tags":["Business","Economics"]},{"id":"9781547400508","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Sustainability","authors":["Gilbert S.

Harmonisation began to be looked at as an attempt by one legal system to impose its values on the other. A major reason for that is the lack of understanding of the scope to which these two legal traditions converge. One of the principal findings of this book is that Shari’ah and common law have many more commonalities than differences. As a result, the need for harmonisation between the two might have been exaggerated. The similarities do not need to be harmonised. Rather, they need to be acknowledged and appreciated. If the differences between Shari’ah and common law, which undoubtedly exist as evidenced in this book, are approached from the position of appreciation for commonalities, the ambiance to reconcile the differences would be more conducive to the harmonisation process which would, in that case, be reflective of compromise. This book is intended to help readers better understand Shari’ah and common law and aid harmonization efforts when needed.","tags":["Business","Business Law"]},{"id":"9780132312479","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Encourage Unconventional Thinking","authors":["James F.

Worley","Thomas Williams","Edward E. Lawler III"],"pages":"6","publication_date":"October 2016","description":"The word “agility” has entered the business lexicon like few other terms in recent memory. Yet according to the authors, the core concept is misunderstood. An essential feature is repeatability, which requires management processes that can support adaptability over time.\n\nThe authors studied data from the largest public global companies in 22 industries between 1980 and 2012 and surveyed more than 50 companies in an effort to understand the factors that explained sustained levels of high performance. The authors concluded that organizational agility required routines in four areas: strategizing, perceiving, testing, and implementing.\n\nRoutines and capabilities, the authors note, allow organizations to perform key activities reliably and repeatedly. Management processes -- the fundamentals of planning, organizing, controlling, and motivating -- operationalize the routines and capabilities. To support agility, management processes need to be designed well, and some processes must be designed for change.\n\nWhile the authors found that good management processes were a prerequisite for agility, good processes were no guarantee for success. Sustaining high performance was a function of whether certain processes were flexible and fast. They illustrate their argument using two companies from their research: the Brioche Pasquier Group, a multinational bakery headquartered in Les Cerqueux, France, and Netflix Inc., which is based in Los Gatos, California, and streams digital content to more than 80 million customers in more than 190 countries.\n\nBoth companies demonstrated an ability to operate effectively without being tied to a rigid set of steps. At Brioche Pasquier Group, for example, twice a year individuals and teams identify objectives and actions related to their work that they think can improve short-term performance or develop future capability, and they also review the previous plans. Brioche Pasquier Group uses this as an opportunity to distribute monetary bonuses (funded by savings or new value realized) to the individuals and teams whose actions contributed to the results. At Netflix, executives are committed to putting information into the hands of the people who do the work and making sure that the information flows up and down to everyone who needs it.\n\n“Flexibility requires having a clear understanding of what the management process is supposed to achieve, functional links to a portfolio of inputs, and the freedom to adapt the process as necessary,” the authors write. “While the purpose of the process must be well established and widely shared, the information needed by the process and the means to the ends shouldn’t be fixed or narrow.”","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Change Management"]},{"id":"9781604912456","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Leadership in Action: Thinking Straight: New Strategies Are Needed for Ethical Leadership","authors":["Richard T.

Kochan argues, are managed for the long term, seeking to compete through a combination of high productivity, innovation, and quality customer service that both requires and supports high wages and good job and career opportunities for employees. “Low-road” companies, by contrast, seek profits and shareholder returns by minimizing costs and controlling labor in ways that keep wages low for most employees and/or contractors.\n\nA prototypical high-road company the author cites is Southwest Airlines Co., which has been the most profitable airline in the U.S. over the past 30 years and has also often been rated as one of the best places in the U.S. to work. Also mentioned is Market Basket, a family-owned grocery store chain headquartered in Tewksbury, Massachusetts. In the summer of 2014, Market Basket’s legacy of low prices, good customer service, and good-quality jobs was highlighted when a family feud broke out among members of its board of directors and the family member who had been serving as CEO and was popular among employees was fired. After a six-week “strike” by nonunion employees and managers that had broad community and media support (it caused an astounding 92% reduction in the company’s revenues), the board agreed to sell the business to the ousted CEO, whose reinstatement employees had sought.\n\nStandard economics argues that the higher labor costs are as a proportion of total costs, the more important it is to control these costs. However, the author explains, high-road companies take another view, relying heavily on practices including screening employees for their strong technical, problem-solving, and collaborative skills; investment in training and development of the full workforce; compensation systems that align employee and company interests through profit sharing and/or payment for attaining higher levels of skills; and labor–management partnerships.\n\nDespite the effectiveness of high-road practices and their attractiveness to young employees, they are not widely followed by managers. “Few MBAs learn about high-road strategies in their economics, finance, and operations courses,” the author writes. “They don’t learn that, as business leaders, they will have distinct choices to make about how to compete.” He argues that academics, business and labor leaders, and employees themselves need to educate current and next-generation business leaders about the choices before them.","tags":["Business","Economics","Next Economy"]},{"id":"9781604911916","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Leadership in Action: In Focus - Youth Leadership - Stepping in Early to Grow great Leaders","authors":["Alan E.

Not because companies are pursuing the wrong goals — but because they are going about them the wrong way. Never before have companies been more conscious of the need to run their businesses in an environmentally, socially, and economically responsible fashion. Yet never before have theory and practice been wider apart. When it comes to practicing and not just preaching sustainability, many companies struggle and most flounder in developing and implementing a sustainable business model. Many executives know and feel the importance of making their businesses sustainable. But many of them can't make the transformation occur. Worse still, many don't even know they're failing. Based on their experience and observations, the authors identify key roadblocks to embedding sustainable business models and offer a roadmap to circumvent them.\n\nAccording to the authors, companies need to recognize that sustainability is not just another change initiative. Change-management initiatives are usually driven by some external factors or by lack of internal performance and are typically directed at increasing profitability and shareholder value. Sustainability, on the other hand, is about people and planet as well, not just profit. Sustainability involves creating value for all stakeholders in the ecosystem and viewing profits as a consequence of such value creation. Sustainability also requires a business to look at its entire value chain.\n\nA company's sustainability initiative, the authors argue, should be led by the CEO and should become a priority for the board. Business executives should also strive to attract the support of the company's middle management. In addition, sustainability must apply to the entire supply chain — and even beyond, to the usage and disposal of products. Because the details are so granular, this requires the attention, effort, and creative thinking of all employees and units.\n\nOf course, one company cannot solve the world's biggest problems all by itself. Companies need to form alliances with competitors in their sustainability journey. One example: The Consumer Goods Forum, representing top retailers and consumer-goods manufacturers, came together to work toward eliminating net deforestation in members' supply chains by sustainably sourcing the commodities that drive much deforestation: palm oil, beef, soy, and timber. That commitment was made possible by companies including Unilever, Procter & Gamble, Nestle, Coca-Cola, and PepsiCo agreeing on a plan.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Business Ethics"]},{"id":"53863MIT55417","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Protecting Intellectual Property in China","authors":["Mary Teagarden","Andreas Schotter"],"pages":"8","publication_date":"July 2014","description":"Intellectual property protection is the No. 1 challenge for multinational corporations operating in China. According to the U.S. government, China accounted for nearly 80% of all IP thefts from U.S.- headquartered organizations in 2013, causing an estimated $300 billion in lost business. For European manufacturers, the loss of IP in China reduced potential profits by 20%. The effects from IP leakage are visible in counterfeited items including toys, luxury goods and automotive and aircraft parts. But IP violations go beyond products. They extend to pirated operational processes and entire business and service models. For many multinational corporations, IP leakage becomes a barrier to integrating Chinese sites and partners into global innovation activities. IP leakage frequently occurs through staff transfers or shared practices from foreign multinational corporations to local joint ventures or supply chain partners. For multinationals, this type of IP leakage is often a calculated risk worth taking. However, unintended IP leakage can affect a company’s reputation and profitability. Even worse, it can create powerful local or even global competitors. To learn about how companies are managing the China IP protection challenge, authors Andreas Schotter and Mary Teagarden studied more than 50 multinational corporations. They identified nine IP protection practices that companies can use in China. Four of the practices are defensive and externally focused; the other five are proactive and internal. Together, these practices, which operate on the strategy, legal and business intelligence layers, create what the authors call the “IP protection web,” which allows corporations to (1) expand faster within China and across other emerging markets; (2) improve performance; and (3) enhance local and global innovativeness. According the authors, most of the companies they studied learned to protect their IP through trial and error — there is no single “best” process or practice. However, the changing composition of IP risk creates a need for ongoing reconfiguration. Indeed, as Chinese companies become more skillful at absorbing leaked IP from those employees who formerly worked for international rivals, international companies must develop more sophisticated responses and develop new ways to engender loyalty.","tags":["Business","Digital Economy","E-Commerce"]},{"id":"9781604912548","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Leadership in Action: In Focus—Responding to Change—Helping People Manage Transition","authors":["Kerry A.

Bardwick describes three basic mindsets and shows the effect of each on individuals and their organizations:\n\n* Entitlement -- people feel entitled to rewards and lethargic about having to earn them; motivation and job satisfaction are low* Fear -- people are paralyzed; the threat of layoffs makes them focus on protecting their jobs rather than doing them well* Earning -- people are energized by challenge; they know their accomplishments will be noticed -- and rewarded\n\nIn this paperback edition, Bardwick points out that although the \"fear\" element has undoubtedly grown in the last few years, the entitlement attitude is still firmly entrenched at all levels. She offers additional chapters with new, specific techniques for pulling people out of the quagmire of fear and complacency, and igniting them with the energy of true earning.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Development","Life-Work Balance"]},{"id":"9781118821411","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Agility Factor: Building Adaptable Organizations for Superior Performance","authors":["Christopher G.

Authors Christopher G. Worley, a senior research scientist, Thomas D. Williams, an executive advisor, and Edward E. Lawler III, one of the country's leading management experts, set out to find the answer. In The Agility Factor: Building Adaptable Organizations for Superior Performance the authors reveal the factors that drive long-term profitability based on the practices of successful companies that have consistently outperformed their peers. Of the 234 large companies across 18 industries that were studied, there were few companies that delivered sustained performance across the board. The authors found that across industries, the most successful companies were not the \"usual suspects\" found in the media, but companies who possessed a quiet agility that allowed them to quickly perceive and respond to changes so that they could continue to grow. Agility gives organizations the ability to adapt to fluctuations in the environment, test possible responses, and implement changes quickly. This book offers specific, research-based case studies to help organizational leaders use agility to achieve sustained profitability and performance while also becoming more adaptable to a changing marketplace.\n\nFor executives, leaders, consultants, board members and all those responsible for the long-term health of organizations, this insightful guide outlines:\n\nThe components of agility for business organizations\n\nHow to successfully build agility within an organization\n\nHow agility has its foundation in good management practices\n\nHow to use agility to gain a competitive advantage in the marketplace","tags":["Business","Human Resources","Talent Management"]},{"id":"9781118115718","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Innovative Team: Unleashing Creative Potential for Breakthrough Results","authors":["Chris Grivas","Gerard J.

Demographic trends in America, Europe, Russia, and Japan are reducing the pool of new workers. As the need for talent grows, China’s and India’s educational systems won’t be able to produce enough qualified graduates for themselves, let alone the rest of the world. But the heart of the problem is that the education-to-employment system worldwide is badly outmoded. We’re not producing graduates with the kinds of technical, communications, and thinking skills needed in the 21st century.In Winning the Global Talent Showdown, Ed Gordon surveys the sorry state of the world talent pipeline, with separate chapters on the Americas, Asia, and Europe. Each region faces its own challenges, yet the result is the same: a dramatic shortage of workers who can function in what Gordon calls our “cyber-mental” age.But this is fundamentally a book about solutions. Gordon argues that we need to completely reinvent our talent-creation system—and some pioneering efforts are already underway. He describes dozens of “gateways to the future,” innovative partnerships in which local governments, schools, businesses, labor unions, parents, training organizations, community activists, and others are collaborating to develop completely new approaches to education. Based on personal experience, Gordon outlines how concerned citizens can establish these partnerships in their own communities. And he looks down the road to 2020, explaining how we can build on the best of these new ideas so that the jobs pipeline flows freely again.","tags":["Business","Human Resources","Talent Management"]},{"id":"9781609949587","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Bridging the Values Gap","authors":["R. Edward Freeman","Ellen R. Auster"],"pages":"216","publication_date":"August 2015","description":"Bridging the Values Gap Business has a values problem. It's not just spectacular public scandals like Enron (which, incidentally, had a great corporate values statement). Many companies fail to live up to the standards they set for themselves, alienating the public and leaving employees cynical and disengaged—resulting in lower productivity, less innovation, and sometimes outright corruption. The reason, argue top scholars and consultants Edward Freeman and Ellen Auster, is that all too often values are handed down from on high, with little employee input, discussion, or connection to the challenges and opportunities facing the organization. Although the words may be well-intentioned, they aren't reflected in the everyday practices, policies, and processes of the organization. This practically invites disconnects between intention and reality. To bridge this gap between the “talk” and the “walk”, Freeman and Auster provide a process through which organizations can collectively surface deeply held values that truly resonate with everyone, from top to bottom. Their Values Through Conversation (VTC) process focuses on four key types of values conversations: introspective (reflecting on ourselves and how we do things in the organization), historical (exploring our understanding of our past and how it impacts us), connectedness (creating a strong community where we work well together), and aspirational (sharing our hopes and dreams). By developing values through discussions—casual or formal, one-on-one or in groups—VTC ensures that values are dynamic and evolving, not static words on a wall or a website. Freeman and Auster offer advice, real-world examples, and sample questions to help you create values that are authentic and embraced because they are rooted in the lived experience of the organization.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Business Ethics"]},{"id":"9780857094469","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Vertical Specialization and Trade Surplus in China","authors":["Wang Wei"],"pages":"204","publication_date":"May 2013","description":"The traditional flow of goods from primary production through to manufacturing and consumption has expanded across international borders conterminously with globalization. Vertical specialization (VS) in processing and manufacturing in China has driven export growth. In particular, intra-industry and intra-product trade between China, the US and East Asia has increased China’s trade surplus over the long term. Vertical Specialization and Trade Surplus in China aims to measure the level of VS in the Chinese manufacturing industry to provide a more accurate representation of China’s trade surplus, and gives empirical analysis on provinces and products with important VS activities in order to assess China’s trade value-added. Exploring the vertical division of labour, and foreign direct investment (FDI) driving China’s import and export imbalance, the book is divided into eight chapters, each covering an aspect of VS in China. The first chapter outlines the aims and method of the study. Chapter two covers VS trade pattern and trade surplus. Chapter three looks at FDI and the import and export imbalance, and chapter four covers the relationship between VS and import and export of foreign invested enterprises. The fifth chapter considers the causes and prospects for growth in China-US and China-Japan trade. Chapters six and seven give an empirical analysis of VS and trade surplus, and a breakdown of VS per industry in China’s provinces.

The operations function in a financial organization is crucial to the success of the business. It drives both profitability and reputation as well as contributing to business development and support. It is also a complex part of a business and one that is treated differently in different types of organizations. The complexity of operations and the diverseness of the teams and the people they interact with create a need for a high degree of relationship and resource management. For instance a bank that is involved in both retail and investment banking will have hundreds of different relationship situations, but so too will a small private client broker. Some situations may be common to all types of organizations; others common to particular types of organizations and a few will be very specific to an organization. These relationships may be very open or highly discreet and confidential. Whatever the type of relationship, whether problematic or successful, it is likely that any problems will have an impact of the business. For operations managers their role is a key one. Charged with managing resources and the numerous relationship issues, it is neither a simple task nor, because of the variety and frequency of the issues that might arise, one that is easy to find solutions for.

In this article, the authors explore two related trends: (1) the expansion of online-first retailers into offline stores that \"supercharge\" customer value and (2) the transformation of stores run by traditional, offline-first retailers from fulfillment-dominant centers into experience-dominant centers. As authors David R. Bell, Santiago Gallino, and Antonio Moreno note, as digitally native vertical brands have learned to build relationships with customers, traditional retailers have been reducing their store sizes and inventories and are attempting to improve and elevate the customer experience. \"Showroom experiences,\" they write, \"create better customers.\" When customers are exposed to the brand in a showroom, \"they are better able to resolve any uncertainty about the nondigital attributes of the retailer's product.\" Similarly, the authors say, \"showrooms create better retailers: When customers are physically present in the retail environment, observation of their behaviors can lead to meaningful insights.\"The authors developed their early insights into what customers value while working closely with Bonobos and Warby Parker. Through simulations, they saw that stores with smaller footprints and a higher level of service led to better results economically — improved margins, smoother logistics, and better control of inventory. They found that, rather than being dead, physical retail stores were very much alive with a profound shift in focus — from fulfillment to experience-oriented environments. The authors conclude that online-first retailers and traditional retailers have something to learn from each other. Offline-first retailers can benefit from copying the showroom concepts originated by online-first retailers; online-first retailers can benefit by opening more traditional stores.","tags":["Business","Digital Economy","E-Commerce"]},{"id":"0130461083","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Leading Strategic Change: Breaking Through the Brain Barrier","authors":["J.

Training Across Multiple Locations offers a comprehensive, proven model for designing, building and assessing every aspect of a multiple location training and development (T&D) system. Stephen Krempl and R. Wayne Pace detail how to integrate training from multiple locations into a comprehensive organizational strategy, and how corporate training can align those multiple locations with a single corporate vision.Training Across Multiple Locations draws from numerous real-life examples to show how distance learning technology-including intra-nets, web-based training, and computer-based training-is being used to manage multi-point training at companies like Motorola, Ford, Boeing, Kinko's, Hewlett-Packard, and others. With technology, the authors reveal, training organizations are able to extend their reach and distribute training over a far wider audience in ways that may make current approaches to training less relevant and even obsolete. And perhaps most importantly, they provide a model for calculating return on investment (ROI) for these technology-based programs.Krempl and Pace present a detailed review process for evaluating the effectiveness of multiple location training and development systems and provide specific advice on how to conduct the review and how to share data to enhance unit effectiveness. They also include a unique questionnaire that helps teams assess how well they are carrying out their T&D responsibilities and how well they are integrating their activities into the corporate business plan.Training and development functions survive by maintaining relationships with critical decision-makers at all levels in the organization. This process is often described in terms of politics and power-but Training Across Multiple Locations treats the issue simply in terms of how to get the job done. The unique process described in this book will encourage better preparation and more informed discussions and decisions, allowing managers to better anticipate problems and stay on top of key issues.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Business Architecture"]},{"id":"9780470647929","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Smarter, Faster, Cheaper: Non-Boring, Fluff-Free Strategies for Marketing and Promoting Your Business","authors":["David Siteman Garland"],"pages":"254","publication_date":"December 2010","description":"Save time and money in building, marketing and promoting your business\n\nWith huge recent shifts in the way enterprises are built, marketed, and monetized, these are \"wild west\" times for business.

The opportunity for business leaders clearly outlined in Living Supply Chains is to create real organizational alignment with your end markets, and in the process better comprehend the role leadership and people play in making supply chain an integral part of a High-Performance business.\" Jeffrey Russell, Managing Partner, Supply Chain Asia Pacific, Accenture The challenge of supply chains has long been omnipresent, but as our world becomes more complex and our supply lines longer, the power of our supply chain management capabilities to create and destroy value is magnified. Why do our supply chains succeed or fail? The answer lies in alignment. The alignment of the needs and values of our customers, our own organisation and our suppliers.

Sainsbury recently lost share in the market by failing with their supply chain. Wal-mart and Dell won in the market by getting theirs right. Smart supply chains can be decisive. In the J Sainsbury debacle, there was nothing wrong with the strategy, except no one thought to check if the personnel in the company were capable of delivering such complex and sophisticated plan within such a short timeframe, and they are paying the price now. Unfortunately, this is not an isolated example - it is happening every day. Living Supply Chains is unique in looking beyond the systems and technology of your company, to developing the role of people and behaviour in placing customer-focused supply chains at the heart of their enterprise. Based on John Gattorna's empirical research, Living Supply Chains shows you how to drive the design and management of your supply chains by starting with your customers and understanding their dominant buying behaviours'. In most cases, only 3 or 4 of these will be dominant' and should then be hardwired' into the organization's selling approaches, performance indicators and logistics operations.

James Parker shows why \"doing the right thing\" isn't just naïve \"feel-goodism\": it's the most powerful rule for business success. Parker's stories won't just convince readers: they'll move them. He tells how, after 9/11, Southwest made three pivotal decisions: no layoffs, no pay cuts, and \"no-penalty, no-questions-asked refunds\" for any customer wanting them. The result: Southwest's revenue passenger miles for 4Q01 dropped by only 0.5%, and its market cap soon exceeded all its major competitors combined.

This book takes a cool look at the subject and shows you what makes it relevant to your business. A big part of the answer is energy. Computers consume a lot of energy, and energy costs money. The cost of powering and cooling data servers over three years is currently 1.5 times the cost of purchasing the server hardware. Over the next two decades, global demand for energy is predicted to rise by 50%, which means that your long-term energy costs are also likely to increase. In the end, if your organisation's energy costs are high, it makes sense for you to focus on ways to reduce energy consumption. Improving the efficiency of data centre power supplies and reducing IT power requirements in the office are examples of how Green IT can yield a substantial return on investment.\n\nThis business guide to Green IT was written to introduce, to a business audience, the opposing groups and the key climate change concepts, to provide an overview of a Green IT strategy and to set out a straightforward, bottom-line orientated Green IT action plan.\n\nBenefits to business of a Green IT strategy:\n\nCut costs A Green IT strategy, including such measures as switching off PCs at night, or introducing Cloud Computing, will enable you to reduce the amount of energy that your organisation consumes and, therefore, to cut costs.\nImprove sales Products that can demonstrate their green credentials are more attractive to consumers. As organisations pursue more ambitious environmental objectives, they are putting their suppliers under increasing pressure to improve their own environmental record. Meanwhile, the public sector has adopted rigorous standards for Green procurement. With Green IT you can help your company to reach more customers and to win new business.\nEnhance your organisation's reputation The environment is an emotional issue, and environmental concerns affect the way your company is perceived by consumers. Green IT will support your company's Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) strategy by reducing the environmental impact of your operations. The evidence suggests that the market rewards companies whose practices are environmentally responsible.\nConform to regulations and standards New regulations, such as the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directive, aim to reduce the effects on the environment resulting from the use and disposal of IT equipment. Such regulations apply in many different countries, so compliance will help your business to operate at an international level.\n\nGreen social responsibility\n\nConsumers have a more positive view of a company that takes its corporate social responsibility seriously, and addressing environmental concerns is now an important component of any organisation's CSR. In the UK, the Companies Act 2006 introduced a statutory requirement for public companies to report on social and environmental matters. Thanks to the growing interest in ethical investment, CSR is also becoming a higher priority in terms of investor relations. All organisations in the developed world now use information technology. They should, therefore, plan to reduce the environmental impacts of their IT use within the framework of their overall CSR policy.\n\nThis book offers a practical, balanced assessment, which will enable company directors and executives to appreciate the business benefits of a Green IT strategy.\n\nBuy this book to find out how a Green IT strategy can benefit your bottom line!","tags":["Business","Operations","Green Business Practices"]},{"id":"9781484208328","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Winning the Institutional Investing Race: A Guide for Directors and Executives","authors":["Michael Bunn","Zack Campbell"],"pages":"132","publication_date":"November 2014","description":"The complexity of investments continues to grow, and institutional pools of capital from endowments to pension funds are suffering from too much risk and not enough return. Yet managing these investments and creating and implementing governance structures are seldom an integral part of the organization’s core mission or its operations. \"That’s the way it has always been,\" say many directors and executives. As a result, a board of directors or investment committee often believes it needs to make all the decisions--or outsource money management and hope for the best.\n\nAs Winning the Institutional Investing Race: A Guide for Directors and Executives makes clear, that sentiment is a big mistake that can lead to poor returns, reduced capital to employ on behalf of the organizational mission, and even charges of malfeasance on the part of directors. Authors Michael Bunn and Zack Campbell, who advise companies and institutions on best practices in institutional investment, are determined to help institutions and companies learn to manage their capital funds like the real businesses they are. This hands-on book will show you:\n\nThe importance of governance in creating and overseeing investment policy\nThe roles and responsibilities of key stakeholders, especially board members\nHow to construct an effective investment policy statement\nAn overview of the four primary governance models available to trustees and the pros/cons of each\nHow to work with fund managers, in house or out, to get the highest returns possible\n\nBesides governance, this book covers a wide array of investment topics—modern portfolio theory, risk application, investment manager evaluation and manager search, asset allocation, and diversification, among others—while introducing a new and successful approach to managing investment portfolios.

Many of the business decisions these companies make tend to be hidden in systems that make poor decisions, or don't make them at all. Further, most systems aren't configured to learn from the past and therefore struggle to keep up with the pace of change.

The De Gruyter Handbook of Business Families brings together work from leading academics who explore emerging research themes relevant to business families, particularly drawing in new insights from adjacent disciplines that can advance the family business field.\n\nThe handbook challenges the traditional notion of the \"single firm–single family\" that has characterized most early research on family business. Recognizing that families may simultaneously own or control multiple businesses as well as substantial wealth beyond these firms in the form of financial and non-financial assets, this handbook focuses on business families rather than the narrower construct of family business. The contributions in this handbook explore the relatively neglected dynamics between individuals with family ties that shape the interaction between family and business; business families with multiple businesses; how business families adopt formal rules and processes around their joint activities; and the institutionalization of wealth and business families in society.\n\nThe De Gruyter Handbook of Business Families fills a gap in the family business research literature and is an essential reference work for researchers and graduate-level students in the area of business families.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Business Architecture"]},{"id":"9780132102681","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Great Workplaces Are Built on a Foundation of Respect","authors":["David Russo"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"April 2010","description":"This Element is an excerpt from 17 Rules Successful Companies Use to Attract and Keep Top Talent: Why Engaged Employees Are Your Greatest Sustainable Advantage (9780137146703) by David Russo.

Today’s most successful companies are taking a different approach: getting customers to market, sell, and create products for them.In assessing client value, most companies look at the money paid for their goods and services. But in this book, Customer Strategy Group CEO Bill Lee offers a compelling new vision for growth by maximizing your “return on relationship” with select customers—those that offer rich sources of hidden wealth. A different type of ROI, this strategy of making the most of your firm’s existing relationships is a modern approach to customer relations—one that yields a distinct business advantage.Illustrated by numerous case studies—Salesforce.com, SAS Institute, 3M, Microsoft, and others—The Hidden Wealth of Customers shows the value some customers can have by helping to market your offerings, penetrate foreign markets, leverage the demand-generating power of social media, build customer communities, improve innovation, and more. Lee explains how to effectively engage this crucial audience, which has the power to keep your strategy focused on important customer issues and increase profitability. When done right, your best customers will prospect for you while also speeding product adoption and improving customer satisfaction and long-term loyalty.

This text uses the philosophy of pragmatic constructivism to show how managerial beliefs that underlie action can be made explicit and so facilitate their assessment and improvement. This involves recognizing and integrating the four dimensions (facts, possibilities, values, and communication) that represent how managers relate to the reality in which they operate.\n\nWhen managerial beliefs are based on an accurate representation of reality, they are more likely to be successful. Problems occur where reality is misrepresented in managerial beliefs. This is especially so in performance management, as the book illustrates using real-world examples.

Yes, there was the promise of its disruptive innovation that could transform medicine by using something called messenger RNA, one of the body's building blocks of life, to combat disease. But its stock was under water. There were reports of a toxic work culture. And despite ten years of work, the company was still years away from delivering its first product. Investors were getting antsy, or worse, skeptical.\n\nThen the pandemic hit, and Moderna, at first reluctantly, became a central player in a global drama—a David to Big Pharma's Goliaths—turning its technology toward breaking the global grip of the terrible disease. By year's end, with the virus raging, Moderna delivered one of the world's first Covid-19 vaccines, with a stunningly high rate of protection. The achievement gave the world a way out of a crippling pandemic while validating Moderna's technology, transforming the company into a global industry power. Biotech, and the venture capital community that fuels it, will never be the same.\n\nWall Street Journal reporter Peter Loftus, veteran reporter covering the pharmaceutical and biotech industries and part of a Pulitzer Prize–finalist team, brings the inside story of Moderna, from its humble start at a casual lunch through its heady startup days, into the heart of the pandemic and beyond. With deep access to all of the major players, Loftus weaves a tale of science and business that brings to life Moderna's monumental feat of creating a vaccine that beat back a deadly virus and changed the business of medicine forever.\n\nThe Messenger spans a decade and is full of heroic efforts by ordinary people, lucky breaks, and life-and-death decisions. It's the story of a revolutionary idea, the evolution of a cutting-edge American industry, and one of the great achievements of this century.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Innovation"]},{"id":"9781606493069","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Five Golden Rules of Negotiation","authors":["Philippe Korda"],"pages":"206","publication_date":"September 2011","description":"This book is based upon detailed research on the behavior and skills of successful negotiators.

The frameworks of Cultural Linguistics, English as a Lingua Franca, World Englishes, and Business Discourse offer the theoretical and methodological grounding for the analysis of interviews with high-ranking Brazilian and German business people. Moreover, a side study on e-mail exchanges between Brazilian and German employees of a healthcare company serves as a test case for the results arising from the interviews, and helps understand other facets of authentic intercultural business communication.\n\nOffering new insights on English as a Lingua Franca in international business contexts, Business Negotiations in ELF from a Cultural Linguistic Perspective simultaneously provides a detailed cultural-conceptual account of business negotiations from the viewpoint of Brazilian and German business people and a secondary analysis of their pragmatic aspects.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Business Negotiation"]},{"id":"9780240804163","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Videoconferencing for the Real World","authors":["John Rhodes"],"pages":"260","publication_date":"April 2001","description":"\"John Rhodes' Videoconferencing for the Real World, is a one of the world's most comprehensive blueprints on the awesome power of videoconferencing.\"\nFrom the Foreword by Brad Caldwell\nChairman ICIA and President of\nIntegrated Media Services, Anaheim, CA\n\nDesigned to be useful to both technical and non-technical managers, Video-Conferencing for the Real World demystifies the subject of video communications.

What about asking a random person on the street if you could borrow their phone? If the idea makes you squeamish, you're not alone--social psychologists have found that doing these very things makes most of us almost unbearably uncomfortable.\n\nBut here's the funny thing: even though we hate to ask for help, most people are wired to be helpful. And that's a good thing, because every day in the modern, uber-collaborative workplace, we all need to know when and how to call in the cavalry.\n\nHowever, asking people for help isn't intuitive; in fact, a lot of our instincts are wrong. As a result, we do a poor job of calling in the reinforcements we need, leaving confused or even offended colleagues in our wake.\n\nThis pragmatic book explains how to get it right. With humor, insight, and engaging storytelling, Heidi Grant, PhD, describes how to elicit helpful behavior from your friends, family, and colleagues--in a way that leaves them feeling genuinely happy to lend a hand.\n\nWhether you're a first-time manager or a seasoned leader, getting people to pitch in is what leadership is. Fortunately, people have a natural instinct to help other human beings; you just need to know how to channel this urge into what it is you specifically need them to do. It's not manipulation.

Thompson","Charalambos L. Iacovou","H. Jeff Smith"],"pages":"8","publication_date":"April 2014","description":"All too frequently, executives are caught by surprise when projects — especially complex IT projects — run into trouble. But complex projects do not fail overnight; they fail one day at a time, and generally only after numerous warning signs. The authors have been involved in 14 academic studies about the ways in which individuals report (and misreport) the status of IT projects and how the recipients of those reports respond to the information they receive. The authors’ research suggests that understanding the underlying dynamics of project status reporting can help limit the chances of nasty surprises. In particular, they identify five “inconvenient truths” about project status reporting:1. Executives can’t rely on project staff and other employees to accurately report project status information and to speak up when they see problems. Many employees have a tendency to put a positive spin on anything they report to senior management. When the organizational climate is not receptive to bad news, truthful reporting can be inhibited 2. A variety of reasons can cause people to misreport about project status. Executives tend to attribute misreporting to poor ethical behavior on the employee’s part. In fact, employees misreport for a variety of reasons; individual traits, work climate and cultural norms all can play a role.3. An aggressive audit team can’t counter the effects of project status misreporting and withholding of information by project staff. Executives may conclude that the best way to address the problem of misreporting is to rely on auditors to make sure that project status reports are accurate. However, once auditors are added to the mix, negative organizational dynamics can lead to a dysfunctional cycle that results in even less openness.4. Putting a senior executive in charge of a project may increase misreporting. Although having a senior executive as a project sponsor often proves wise politically and can help in securing resources for a project, the involvement of senior leaders does not make it any easier to track project status.5. Executives often ignore bad news if they do receive it. A number of the authors’ studies found situations where employees went to share their concerns about a project with powerful decision makers who had the ability to change the course of the project (or stop it), but were unsuccessful. The authors propose solutions to reduce the risk of being blindsided by any of these inconvenient truths. They include a self-diagnostic survey to help you assess whether you may be at risk for an unpleasant project management surprise.","tags":["Business","Project & Product Management","Project Management"]},{"id":"53863MIT65216","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Role of Culture in Enabling Change","authors":["Jonathan Knowles","B.

As a professional in the business world, you care about doing your job the right way. The quality of your work matters to you, both as a professional and as a person. The company you work for cares about making money and your boss is evaluated on that basis. Sometimes those goals overlap, but the different priorities mean conflict is inevitable. Take concrete steps to build a relationship with your manager that helps both sides succeed.\n\nGuide your manager to treat you as a vital member of the team who should be kept as happy and productive as possible.\n\nWhen your manager insists on a course of action you don't like, most employees feel they have only two options: you can swallow your objections, or you can leave. Neither option gets you what you want, which is for your manager to consider your interests when making decisions. Challenging your boss directly is risky, but if you understand what really matters to your manager, you can build a balanced relationship that works for both sides.\n\nProvide timely \"good enough\" answers that satisfy the immediate need of the boss to move forward. Use a productive solution to the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma to structure your interactions with management, going along when necessary and pushing back where appropriate, without threatening the loyalty relationship. Send the two most important messages to your boss: \"I got this\" and \"I got your back,\" to prove your value to the boss and the organization. Analyze your manager's communication preferences so you can express your arguments in a way most likely to be heard and understood. Avoid key traps, like thinking of the boss as your friend or violating the chain of command unnecessarily.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Career Development"]},{"id":"9781806386895","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Mastering QuickBooks 2026 - Seventh Edition","authors":["Crystalynn Shelton"],"pages":"544","publication_date":"December 2025","description":"Harness AI-driven automation, streamline workflows, and apply real-world case studies to simplify modern bookkeeping\n\nKey Features\nBe the first to explore AI-powered QuickBooks workflows, including Intuit Assist and AI Agents\nApply learning through real-world case studies across retail, services, and property management\nReinforce your knowledge with a companion workbook and exclusive video tutorials on bookkeeping and financial reporting\nFree with your book: PDF Copy, AI Assistant, and Next-Gen Reader\nBook Description\n\nUnlock smarter, faster, and more confident bookkeeping with the new edition of the bestselling Mastering QuickBooks series – one of the most comprehensive guides to US QuickBooks Online.

Kirkpatrick II, the world’s most influential technical analyst\n\nThere’s only one way to successfully compete with Wall Street’s “big boys”: use algorithmic systems, just like they do. Fortunately, you can. Thanks to the wide availability of derivatives, cheap computing, and low-cost, high-speed trading platforms, you can run algorithmic systems that are proven statistically and can operate almost automatically.\n\nIn this book, world-renowned technical analysis expert Charles D. Kirkpatrick II presents these systems and the evidence that supports them. Building on exhaustive research, Kirkpatrick shows why relative strength systems deliver consistent profits. Next, he drills down to identify the optimal elements of such systems, including lookback periods, ranks/ratios for portfolio changes, minimum trading volumes, and techniques for limiting the impact of market declines.\n\nKirkpatrick’s final results are practical and robust. Based on easy-to-interpret ADX, forward line, and 3-bar reversal charts, they are easy enough for virtually any investor to use, with any size portfolio.\n\nAt its foundation, technical analysis involves recognizing and analyzing trends and identifying the best investment strategy to take advantage of them.

In Kirkpatrick's Investment and Trading Strategies, world-renowned technical analysis researcher Charles D. Kirkpatrick II presents tested, pinpoint approaches to stock investing that are far more effective and efficient.\n\nDrawing on statistical testing of markets from 1990 to the present, Kirkpatrick identifies combinations of technical tests that have consistently delivered the best performance. Using them, he shows how to identify stocks that are now demonstrating the strongest relative and absolute strength. Next, he identifies specific trend following indicators most likely to identify the first signs of trend reversals--and, thus, the right time to sell.\n\nThroughout, Kirkpatrick offers detailed, practical, and example-rich guidance for using these indicators, providing all the detail you need to implement an investment strategy that is both profitable and risk-averse.\n\nTested, trend-based indicators you can understand and rely onChoose the right stocks--and the right times to buy and sell them\n\nProtect your capital with DMI, ADX, and other key technical indicatorsDiscover your true risk of loss and systematically protect against it\n\nWhy Kirkpatrick’s relative strength system works so wellUnderstand the statistics behind the system--in as much detail as you’d like\n\nUsing the system after you’ve implemented itRealistic examples and step-by-step instructions","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Financial Markets","Technical Analysis"]},{"id":"9780444534507","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"HANDBOOK OF LABOR ECONOMICS, VOL 4A","authors":["Orley Ashenfelter","David Card"],"pages":"864","publication_date":"October 2010","description":"What new tools and models are enriching labor economics?\n\n\"Developments in Research Methods and their Application\" (volume 4A) summarizes recent advances in the ways economists study wages, employment, and labor markets.  Mixing conceptual models and empirical work, contributors cover subjects as diverse as field and laboratory experiments, program evaluation, and behavioral models.  The combinations of these improved empirical findings with new models reveal how labor economists are developing new and innovative ways to measure key parameters and test important hypotheses.\n\nInvestigates recent advances in methods and models used in labor economics\nDemonstrates what these new tools and techniques can accomplish\nDocuments how conceptual models and empirical work explain important practical issues","tags":["Business","Economics"]},{"id":"9781484291924","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Scaling Customer Success: Building the Customer Success Center of Excellence","authors":["Chitra Madhwacharyula","Shreesha Ramdas"],"pages":"273","publication_date":"March 2023","description":"​Customer Success is a relatively a new discipline that focuses on maximizing customer business value and outcomes realization.

Now, drawing on the nearly 40 years of human computer interaction research–including his own pioneering work–Dr. Steven Seow presents state-of-the-art best practices for reflecting users’ subjective perceptions of time in your applications and hardware.\n\nSeow begins by introducing a simple model that explains how users perceive and expend time as they interact with technology. He offers specific guidance and recommendations related to several key aspects of time and timing–including user tolerance, system responsiveness, progress indicators, completion time estimates, and more. Finally, he brings together proven techniques for impacting users’ perception of time drawn from multiple disciplines and industries, ranging from psychology to retail, animal research to entertainment.\n\n     •    Discover how time and timing powerfully impact user perception, emotions, and behavior\n\n     •    Systematically make your applications more considerate of users’ time\n\n     •    Avoid common mistakes that consistently frustrate or infuriate users\n\n     •    Manage user perceptions and tolerance, and build systems that are perceived as faster\n\n     •    Optimize “flow” to make users feel more productive, empowered, and creative\n\n     •    Make reasonable and informed tradeoffs that maximize limited development resources\n\n     •    Learn how to test usability issues related to time–including actual vs. perceived task duration\n\nDesigning and Engineering Time is for every technology developer, designer, engineer, architect, usability specialist, manager, and marketer. Using its insights and techniques, technical and non-technical professionals can work together to build systems and applications that provide far more value–and create much happier users.\n\nSteven C. Seow has a unique combination of experience in both experimental psychology and software usability. He joined Microsoft as a User Researcher after completing his Ph.D. in Experimental Psychology at Brown University with a research focus on human timing and information theory models of human performance. Seow holds Bachelor’s and Master’s Degrees in Forensic Psychology from John Jay College of Criminal Justice, and wrote his master’s thesis on distortions in time perception.

Economists call matchmakers multisided platforms because they provide physical or virtual platforms for multiple groups to get together. Dating sites connect people with potential matches, for example, and ride-sharing apps do the same for drivers and riders. Although matchmakers have been around for millennia, they’re becoming more and more popularand profitabledue to dramatic advances in technology, and a lot of companies that have managed to crack the code of this business model have become today’s power brokers.Don’t let the flashy successes fool you, though. Starting a matchmaker is one of the toughest business challenges, and almost everyone who tries to build one, fails.In Matchmakers, David Evans and Richard Schmalensee, two economists who were among the first to analyze multisided platforms and discover their principles, and who’ve consulted for some of the most successful platform businesses in the world, explain how matchmakers work best in practice, why they do what they do, and how entrepreneurs can improve their chances for success.Whether you’re an entrepreneur, an investor, a consumer, or an executive, your future will involve more and more multisided platforms, and Matchmakersrich with stories from platform winners and losersis the one book you’ll need in order to navigate this appealing but confusing world.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Entrepreneurship"]},{"id":"9781523098033","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Big Four","authors":["Ian D.

'The Big Four' will appeal to all those interested in the future of the profession--and of capitalism itself.\" —Jane Gleeson-White, Wall Street JournalWith staffs that are collectively larger than the Russian army and combined revenues of over $130 billion a year, the Big Four accounting firms—Deloitte, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Ernst & Young, and KPMG—are a keystone of global commerce. But leading scholar Ian Gow and award-winning author Stuart Kells warn that a house of cards may be about to fall.Stretching back to the Medicis in Renaissance Florence, this book is a fascinating story of wealth, power, and luck. The founders of the Big Four lived surprisingly colorful lives. Samuel Price, for example, married his own niece. Between the world wars, Nicholas Waterhouse collected postage stamps while also hosting decadent parties in his fashionable London home. All four firms have endured major calamities in recent decades. There have been hundreds of court cases and legal prosecutions for failed audits, tax scandals, and breaches of independence. The firms have come so close to “extinction level events” that regulators have required them to prepare “living wills.” And today, the Big Four face an uncertain future—thanks to their push into China, their vulnerability to digital disruption and competition, and the hazards of providing traditional services in a new era of transparency. This account of the past, present, and likely future of the Big Four is essential reading for anyone perplexed or fascinated by professional services, working or considering working in the industry, or simply curious about the fate of the global economy.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting"]},{"id":"9780133988222","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Inside Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3","authors":["The Microsoft Dynamics AX Team"],"pages":"840","publication_date":"August 2014","description":"Fully updated for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3!\n\nDig into the architecture and internals of Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3 - with firsthand insights from the team that designed and developed it.

Rouse","Francis Bidault"],"pages":"7","publication_date":"April 2013","description":"The number of companies that outsource critical business processes to outside suppliers has been growing significantly worldwide. In 2012, companies outsourced some $309 billion of services — activities including finance and accounting, human resource management, procurement and legal services — and the overall volume has been growing at a rate of around 25% annually. Although many organizations initiated business process outsourcing (BPO) as part of an effort to reduce costs or acquire new skills, it has since evolved into much more. Today, senior managers want more than shortterm cost savings, and they are skeptical of big-bang improvements. In relationships companies classify as high performing, the authors found that service providers perform ongoing innovation projects that deliver substantial long-term improvements to the client’s operating efficiency, business process effectiveness and strategic performance.These types of innovations require companies and service providers to work together. BPO providers do not need incentives to improve their own revenue or margins, but they do need them to focus on the client’s performance. The authors found that both clients and providers identified several important measures, including mandatory productivity targets, innovation days and gain sharing at the project level, as the most effective incentives. Other approaches involved making sure that providers know that they don’t have a lock on the business and introducing special governance provisions, such as committees dedicated specifically to innovation.While partners may incentivize innovation by using mechanisms such as productivity targets, allocating innovation days and agreeing to gain share on innovation projects, the authors argue that innovation won’t happen unless clients and providers implement a more comprehensive process that combines acculturation across different organizations, an engaging method for generating ideas, adequate funding and a system for managing change.Perhaps the most significant factor in BPO innovation, however, was whether the right people were in place to drive the dynamic innovation process. The authors found that an effective leadership pair — one person from the client organization and another person from the provider organization — went a long way toward invigorating the innovation process. In the high-performing BPO relationships the authors looked at, the leaders were experienced and capable, with high levels of credibility, clout and power within their own organizations.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Innovation"]},{"id":"53863MIT64311","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"New Threats to the Subscription Model","authors":["Oded Koenigsberg"],"pages":"6","publication_date":"February 2023","description":"Proponents of the subscription model argue that it offers customers a better user experience and a lower barrier to access, while providers gain predictability and ease of communication with customers.

Why? Because they are getting people wrong.Traditional problem-solving methods taught in business schools serve us well for some of the everyday challenges of business, but they tend to be ineffective with problems involving a high degree of uncertainty. Why? Because, more often than not, these tools are based on a flawed model of human behavior. And that flawed model is the invisible scaffolding that supports our surveys, our focus groups, our R&D, and much of our long-term strategic planning.In The Moment of Clarity, Christian Madsbjerg and Mikkel Rasmussen examine the business world’s assumptions about human behavior and show how these assumptions can lead businesses off track. But the authors chart a way forward. Using theories and tools from the human sciences—anthropology, sociology, philosophy, and psychology—The Moment of Clarity introduces a practical framework called sensemaking. Sensemaking’s nonlinear problem-solving approach gives executives a better way to understand business challenges involving shifts in human behavior.This new methodology, a fundamentally different way to think about strategy, is already taking off in Fortune 100 companies around the world. Through compelling case studies and their direct experience with LEGO, Samsung, Adidas, Coloplast, and Intel, Madsbjerg and Rasmussen will show you how to solve problems as diverse as setting company direction, driving growth, improving sales models, understanding the real culture of your organization, and finding your way in new markets. Over and over again, executives say the same thing after engaging in a process of sensemaking: “Now I see it . . .” This experience—the moment of clarity—has the potential to drive the entire strategic future of your company.

Brown"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"March 2010","description":"The worst stock market crash since Black Monday during October of 1987 occurred during the first week of August of 2007. But nobody noticed.\n\nOn the morning of August 6th 2007, investment professionals were baffled with unprecedented stock patterns. Mining sector stocks were up +18% but manufacturing stocks were down -14%. It was an extreme sector skew yet the S&P index was unchanged at +0.5% on the day. The next few days would continue with excessive volatility. MBI Insurance, a stock that had rarely attracted speculation would finish up +15% on Aug 6th, followed by another +7% on Aug 7th, and then finish down -22% over the subsequent two days. The brief rally in MBI was short lived.\n\nOnly weeks later would investors begin to have insights on the dispersion patterns. Prominent hedge funds that had never had a negative annual performance began disclosing excessive trading loses with many notable firms reporting several hundred millions were lost  - in a single day. Hedge funds were hemorrhaging in excess of 30% of their assets when the S&P index was unchanged.  The market dispersion was the side effects of the synchronous unwind ignited by the hordes of \"computerized\" strategies that were caught off guard when history didn't repeat. It was the industry's first world wide panic - by machines.\n\nOver the past decade, computerized (or black-box) trading has had a coming of age. Black-box firms use mathematical formulas to buy and sell stocks. The industry attracts the likes of mathematicians, astrophysics and robot scientists. They describe their investment strategy as a marriage of economics and science. Their proliferation has been on the back of success, black-box firms have been among the best performing funds over the past decade, the marquee firms have generated double-digit performance with few if any months of negative returns.\n\nThrough their coming of age, these obscure mathematicians have joined the ranks of traditional buy-n-hold investors in their influence of market valuations. A rally into the market close is just as likely the byproduct of a technical signal as an earnings revision. They are speculated to represent a one third of all market volume albeit their influence to the day-to-day gyrations goes largely unnoticed. CNBC rarely comments on the sentiments of computerized investors.\n\nConventional wisdom suggests that markets are efficient, random walks and that stock prices rise and fall with the fundamentals of the company. How then have black-box traders prospered and how do they exploit market inefficiencies? Are their strategies on their last legs or will they adapt to the new landscape amidst the global financial crisis?\n\nChasing the Same Signals is a unique chronicle of the black-box industry's rise to prominence and their influence on the market place. This is not a story about what signals they chase, but rather a story on how they chase and compete for the same signals.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Financial Markets","Trading Stocks"]},{"id":"9781484265192","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Goliath Strikes Back: How Traditional Retailers Are Winning Back Customers from Ecommerce Startups","authors":["Peter S.

We need to depart a kingdom that creates isolation, polarized debate, an exhausted planet, and violence that comes with the will to empire. The abbreviation of this empire is called a consumer culture.\n\nWe think the free market ideology that surrounds us is true and inevitable and represents progress. We are called to better adapt, be more agile, more lean, more schooled, more, more, more. Give it up. There is no such thing as customer satisfaction.\n\nWe need a new narrative, a shift in our thinking and speaking. An Other Kingdom takes us out of a culture of addictive consumption into a place where life is ours to create together.  This satisfying way depends upon a neighborly covenant—an agreement that we together, will better raise our children, be healthy, be connected, be safe, and provide a livelihood.

Safronov"],"pages":"380","publication_date":"August 2023","description":"Safronov’s Nietzsche’s Political Economy is a pioneering appraisal of Nietzsche’s critique of industrial culture and its unfolding crisis. The author contends that Nietzsche remains unique in conceptualizing the upheavals of modern political economy in terms of the crisis of its governing values. Nietzsche scrutinises the norms which, not only preside over the unfathomable build-up in debt, the proliferation of meaningless, impersonal slavery and the rise of increasingly repressive social control systems, but inevitably set these precarious tendencies of modern political economy on a collision course liable to culminate in an unprecedented human and environmental catastrophe. Safronov explores the core themes of Nietzsche’s political economy—debt, slavery, and the division of labour—with reference to the influential views of Adam Smith and Karl Marx, as well as against the backdrop of the Long Depression (1873–1896), the first truly international crisis of industrial capitalism, during which most of Nietzsche’s work was completed.\n\nIn Nietzsche’s assessment, modern political economy is predicated on the valuations that diminish humankind’s prospects and harm the planet’s future by consistently enfeebling the present, as long as there is profit to be made from it. Nietzsche’s critical insight, which challenges the most fundamental tenet of modern economics and finance, is that in order to build a stronger and intrinsically more valuable future in lieu of simply speculating on it, as though the liberal Promised Land could descend upon us like the manna from heaven at the wave of an invisible hand [of the market], it is necessary to walk from the future we dare to envisage resolutely back to the present we inhabit to determine what demands achieving such a vision would impose upon us, instead of embellishing the ‘here and now’ by cynically discounting the future to the [net] value of the present while disparaging, disowning and rewriting the past to unburden ourselves of its troubling legacy, as we continue to frivolously squander its capital to the alluring tunes of the ‘sirens who in the marketplace sing to us of the future’. The enabling mechanism for changing our valuing perspectives, Nietzsche tells us, lies dormant in us and it must be unlocked before it is too late.","tags":["Business","Economics"]},{"id":"9781647825416","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Shocks, Crises, and False Alarms","authors":["Philipp Carlsson-Szlezak","Paul Swartz"],"pages":"320","publication_date":"July 2024","description":"Financial Times Best Books of 2024: Economics — Martin Wolf\n\n\"...an invaluable framework to better understanding growth, the financial sector, and the key trends shaping the global economy\" — Financial Times, Tej Parikh\n\nThe shocks and crises of recent years—pandemic, recession, inflation, war—have forced executives and investors to recognize that the macroeconomy is now a risk to be actively managed. Yet unreliable forecasting, pervasive doomsaying, and whipsawing data severely hamper the task of decoding the landscape. Are disruptions transient and ephemeral—or permanent and structural? False alarms are costly traps, but so are true structural changes that go undetected.\n\nHow can leaders avoid these macro traps to make better tactical and strategic decisions?\n\nIn this perspective-shifting book, BCG Chief Economist Philipp Carlsson-Szlezak and Senior Economist Paul Swartz provide a fresh and accessible way to assess macroeconomic risk. Casting doubt on conventional model-based thinking, they demonstrate a more powerful approach to building sound macroeconomic judgment. Using incisive analysis built upon frameworks, historical context, and structural narratives—what they call \"economic eclecticism\"—the book empowers readers with the durable skills to assess continuously evolving risks in the real economy, the financial system, and the geopolitical arena.\n\nMoreover, the authors' more nuanced approach reveals that the all-too-common narratives of economic collapse and decline are often false alarms themselves, while the fundamental strengths of our current \"era of tightness\" become visible.\n\nWith rational optimism rather than gloom, Shocks, Crises, and False Alarms speaks to the key financial and macroeconomic controversies that define our times—and provides a compass for navigating the global economy.

Written by a 30-year veteran of the leadership consulting industry and author of Trust in the Balance, the book contains examples, worksheets and surveys that illustrate the practical application of the advice presented. An online questionnaire helps readers discover their own leadership vulnerabilities, and the book provides a roadmap for creating a targeted plan to increase their awareness in the areas that truly matter.\n\nThe blindspot risk is that leaders fail to respond to weaknesses or threats due to a variety of factors including the complexity of their organizations, over-confidence in their own capabilities, and being surrounded by deferential subordinates.

The book details a range of techniques that make blindspots stand out in sharp relief, so action can be taken before severe damage occurs - to a leader or his or her company. Topics include:\n\nA framework to understand the threats posed by blindspots\n\nThe four most important types of blindspots - self, team, company and markets\n\nDetailed case studies of blindspots in leaders across a variety of industries\n\nA summary of the most common leadership blindspots\n\nCorrective practices that help mitigate the risks that blindspots pose\n\nThe one characteristic great leaders share is the constant desire for self-improvement.

For over twenty years, Creating an Environment for Successful Projects has been a staple for upper managers who want to help projects succeed. This new edition includes case studies from companies that have successfully applied the approach, along with practical tools such as templates, surveys, and benchmark reports for savvy leaders who want to ensure project success throughout their organizations. The insights in this book will help management speed projects along instead of getting in their way. All too often, well-intentioned managers put roadblocks in the team's way instead of empowering them with the tools they need to succeed. This approach to project environments, grounded in decades of research and practice, will help you make your organization the most project-friendly it's ever been. Organizational changes rarely work unless upper management is heavily involved. Although project managers are most closely responsible for the success of projects, upper managers are the ones who ultimately create an environment that supports those projects. The way upper managers define, structure, and act toward projects has an important effect on the success or failure of those projects and, consequently, the success or failure of the organization. This book helps all managers understand the need for project management changes and shows how to develop project management as an organizational practice.","tags":["Business","Project & Product Management","Project Management"]},{"id":"9788131729458","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Economic Integration in South Asia","authors":["ActionAid Asia ActionAid International Asia"],"pages":"344","publication_date":"January 2010","description":"Economic Integration in South Asia: Issues and Pathways is one of the volumes of the series titled, Imagine a New South Asia, presented by ActionAid International Asia.

Too many companies lose time, customers and income because of circumstances beyond their control. Companies that have a business continuity plan in place are able to not only minimise losses and retain clients, but also win new business!\n\nAccountability is also a new and growing aspect of running organisations. When things go wrong, people at the top are expected to be able to account for the decisions that they took, or didn't take, when times were better. Business continuity plans and arrangements developed on best-practice lines are far more likely to protect directors in the face of any post-incident enquiry.\n\nWhen customers are choosing suppliers, whether looking for new ones or reviewing which to keep, most are considering not only price, but quality, financial stability and operational resilience – whether a supplier is likely to be tripped over by the slightest incident, or whether it has some credible plan. Any company can say that it has a business continuity plan, but those that can demonstrate resilience based upon best-practice principles will surely have the edge over those that cannot.\n\nThe book will guide you through domestic and international standards relating to business continuity, with particular reference to ISO22301. Companies achieving certification under the Standard will communicate to their stakeholders their commitment to uninterrupted supply.\n\nThis practical guide will show you how business continuity management can help your organisation to:\n\ncarry out realistic risk identification and assessment\nput in place a cost-effective, 'fit-for-purpose' business continuity plan\nbe more competitive\nenjoy greater customer loyalty\nconform to the legal requirements in terms of accountability, compliance, risk awareness\nreturn to 'business as usual' as quickly as possible after an unforeseen incident.\n\nThe time for burying our corporate heads in the sand and thinking 'It won't happen to us' is long past. It is time to identify the risks and to increase your company's resilience in the face of potential disasters. Everything you want to know about Business Continuity will show you how to develop a modern response to the operational risk landscape and how to prepare your organisation for interruptions to your key activities, minimising the impact on your bottom line, reputation and credibility.

Therefore, from this perspective, debt can be viewed as the sale of a financial put option. As a result, financial analysts are able to establish different valuations of a company, according to these two financing methods. Valuation of the Liability Structure by Real Options explains how the real options method works in conjunction with traditional methods. This innovative approach is particularly suited to the valuation of companies in industries where an underlying asset has high volatility (such as the mining or oil industries) or where research and development costs are high (for example, the pharmaceutical industry). Integration of the economic value of net debt (rather than the accounting value) and integration of the asset volatility are the main advantages of this approach.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Corporate Valuation"]},{"id":"9780470828779","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Profitable Art and Science of Vibratrading: Non-Directional Vibrational Trading Methodologies for Consistent Profits","authors":["MARK ANDREW LIM"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"August 2011","description":"Author Mark Lim introduces his proprietary Vibratrading system for equity traders and investors\n\nVibratrading introduces a new and revolutionary perspective to trading and investing, with a powerful methodology to extract profit in every type of market environment.

Yet, most organizations that use appraisal-and a similar percentage of givers and receivers of appraisal-are dissatisfied with the process. Many are beginning to deeply question whether appraisal is necessary and consistent with the work culture espoused by progressive organizations. Abolishing Performance Appraisals provides an insightful, well documented look at the flaws of appraisal-including its destructive, unintended effects-and offers practical guidance to organizations that want to move on to more progressive approaches to coaching, feedback, development, and compensation.\n\nWhile many books prescribe cures for appraisal, this is the first to focus exclusively on eliminating appraisal altogether and creating alternative, non-appraisal approaches based upon progressive and healthier assumptions about people. The authors expose and dispel the widely accepted myths and false assumptions that underlie common management strategies surrounding the five key functions of appraisal-coaching, feedback, development, compensation, and legal documentation. They then offer step-by-step practical guidance on implementing alternative non-appraisal strategies that deliver the objectives of each function. And they suggest ways to give supervisors and managers the freedom to choose for themselves the most effective ways of working with people.\n\nFilled with real-life examples, resources, tools, and detailed practical advice, Abolishing Performance Appraisals is an entirely fresh and radically different view of performance appraisal and its functions that will help people start over and discover new and more effective approaches.","tags":["Business","Human Resources","Reviews & Metrics","Performance Reviews"]},{"id":"9781098158835","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Radar Trends to Watch: July 2023","authors":["Mike Loukides"],"pages":"10","publication_date":"July 2023","description":"Read about the latest developments on O'Reilly Media's Radar.","tags":["Business","Technology in Business"]},{"id":"53863MIT60467","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Adapt and Thrive","authors":["MIT Sloan Management Review"],"pages":"21","publication_date":"April 2019","description":"How can business leaders best understand the complex interplay between companies, economies, and societies?","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Business Ethics"]},{"id":"53863MIT59443","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Advantages and Disadvantages of Conflict at Work","authors":["MIT Sloan Management Review"],"pages":"72","publication_date":"July 2018","description":"Conflict can be a source of creativity and new ideas, or a weight that drags down people’s emotions and productivity.

Executives attempt to influence employees toward achieving business goals, and they attempt to prevent and detect wrongdoing, misconduct, and crime among employees. However, top-down approaches to corporate control do not work when executives and other privileged individuals in the business themselves commit and conceal their wrongdoing, misconduct, and crime in organizational settings. Then there is a need for a bottom-up approach in corporate control as outlined in this book.\n\nBottom-up control refers to the manner in which organizational members can use different types of control mechanisms – such as whistleblowing, transparency, resource access, or culture – to monitor, measure, and evaluate executives’ avoidance of deviant behaviors and influence them toward achieving the organization’s goals in efficient and effective ways.\n\nThe newly emerging perspective of a social license to operate forms part of the bottom-up strategy where criminalization becomes social property independent of the criminal justice system. The social license is predominantly centered on social permission for business activity where the media, social movements, and citizen watchdogs exert pressure, demand change, and bring top management to account.\n\nThis book presents a novel approach to corporate control of white-collar crime based on the theory of convenience. White-collar crime is financial crime committed by privileged individuals who have legitimate access to resources based on the power and trust inherent through their professional positions. Convenience theory proposes that motive, opportunity, and willingness are the three dimensions that underlie white-collar crime in an organizational context. This book contributes to the study of white-collar criminality through a blend of theoretical discussions and practical materials that illuminate and support the use of convenience theory. The book discusses how bottom-up approaches can overcome the difficulty of detecting white-collar crime and overcome the barriers of preventing executive deviance.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Business Ethics"]},{"id":"9780071791694","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Career Lattice: Combat Brain Drain, Improve Company Culture, and Attract Top Talent","authors":["Joanne Cleaver"],"pages":"272","publication_date":"May 2012","description":"Reroute your career path for better, faster, longer-lasting success\n\n“If you’ve been waiting for your HR department to plan out your next career move, you’ll be stuck waiting forever.

Once innovators and other leaders understand exactly which constraints are working against them and how to overcome them, they can create conditions that foster innovation instead of stopping it in its tracks.\n\nThe author's model of constraints on innovation integrates insights from the vast literature on innovation with his own observations of hundreds of organizations.

Woerner"],"pages":"8","publication_date":"July 2015","description":"The business world is rapidly digitizing, breaking down industry barriers and creating new opportunities while destroying long-successful business models. Given the amount of turmoil digital disruption is causing, authors Peter Weill and Stephanie L. Woerner of the MIT Center for Information Systems Research say it’s time for companies to evaluate these threats and opportunities and create new business options for the more-connected future of digital ecosystems. In recent research, board members at large companies estimated that 32% of their company’s revenue would be under threat from digital disruption in the next five years; 60% of board members felt their boards should spend significantly more time on this issue next year. Despite the threats from companies including Uber, Airbnb and Amazon, increasing digitization offers opportunities for companies to leverage strong customer relationships and increase cross-selling, the authors argue. The authors offer a framework, supported by examples, for helping managers think about their competitive environments. “The combination of moving from value chains to ecosystems and increasing consumer knowledge,” the authors write, “provides business leaders with four distinct business models, each with associated capabilities and relationships.” Companies can choose to operate as (1) suppliers, (2) omnichannel businesses, (3) modular producers or (4) ecosystem drivers. The authors found that businesses focused narrowly on value chains were at a disadvantage compared with those that thought more broadly about their business ecosystems. Companies that had 50% or more of their revenues from digital ecosystems and understood their end customers better than their average competitor saw 32% higher revenue growth and 27% higher profit margins than their industry averages. As they prepare for growing digital disruption, companies have two major decisions to make. First, they need to decide the extent to which they want to control the value chain or become part of a more complex ecosystem. Second, they need to decide how much they want to invest in knowing their end customers. Companies with ecosystem drivers as their dominant business model had the highest margins and growth of all the four options in the companies the authors studied.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Digital Transformation"]},{"id":"9780071804639","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Coaching for Breakthrough Success: Proven Techniques for Making Impossible Dreams Possible","authors":["Jack Canfield","Peter Chee"],"pages":"240","publication_date":"October 2012","description":"A powerful new coaching method from Chicken Soup for the Soul co-creator Jack Canfield!\n\nConveying his one-of-a-kind insight in the friendly, supremely organized way that has made him a household name, Canfield teams up with development guru Peter Chee to deliver the 30 top coaching principles you can put to use right away.

Polski reveals why the most effective political and economic policies are codified not in law, treaty, or culture, but in the networks embedded in our bodies and brains...and how protecting our prosperity requires us to adapt those networks to radically new realities.\n\nNext, Polski applies these fresh insights to three critical security issues: how best to defend our national interests; to take offensive action to protect our interests; and to strengthen our financial system. Finally, she provides “rules for the road” that can be applied to a world of problems: how best to compete in global markets; to build stronger, more secure communities; to manage energy and other key resources; to invest in and secure critical infrastructure; to address the structural impacts of trade; and to manage tomorrow’s catastrophes, both natural and man-made.\n\nAs a political economist, executive, government advisor, and consultant, Polski has spent more than two decades devising strategies for surviving change in the global political economy.

To prepare this book, the authors thoroughly examined the record of more than 250 innovation programs from organizations of widely differing sizes and industries, from 1998 through 2003. Based on this unprecedented research, they reveal the right time to use each innovation 'arrow', how to account for contingencies and risks; and how to focus on core innovation challenges -- not just superficial symptoms. Along the way, the authors define a focused, integrated model for innovation: one that is more nuanced and complex, but also better-grounded, more durable, and far more effective.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Innovation"]},{"id":"9780470639016","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"What's Holding You Back?: Ten Bold Steps That Define Gutsy Leaders","authors":["Robert J.

While individuals traditionally have seen ownership as the most desirable way, increasing numbers of consumers are paying to temporarily access or share products and services rather than buy or own them. This so-called “sharing economy” is growing rapidly, although estimates for the current size of the nascent market vary substantially. Well-known examples of successful startups built on collaborative consumption systems include Airbnb Inc.\n\nGrowth in sharing systems has been particularly fueled by the Internet with its rise of social media systems, which facilitate connections between peers eager to share their possessions. The central conceit of collaborative consumption is simple: obtain value from untapped potential residing in goods that are not entirely exploited by their owners.\n\nThe sharing economy might represent a serious threat to established industries. However, the authors’ research suggests six ways in which companies can respond: (1) by selling use of a product rather than ownership, (2) by supporting customers in their desire to resell goods, (3) by exploiting unused resources and capacities, (4) by providing repair and maintenance services, (5) by using collaborative consumption to target new customers, and (6) by developing entirely new business models enabled by collaborative consumption.","tags":["Business","Digital Economy","Gig Economy"]},{"id":"53863MIT64204","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Why Businesses Need to Embrace the Bioeconomy","authors":["Donna Marshall","Aideen O’Dochartaigh","Andrea Prothero"],"pages":"6","publication_date":"November 2022","description":"Companies seeking more sustainable product strategies should explore using biological (nonfossil) resources, waste streams, and manufacturing byproducts.

Schotter"],"pages":"8","publication_date":"July 2017","description":"Despite India’s economic growth and potential, developing a successful strategy for the country remains one of the most complex challenges for foreign multinationals. This challenge is rooted in the hard realities of global scale and costs. Most foreign executives have found it difficult to make money in India with their existing product portfolios at the scale of operations dictated by local demand. In addition, India has not provided foreign direct investment incentives anywhere near those of neighboring China. However, U.S. management consulting firm A.T. Kearney estimated in 2014 that India’s share of global trade would be approximately five times greater by 2025 — and at that point would represent 6% of all global trade. Given that growth projection, waiting for a target income segment to reach the break-even level or waiting for greater government incentives to materialize is not the right strategy. Indeed, the authors observe, many foreign multinationals have increased their focus on India.However, they add, many foreign executives are frustrated that they cannot replicate the same strategies in India that led to success in China. One reason is the local high-income segment, which constitutes the initial target market for most foreign companies, is relatively small in India compared with China. This often causes foreign executives to refrain from investing in more extensive value-chain activities in India and delay committing to local manufacturing.Based on their research, the authors present a framework for foreign multinationals for a successful first-time entry into India or for upgrading an existing operation in India that has not been very effective. This approach involves simultaneously taking advantage of local sourcing, manufacturing, and marketing activities in conjunction with local adaptation of global products to generate mutually reinforcing advantages. Foreign manufacturers in India, the authors argue, can use both globally focused assets to improve local sales and locally developed capabilities to deliver more cost-effective solutions for global markets. This combination enables companies to reach across all of India’s income segments, while at the same time developing a springboard for global exports.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","International Business"]},{"id":"9780415831765","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Further Essays in Monetary Economics (Collected Works of Harry Johnson)","authors":["Harry G.

Austin"],"pages":"6","publication_date":"July 2014","description":"In May 2013, software giant SAP announced plans to hire hundreds of people diagnosed with autism, with a target of having people with autism represent 1% of the company’s work force by 2020. The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines autism as a developmental disorder associated with “impairment of the ability to communicate with others” and “preoccupation with repetitive activities of restricted focus.” Companies don’t typically seek out these characteristics in new hires. But SAP took a different perspective. “We share a common belief that innovation comes from the ‘edges,’” one SAP executive stated in the company’s press release. “Only by employing people who think differently and spark innovation will SAP be prepared to handle the challenges of the 21st century.” More specifically, the company had discovered that some people with autism have abilities that are extremely well-suited to performing some vital information technology tasks. SAP’s move embodies an emerging management principle — the authors Robert D. Austin and Thorkil Sonne call it “the dandelion principle” — and offers an alternative way of thinking about human resources management. In some ways, the “dandelion principle” turns some of the basic tenets about how to recruit and manage people inside out. The authors use the dandelion as metaphor because, they note, dandelions are actually nutritious — but are seen as weeds in the context of a green lawn that demands uniformity. The industrial economy, the authors argue, required uniformity in operations. In the industrial economy, companies could often win by operating more efficiently than rivals. Today, that’s no longer enough. Faced with lower-cost competition from developing countries, established companies also need to innovate, to offer products that are better than what’s available from competitors. But innovation, the authors observe, calls for organizational capabilities different than efficiency. Efficiency requires getting people and machines to mesh more smoothly; the emphasis is on parts fitting in and reducing variation around averages. Innovation, by contrast, involves finding new and better ideas and using new processes. Managing innovation is less about averages and more about understanding outliers. The emphasis is on increasing interesting variation, then identifying value in some of the variants. In an innovation-oriented economy, the authors contend, companies may benefit from accommodating employees with different ways of viewing the world. For example, the authors observe that many managers in the tech industry have learned to accommodate eccentricities that highly talented tech workers may have. Traditional HR practices involved starting with fixed strategies, deriving job requirements, refining these into descriptions, then hiring and developing people to fit the roles. The dandelion principle, the authors explain, instead calls for hiring people with potentially differentiating skills and talents, assessing those skills carefully so you understand them, organizing the work context around the people to maximize their ability to create value, and then developing their inherent talents to enlarge the potential for future, unanticipated forms of value creation.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Innovation"]},{"id":"9781604914320","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Leadership in Action: A Question of Leadership - Should training in ethics be included in leadership development programs?","authors":["William Sternbergh","Peter J.

The rules and norms have changed—and so must leadership.\n\nAnd yet, coercive bureaucracy, hierarchy, and control—old ways of thinking and working—are still with us, a deep-seated and powerful legacy. We are living through a profound transition from an old, industrial era to a new one that is digital, transparent, and complex.\n\nIn this important new book by former dean of Harvard Business School Kim Clark, written with his business school professor son, Jonathan, and management consultant daughter, Erin, the dynamic struggle between two competing paradigms of leadership is compellingly illustrated: an old paradigm that involves control and power over people versus a new one that enables and inspires power through people.\n\nWith rich examples and stories, the authors show how deeply ingrained the legacy model of leadership remains and how destructive it is, causing waste and loss of human potential, stifling innovation, and ultimately resulting in what the authors call \"organizational darkness.\" They go on to articulate a new, positive model, one that consciously seeks to do good and to make things better; that cares for people, helping them to thrive; and that mobilizes people to solve tough problems. These three elements, they argue, are the soul, heart, and mind of leadership, and activating them requires careful attention to both the personal and the organizational dimensions of leadership.\n\nThe narrative is interwoven with probing analysis and reflection, and the authors speak clearly and frankly about the moral aspects and impact of leadership.

These and other transgressions – real or perceived – plague company brands and, as in the case of the #MeToo movement, human brands, routinely and globally. And they often come with serious consequences: consumer injury, billions of dollars in recovery and restitution, legal nightmares, bankruptcy, and damage to the brand. Despite their universal prevalence, negative outcomes, and the justified media frenzy around their occurrence, in-depth, thorough, and critical reflections on brand transgressions are scarce. Consequently, barring the lens of some quick-fix solution, managers lack a precise understanding of how to handle such potentially explosive situations.\n\nManaging Brand Transgressions: 8 Principles to Transform Your Brand presents over 25 case studies of brands like Boeing, Cadbury, Dolce & Gabbana, Fox News, Maggi, Starbucks, Stoli Vodka, and Tylenol in countries such as USA, China, India, UK, Germany, Italy, Japan, and Latvia.

They employ a large percentage of the work force. They have an undeniably huge impact on the national economy and wealth. Yet they are, for the most part, unmanaged. What passes for management is a combination of oversight and audit. Oversight is primarily reactive: offering negative feedback for failures and demanding additional rules and regulations to prevent reoccurrences. Audits look for \"bright line\" discrepancies and clear violations to those rules and regulations. Government operations are often criticized for \"waste and mismanagement.\"Yet the current situation, unfortunately, can best be described as one of \"un-management\" rather than \"mis-management.\" Government can run better. The purpose of this book is to look at how government can move from \"rule driven\" to \"leadership driven\" management. Specifically, it will document and discuss specific examples of successful cost informed decision making and cost management and control in government. It will also delineate the requirements of such success and explore the special needs of transforming the management culture of government from its well embedded past practices to a new paradigm of leadership driven management.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Auditing & Financial GRC"]},{"id":"9781118431948","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Leading the Epic Revolution: How CIOs Drive Innovation and Create Value Across the Enterprise","authors":["Hunter Muller"],"pages":"336","publication_date":"June 2013","description":"A must-read leadership guide for CIOs and executives whose careers depend on creating value and growth through continuous innovation\n\nInnovation is the hot topic.

The focus of such networks is usually on developing, distributing and applying knowledge. For-profit and nonprofit organizations of all sizes are seizing on this model to learn more quickly and collaborate productively. However, for every successful network, others have lost steam due to poor participation, goal ambiguity, mixed allegiances or technology mismatches. The authors sought to better understand the leverage that network leaders have. Their initial research, funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, focused on how knowledge networks could improve the spread of evidence about childhood and maternal nutrition. The authors used that research to develop a model of knowledge networks and later validated that model in organizations outside the international health space. In that process, they developed case studies of ConocoPhillips, the world’s largest independent exploration and production oil company, and Women’s World Banking, a global nonprofit operating in 28 countries.The authors identified eight network design dimensions that leaders of knowledge networks shouldconsider:1. Leaders’ Shared Theory of Change Successful knowledge network leaders can describe the mechanisms through which network activities will have an impact on members and organizations.2. Objectives/Outcomes/Purpose Leaders help to define the network’s purpose and target outcomes.3. Role of Expertise and Experimentation (also called the expert-learner duality) Leaders need to be clear on how the network makes it safe for even the expert to be vulnerable and learn and for the learner to speak of bold possibilities.4. Inclusion and Participation The networks’ core team explicitly defines what types of members they seek and actively recruits them.5. Operating Model Knowledge network leaders decide what roles, responsibilities and decision processes are needed for optimal network operations.6. Convening Structures and Infrastructures Network leaders understand how online and real-time or live convenings serve to build cohesion, connectivity, collaboration and engagement.7. Facilitation and Social Norm Development Knowledge network leaders take on the roles of facilitators and change agents, not just project managers. They convene members in meetings, discussions, games, events and other interactions.8. Measurement, Feedback and Incentives Network leaders look for evidence of success or failure in network participation, as well as ways to incentivize people to join, participate and engage.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Communication","Collaboration"]},{"id":"9780273785378","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Smarter Investing 3rd edn, 3rd Edition","authors":["Tim Hale"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"October 2013","description":"Simple yet effective advice for anyone who wants their money to work harder than they do.\n\n \n\nMost investment books offer a bewildering array of complex strategies for how best to invest your money.

In this landmark study, researchers were granted unprecedented access to reams of internal project documentation and hours of one-on-one time with key personnel, from C-Suite and project management executives to front-line staff. This enabled the team to assemble the inside story of how project portfolios were actually managed in each of these organizations, and identify what worked and what didn't. Using this understanding and a comprehensive literature review as a foundation, they created an empirically grounded definition of project portfolio management effectiveness that can be applied to organizations of all kinds. They were then able to identify the five critical process, organizational, and human factors that impact project portfolio management effectiveness and propose common-sense criteria for accurately measuring it.","tags":["Business","Project & Product Management","Project Management"]},{"id":"9781449388133","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"iPhone 3D Programming","authors":["Philip Rideout"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"May 2010","description":"What does it take to build an iPhone app with stunning 3D graphics?

A retailer, for example, may need to decide whether to bid more in a highly competitive auction. Or a manufacturer may want to determine how long to hold onto a money-losing plant as the economy sinks into a recession. In boom times, deals are often in demand and expensive (and acquirers tend to know it); but when the economy cools off, acquisitions fall out of favor and prices decline. Conventional capital budgeting methods for valuing acquisitions and investments (such as discounted cash flow) may result in overpricing in “hot” deal markets and underpricing in “cold” deal markets. By setting potential deals in the context of real options theory and behavioral economics, authors Han Smit and Dan Lovallo write, executives can compensate for potential biases. Investor exuberance, the positive sentiments of boards and interest by rivals can cause executives to view acquisition opportunities as more attractive than they actually are in “hot” deal markets. Loss aversion and a narrow perspective that does not consider long-term growth options, meanwhile, can subdue acquisition behavior during “cold” markets.The article is designed to improve the use of valuation methods and help mitigate decision biases. Treating acquisition decisions as simple go/no-go choices based on expected cash flows, the authorswrite, creates an unhealthy dynamic. Because it’s difficult for executives to recognize their own biases, the authors suggest using a formalized process to de-bias the decision-making team. First, managers must determine whether they are facing an investment in a “hot” or “cold” deal market (something that can often be revealed by the number of deals), after which the authors propose taking a broader view, supported by checklists. A valuation checklist can help executives temper their natural inclination to focus on growth options in “hot” markets and refocus it on staging, deferring or recouping their investments. Similarly, a checklist can help executives divert their natural attention from short-term risk to long-term growth options in “cold” deal markets.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy"]},{"id":"53863MIT62212","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"To Cut Costs, Know Your Customer","authors":["Vikas Mittal","Shrihari Sridhar","Roger Best"],"pages":"4","publication_date":"November 2020","description":"The pandemic is forcing many B2B companies to cut costs, but conventional approaches to cost reduction may not serve them well.

Today's global companies are at a crossroads, too-searching desperately for new sources of profitable growth. Stuart L.

It's about igniting new growth by creating sustainable products that solve urgent societal problems. It's about using new technology to deliver profitable solutions that reduce poverty and protect the environment. It's about becoming truly indigenous to all your markets, and avoiding the pitfalls of first-generation \"greening\" and \"sustainability\" strategies. Hart has thoroughly revised this seminal book with new case studies, trends, and lessons learned-including the latest experiences of leaders like GE and Wal-Mart.

The reason is that these companies have unique skills to diversify their revenue generation by being ambidextrous. Luxury companies today cannot depend on their reputation or their creativity alone to remain resilient, rather they require the ability to be ambidextrous – to explore new trajectories for future growth and exploiting their iconic values. In past decades, the industry has shifted from product to customer centric and forced companies to adopt new strategies and approaches to succeed. This includes the adoption of digital platforms such as ecommerce, social media and mobile enabled tools to continually elevate customer experience. In addition, new business models have emerged to address growing pains, particularly in inventory issues, over manufacturing and sustainability. Brands today are forced to adopt evolution through innovation that is anchored by new values without compromising their DNA. Based on in-depth research and interviews with CEOs from leading luxury companies, Lojacono and Pan show how companies can hedge their risks and remain resilient in times of change.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Innovation"]},{"id":"9780203502495","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Maximizing The Enterprise Information Assets","authors":["Timothy Wells","Christine Sevilla"],"pages":"352","publication_date":"May 2003","description":"Maximizing the Enterprise Information Assets defines practical, winning techniques for building an environment that takes advantage of all of a company's information resources.

Everything else comes after.\n\nIn Invent Reinvent Thrive Kellogg School of Management Professor Lloyd Shefsky provides the inspiration and insight any entrepreneur or family business needs for long-term success--and he backs it all up with proven models of what works and what doesn't.\n\nShefsky reveals the common thread of all business success stories: reinvention. He explains not just how to reinvent concepts and ideas from the start, but ways to continuously innovate and reinvent your business to meet today's constantly changing marketplace conditions. In addition to his own expert insight, Shefsky provides firsthand advice through case studies derived from dozens of original interviews with entrepreneurs and family business giants, consisting of the leaders of some of today's most successful companies, including:\n\nHoward Schultz (founder, Chairman, and CEO of Starbucks)\nJim Sinegal (founder of Costco)\nChuck Schwab (founder of Charles Schwab & Co.)\nTom Stemberg (founder of Staples)\n\nThe author also gives special attention to family businesses (which account for over half the U.S. GDP) and how to address vexing family disparities, enabling family businesses to last more than two generations.\n\nInvent Reinvent Thrive offers all the answers you need to get your business where you want it to be. You'll learn exactly where new and multi-generational business owners fall short and miss incredible opportunities, why they fail to take the plunge or innovate--and how you can rework, revitalize, and reinvent your business not just to avoid the most common perils but to lead your business to the apex of your industry.\n\n\"Entrepreneurship is not a cataclysmic event,\" Shefsky writes. \"It is a constant process.\" Follow his advice through every step of the process and you will successfully invent, reinvent--and thrive.\n\nPRAISE FOR INVENT REINVENT THRIVE:\n\n\"If you think business books are boring, this is your chance to prove yourself wrong. Storytelling is an art, and Shefsky brings that art to business.

Most are poorly served by the prevailing paradigm that obsessively focuses on what we do to produce short-term results while sabotaging who we are as healthy human beings. Few have seen alternatives, until now.\n\nGrounded proposes a new approach that's designed for actual humans who must grapple with these forces. This new paradigm speaks to our better selves. Based on the author's Healthy Leader model, it focuses on the six personal dimensions that fuel—and refuel—the world's top leaders: physical, emotional, intellectual, social, vocational, and spiritual health.\n\nThe book argues that leaders at every level can be more self-aware, develop their untapped potential, and drive significantly better results—for themselves, their teams, and their organizations.\n\nShows readers how to build a personal leadership model that works with their values, goals and capabilities\n\nFeatures fresh stories from leaders in a variety of organizations including the New York Fire Department, PricewaterhouseCoopers, The Lego Group, and Medstar Health\n\nGives leaders practical tools to face their toughest challenges with greater skill, confidence, and impact\n\nBy developing themselves and mastering the six dimensions, readers can gain the stamina and strength to not only weather tough times but to achieve much, much more.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9780787996048","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"In Extremis Leadership","authors":["Thomas A.

Various proposals for the reform of wage-fixing institutions are discussed, including the limitation of trade-union bargaining powers, an official incomes policy, labour management and ownership in business, and tax or subsidy measures to discourage inflationary rises in wages and prices.  \n\nThe book will be essential reading for all concerned with both the theory and policy of contemporary macroeconomics, industrial relations, labour economics and labour law. It has been written so that the general argument in the main text is accessible to the general reader as well as of interest to the professional economist.","tags":["Business","Economics"]},{"id":"9781631575679","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Dark Sides of Business and Higher Education Management, Volume II","authors":["Agata Stachowicz-Stanusch","Gianluigi Mangia"],"pages":"214","publication_date":"September 2016","description":"Contemporary management studies usually focus on positive and desirable solutions that increase the organizational effectiveness and performance. As a result, graduates of higher business schools are totally unaware of the risk associated with management misconduct that often results in corrupt scandals, erosion of public trust to their organizations, or even the collapse of profitable corporations. The last decade, in fact, has been abundant in numerous examples of corruption scandals in modern organizations and instances of management misconduct that have eroded public faith (such as Enron, WorldCom, Tyco, Adelphia, Arthur Andersen, and Parmalat). Due to repeated misconducts and a highly active dark side, scholars started paying more attention to the so-called Òdark sideÓ of organizations, as something no longer exceptional to organizational life. This book attempts to shed light on the reality of challenges for business practices and higher education management that stem from misconduct occurring in various aspects of business and educational environment.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Business Ethics"]},{"id":"9783110670288","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Universities, Entrepreneurial Ecosystems, and Sustainability","authors":["Cristina Fernandes","Marcela Ramírez-Pasillas","João J.

Crooks, corruption, scandals and panics have been regular features of the business landscape ever since, with regulations and the expansion of financial disclosure, auditing, and regulatory agencies following major debacles. The importance of this topic is demonstrated by the major accounting and finance scandals of the 21st century, some of the most destructive in our history, including Enron and the multi-trillion dollar real estate crises. This pair of scandals has an extensive number of companions (if less severe and not as well known). The types of violations, causes, and results are equally valid and continue to be of concern today.This short book reveals the signs that suggest financial corruption in organizations and proposes remedies to contain it and prevent its recurrence. It can be used as a supplementary source in introductory financial accounting courses (elementary and intermediate), accounting- and finance-related MBA courses, and business history; or it can be used as part of forensic accounting and fraud detection for continuing education. In addition, it can be useful for accounting and finance professionals wanting exposure to financial disclosure issues and other accounting risks, along with executives looking to expand their knowledge of accounting fraud and risk areas.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Accounting"]},{"id":"9781941651551","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Take Your Marketing Online!","authors":["Bonnie Buol Ruszczyk","Kelly Lucas","Sarah Warlick"],"pages":"160","publication_date":"May 2017","description":"In this comprehensive guide, CPA firm marketing expert Bonnie Buol Ruszczyk teaches the art of growing a firm in the digital age, guiding the firm through exercises to help them uncover their unique value while sharing proven techniques for communicating that value through the most effective online channels.
