To be socially responsible and ethical, Weiss maintains, businesses must acknowledge the impact their decisions can have on the world beyond their walls. An advantage of the book is the integration of a stakeholder perspective with an issues and crisis management approach so students can look at how a business's actions affect not just share price and profit but the well-being of employees, customers, suppliers, the local community, the larger society, other nations, and the environment. Weiss includes twenty-three cases that immerse students directly in contemporary ethical dilemmas. Eight new cases in this edition include Facebook's (mis)use of customer data, the impact of COVID-19 on higher education, the opioid epidemic, the rise of Uber, the rapid growth of AI, safety concerns over the Boeing 737, the Wells Fargo false saving accounts scandal, and plastics being dumped into the ocean. Several chapters feature a unique point/counterpoint exercise that challenges students to argue both sides of a heated ethical issue. This edition has eleven new point/counterpoint exercises, addressing questions like, Should tech giants be broken apart? What is the line between free speech and dangerous disinformation? Has the Me Too movement gone too far?

It is written from a general management perspective, and it draws on observations at 12 companies whose annual revenues range between $500 million and $20 billion. Over the past 15 years, my company has formulated vendor-neutral business-focused BI strategies and program execution plans in collaboration with manufacturers, distributors, retailers, logistics companies, insurers, investment companies, credit unions, and utilities, among others. It is through these experiences that we have validated business-driven BI strategy formulation methods and identified common enterprise BI program execution challenges.\n\nIn recent years, terms like “big data and “big data analytics have been introduced into the business and technical lexicon. Upon close examination, the newer terminology is about the same thing that BI has always been about: analyzing the vast amounts of data that companies generate and/or purchase in the course of business as a means of improving profitability and competitiveness. Accordingly, we will use the terms BI and business intelligence throughout the book, and we will discuss the newer concepts like big data as appropriate.

It is through these experiences that we have validated business-driven BI strategy formulation methods and identified common enterprise BI program execution challenges.\n\nIn recent years, terms like “big data and “big data analytics have been introduced into the business and technical lexicon. Upon close examination, the newer terminology is about the same thing that BI has always been about: analyzing the vast amounts of data that companies generate and/or purchase in the course of business as a means of improving profitability and competitiveness. Accordingly, we will use the terms BI and business intelligence throughout the book, and we will discuss the newer concepts like big data as appropriate. More broadly, the goal of this book is to share methods and observations that will help companies achieve BI success and thereby increase revenues, reduce costs, or both.\n\nProvides ideas for improving the business performance of one’s company or business functions\nEmphasizes proven, practical, step-by-step methods that readers can readily apply in their companies\nIncludes exercises and case studies with road-tested advice about formulating BI strategies and program plans","tags":["Data","Data Science","Business Intelligence"]},{"id":"9781394292363","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Microsoft 365 PowerPoint For Dummies, 2nd Edition","authors":["Doug Lowe"],"pages":"400","publication_date":"February 2025","description":"Present like a pro, with the top-selling PowerPoint book on the market\n\nSince 1999, PowerPoint For Dummies has been giving readers a jargon-free way to compose compelling presentations.

Yet strategic initiatives continue to fail as often as they did when computers ran on punch cards. Economist and research scientist Alec Levenson says we need a new approach. The problem, Levenson says, is that the business people who devise the strategies and the human resources people who get employees to implement them use completely different analytics. Business analytics can determine if operational priorities aren't being achieved but can't explain why. HR analytics reveal potentially helpful policy and process improvements but can't identify which would have the greatest strategic impact. This book shows how to use an integrated approach to bring these two pieces together. Levenson presents a thorough and realistic treatment of the reasons for and challenges of taking an integrated approach. He provides details on the different parts of both enterprise and human capital analytics that have to be conducted for integration to be successful and includes specific questions to ask, along with examples of applying integrated analytics to address particular organizational challenges.Effective analytics is a team sport. Levenson's approach allows you to get the deepest insights by bringing people together from both the business and HR perspectives to assess what's going on and determine the right solution.","tags":["Data","Data Science","Business Intelligence","Prescriptive Analytics"]},{"id":"9781265495459","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Negotiation Essentials: The Tools You Need to Find Common Ground and Walk Away a Winner","authors":["Keld Jensen"],"pages":"208","publication_date":"November 2023","description":"Actionable, easy-to-understand negotiating strategies you can use to dramatically improve your business, career, and personal life\n\nNegotiations can be a perplexing and often-intimidating endeavor.

Providing a framework for the development of sound judgment and the ability to utilize quantitative and qualitative approaches, Data Driven Business Decisions introduces readers to the important role that data plays in understanding business outcomes, addressing four general areas that managers need to know about: data handling and Microsoft Excel, uncertainty, the relationship between inputs and outputs, and complex decisions with trade-offs and uncertainty.\n\nGrounded in the author's own classroom approach to business statistics, the book reveals how to use data to understand the drivers of business outcomes, which in turn allows for data-driven business decisions. A basic, non-mathematical foundation in statistics is provided, outlining for readers the tools needed to link data with business decisions; account for uncertainty in the actions of others and in patterns revealed by data; handle data in Excel; translate their analysis into simple business terms; and present results in simple tables and charts. The author discusses key data analytic frameworks, such as decision trees and multiple regression, and also explores additional topics, including:\n\nUse of the Excel functions Solver and Goal Seek\nPartial correlation and auto-correlation\nInteractions and proportional variation in regression models\nSeasonal adjustment and what it reveals\nBasic portfolio theory as an introduction to correlations\n\nChapters are introduced with case studies that integrate simple ideas into the larger business context, and are followed by further details, raw data, and motivating insights. Algebraic notation is used only when necessary, and throughout the book, the author utilizes real-world examples from diverse areas such as market surveys, finance, economics, and business ethics. Excel add-ins StatproGo and TreePlan are showcased to demonstrate execution of the techniques, and a related website features extensive programming instructions as well as insights, data sets, and solutions to problems included in the material. The enclosed CD contains the complete book in electronic format, including all presented data, supplemental material on the discussed case files, and links to exercises and solutions.\n\nData Driven Business Decisions is an excellent book for MBA quantitative analysis courses or undergraduate general statistics courses. It also serves as a valuable reference for practicing MBAs and practitioners in the fields of statistics, business, and finance.","tags":["Data","Data Science","Business Intelligence"]},{"id":"9781800569621","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Supercharge your Slack Productivity","authors":["Moshe Markovich"],"pages":"300","publication_date":"April 2021","description":"\"Supercharge your Slack Productivity\" is a comprehensive guide to mastering Slack for enhancing team collaboration and workflow automation.

Others are more difficult. And then there are situations that seem completely hopeless. Conflict is escalating, people are getting aggressive, and no one is willing to back down. And to top it off, you have little power or other resources to work with. Harvard professor and negotiation adviser Deepak Malhotra shows how to defuse even the most potentially explosive situations and to find success when things seem impossible.Malhotra identifies three broad approaches for breaking deadlocks and resolving conflicts, and draws out scores of actionable lessons using behind-the-scenes stories of fascinating real-life negotiations, including drafting of the US Constitution, resolving the Cuban Missile Crisis, ending bitter disputes in the NFL and NHL, and beating the odds in complex business situations. But he also shows how these same principles and tactics can be applied in everyday life, whether you are making corporate deals, negotiating job offers, resolving business disputes, tackling obstacles in personal relationships, or even negotiating with children.As Malhotra reminds us, regardless of the context or which issues are on the table, negotiation is always, fundamentally, about human interaction. No matter how high the stakes or how protracted the dispute, the object of negotiation is to engage with other human beings in a way that leads to better understandings and agreements. The principles and strategies in this book will help you do this more effectively in every situation.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Business Negotiation"]},{"id":"9781118641316","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"The Ultimate Book of Influence: 10 Tools of Persuasion to Connect, Communicate, and Win in Business","authors":["Chris Helder"],"pages":"224","publication_date":"July 2013","description":"Master the power of influence and persuasion to achieve more in work and life\n\nFor business leaders and managers, as well as those who work in sales, the power of influence can be a potent advantage.

ICT outages, cyber attacks, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, pandemics, supply chain failures and other unexpected events can all affect productivity and in many cases place a company’s survival in serious jeopardy.\n\nBusiness continuity planning is essential to overcoming business disruptions, but too many companies prepare business continuity plans and then shelve them, only for those plans to fail when they’re actually needed.\n\n80% of companies that have not recovered from a disaster within one month go out of business.\n\nA business continuity plan that isn’t validated isn’t a plan at all – it’s merely a strategy. Indeed, in some cases an untested plan is worse than no plan at all. In spite of this, only 30% of businesses actually validate their business continuity plans.\n\nProduct overview\n\nBusiness continuity planning is a process of continual improvement, not a matter of writing a plan and then putting your feet up. Attempting to validate every aspect of your plan, however – particularly in a live rehearsal situation – could create a disaster of your own making.Validating Your Business Continuity Plan examines the three essential components of validating a business continuity plan – exercising, maintenance and review – and outlines a controlled and systematic approach to BCP validation while considering each component, covering methods and techniques such as table-top reviews, workshops, and live rehearsals.\n\nThe book also takes account of industry standards and guidelines to help steer the reader through the validation process, including the international standard ISO 22301 and the Business Continuity Institute’s Good Practice Guidelines.\n\nIn addition, it provides a number of case studies based on the author’s considerable experience – some of them successful, others less so – to highlight common pitfalls and problems associated with the validation process.\n\nContents\n\nIntroductionStandards and guidelinesBusiness continuity begins at homeDefining your exercise programmeSelected scenariosLive rehearsal case studiesIt could happen to anyone, couldn't it?Maintaining your BCMSReviewing your BCMSPerformance appraisalUsing consultants to help you exerciseTraining and educationAdditional reference material\n\nAbout the author\n\nRobert A Clark is a fellow of the Institute of Business Continuity Management, a fellow of the British Computer Society, a member of the Business Continuity Institute and an Approved BCI Instructor.

This book gives you all the information you need to get started.\n\n\"Smart home\" devices are everywhere these days—you can buy internet-connected light bulbs, thermostats, door locks, sensors, and dozens of other products. But these devices aren't very smart on their own. Apple's HomeKit platform offers a way to integrate, monitor, control, and automate smart home devices from a wide variety of manufacturers. Using the built-in Home app on a Mac or iOS/iPadOS device (perhaps along with third-party apps), you can connect to your various smart devices, see what they're up to, control them, and even get them to operate on a schedule or respond to changing conditions in your home automatically.\n\nEven with HomeKit, however, home automation can be a daunting prospect. That's why Josh Centers wrote Take Control of Apple Home Automation. The book walks you carefully through every step of the process, showing you how you can start with a basic system that costs less than $50 and work your way up to as much complexity as you want or need. And you don't have to be a computer geek to simplify and improve your life with HomeKit-compatible products. Even if you don't know a wire nut from a macadamia or which end of a screwdriver to stick in a socket (spoiler: neither!), Josh's thorough advice will enable you to work wonders in your home.\n\nIn this book, you'll learn:\n\nThe most common home automation myths (and why you shouldn't worry about them)\nHow to choose HomeKit-compatible devices that meet your needs, and which products you might want to avoid\nExactly what HomeKit is, what it does, how it works, and what its limitations are\nWhy you need a hub (in the form of an Apple TV, HomePod, or iPad) and how to set it up\nImportant safety rules for working with electrical products, especially those that require wiring\nHow to install advanced accessories such as a smart switch, thermostat, or door/window sensor—including illustrated, step-by-step instructions\nWhat Apple's Home app for Mac and iOS/iPadOS does—and how to configure homes, zones, rooms, accessories, services, and scenes\nTips for controlling your smart home using a Mac, iOS/iPadOS device, Apple Watch, HomePod, or Siri\nWays to automate your smart home using schedules, sensors, geofencing, and other tools (without making your house seem haunted)\nThe best ways to troubleshoot home automation problems\n\nThis book was sponsored by Elgato (the original makers of the Eve line of HomeKit devices, which spun off into a separate company in 2018), so many of the examples feature Eve products, although nearly all the advice in the book is applicable to HomeKit products from any manufacturer. (You'll also read about working with Philips Hue bulbs, ecobee thermostats, and numerous other devices.)\n\nIf you're an Apple user who's interested in joining the smart home revolution—or adding even more smarts to your existing setup—this book is the ideal guide.","tags":["Business","Business / Personal Technology","Personal Software"]},{"id":"9781785886188","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Practical Predictive Analytics","authors":["Ralph Winters"],"pages":"576","publication_date":"June 2017","description":"Dive into the world of predictive analytics with 'Practical Predictive Analytics.'

Several com­mon management maxims — often taken for granted as truisms — are examined and debunked with evidence-based arguments. The constant repetition of these flawed tropes perpetuates their mythological status and limits personal and organizational performance. Eleven management maxims are rebuked using empirical data, original scholarship, literature reviews, field observations, and thoughtful opinions from numerous ex­perts. Far from a business as usual business book, Deconstructing Manage­ment Maxims has been researched with academic rigor yet written in an approachable style. Unafraid of taking on conventional business wisdom, it contains some controversial yet substantiated positions that will pro­voke critical thinking and debate. After all, sacred cows and long-believed tenets of management lore do not go away quietly. A clear message from this book is that you don’t have to believe everything you read or hear—be it in the classroom or at work! It offers a refreshing break from the constant drumbeat of dronish corporate and academic clichés. This book is best appreciated by readers wanting to think critically about important management phenomena.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Business Ethics"]},{"id":"9780596153588","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"iPhone Forensics","authors":["Jonathan Zdziarski"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"September 2008","description":"\"This book is a must for anyone attempting to examine the iPhone.

Brown"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"April 2007","description":"\"Like so many acronyms in public currency, SOA means many different things to different people. Paul Brown deftly avoids getting caught in the trap of overstating the case for SOA. Instead, he brings the topic skillfully into focus, zeroing in on the concepts that must be understood in order to be effective. Paul's purpose, as I've found so often in his presentations and conversations, is to get to the core of real-world architectural issues that make the difference between success and failure. Paul doesn't sit in an ivory tower pontificating; he gets right down to the critical issues in order to develop effective real-life strategies.\"\n\n--From the Foreword by Jonathan Mack, Senior Technical Architect, Guardian Life Insurance Company\n\n\"As Paul Brown explains in this fine book, there is more to software development than just writing code. Successful software requires deep thought and strategy. It requires the coordination and marshalling of the resources and intellect of the entire company, both business and IT. I learned much from reading his manuscript and heartily endorse the finished book.\"\n\n--Dr. Michael Blaha, author and industrial consultant\n\n\"Paul Brown has provided a practical and actionable guide that will illuminate the way for Business and IT Leaders involved in IT strategy, planning, architecture, and project management. A successful adoption of SOA will touch every aspect of the business and change the way IT does business. This book does a good job of describing the organizational challenges and risks and providing suggestions to manage them. It also dives deeply into the architectural techniques that can be employed in order to align the service architecture with the business, thus providing maximum benefit and continued funding for your SOA transformation.\"\n\n--Maja Tibbling, Lead Enterprise Architect, Con-way Enterprise Services\n\n\"Succeeding with SOAachieves where most books on service-oriented architectures fail. It accurately describes what practitioners are seeing, as well as why, and gives them practical examples through case studies and instruction. Most useful both for those about to take the plunge and those who are already soaking.\"\n\n--Charly Paelinck, Vice President, Development and Architecture, Harrah's Entertainment\n\n\"This book is a must-read for architects and SOA practitioners. It provides an important foundation for a SOA strategy. Brown emphasizes the importance of aligning services with their business processes, building capabilities using strong enterprise architecture standards, and ensuring an effective governance process. The book promotes the notion of mutual dependency between managing a business using business processes and managing its IT with SOA. By aligning the two paradigms, a business can become more agile, able to adapt to change both quickly and economically. This is the promise of SOA.\"\n\n--Sunny Tara, Director, IT, Enterprise Architecture and Services, Harrah's Entertainment\n\nGetting a Desired Business Return on Your Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) Investment\n\nToday, business processes and information systems are so tightly intertwined that they must be designed together, as parts of a total architecture, to realize enterprise goals. In Succeeding with SOA, Paul Brown shows how service-oriented architectures (SOAs) provide the best structure for such integration: clean, well-defined interfaces between collaborating entities. But even SOAs need to be correctly understood and implemented to avoid common failures. Drawing on decades of experience, Dr. Brown explains what business managers and IT architects absolutely need to know--including critical success factors--to undertake this essential work.\n\nCoverage includes\n\nSetting clear and reasonable expectations for SOA's benefits\n\nUnderstanding why conventional project management techniques don't scale to today's enterprise-wide projects\n\nDefining a living roadmap for developing services based on business priorities\n\nEstablishing coherent leadership that brings together business executives, IT leaders, and the SOA architecture group\n\nUsing Total Architecture Synthesis (TAS) to rapidly develop business processes and information systems together\n\nUnderstanding the central role of architecture--and making sure the right architectural decisions get made\n\nWhether you're a business or technical leader, this book will help you plan, organize, and execute SOA initiatives that meet or exceed their goals--now, and for years to come.\n\nList of Figures List of Tables ForewordPreface  PART I.

IPT operates as a seamlessly integrated front end to ISPF. Note the following points:\n\nIPT functionality is available from any panel, without a need to modify any ISPF Primary Options Menu. All IPT functions are totally integrated. IPT can perform almost any activity within ISPF, or internally invoke the function that can perform the task.\n\nIPT combines separately provided ISPF utility functions and new ISPF Productivity Tool features into the Object List (OLIST) and Member Selection List (MSL). The resulting members, datasets, and Object Lists become powerful platforms where you can perform many tasks without navigating to other utilities.\n\nIPT relates objects to applications in a similar manner to the way that a PC performs Object Linking and Embedding (OLE). By extending the dataset objects that are used by ISPF to other object classes, IPT lets you specify the object to be processed and the action that is performed (such as EDIT or BROWSE). The facility that is appropriate to the object class for the action that you have requested is invoked automatically.\n\nIPT provides extensive search capabilities that are both rapid and intuitive. You can easily search for volumes, datasets, members, and text within members. ISPF Productivity Tool also furnishes automatic drill-down system navigation to examine volumes, datasets, and members.\n\nIPT provides a menu-driven facility to display and recover all of the deleted members of a partitioned dataset (PDS) library.\n\nIPT extends the ISPF action bar with options that provide access to new functionality so that you do not have to learn new commands or syntax. In addition to the ISPF Point-and-Shoot capabilities, IPT provides new concepts, such as hotbars (user-defined fields that execute commands), field-sensitive areas in MSLs and OLISTs, automatic recognition of a dataset name on any ISPF panel as a parameter to BROWSE, EDIT, or VIEW, or parameters within any Time Sharing Option (TSO) command.\n\nIPT provides integrated and enhanced IBM Software Configuration and Library Manager (SCLM) support within the standard member and dataset lists. SCLM is a source library management component of ISPF that provides change control, multiple source versions, auditing, a built-in make facility, and automatic check-in/sign-out using standard libraries (PDS and partitioned dataset extended (PDSE)). IPT includes built-in interfaces to various IBM and ISV products.\n\nIPT includes a new batch utility that provides a seamlessly integrated front end to the IBM IEBCOPY utility. In addition to supporting all IEBCOPY standard functionality, it includes additional major enhancements.\n\nThis book is intended as a supplement to existing product manuals. It opens with an overview of the main IPT concepts and facilities, and follows with detailed chapters which are each dedicated to a major IPT function. Practical scenarios, accompanied by window captures and coding examples, demonstrate how both experienced ISPF users and those new to the IBM z/OS environment can benefit from the IPT enhanced functionality in each case.","tags":["Business","Business / Personal Technology"]},{"id":"9780814417010","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"The Anatomy of Persuasion","authors":["Norbert Aubuchon"],"pages":"208","publication_date":"June 2007","description":"Some people seem to be able to talk anybody into anything!

And Microsoft has greatly improved and enhanced Office 2004 to take advantage of the latest Mac OX features. In short, Microsoft Office for the Mac is wildly popular and better than ever. But as incredible and powerful it is, the Office 2004 suite comes without a single page of printed instructions. That means you're left to forge your own path through its countless innovative and useful new features and tools--until now. Office 2004 for Mac: The Missing Manual is the manual that should have been in the box. It's the map that clearly and easily guides both beginners and veterans through this new suite. Mark H. Walker, Franklin Tessler, and Paul Berkowitz deliver all the practical information you need to master the basics and make the most of all four Office 2004 programs--Word, Excel, Powerpoint, and Entourage. It's four books in one! According to Microsoft's own research, the average Office user taps into less than fifteen percent of the suite's features. With first-rate writing, a handcrafted index, and the trademark humor and clarity of every Missing Manual, Office 2004 for Mac: The Missing Manual will change that. Because this isn't an authorized book, Walker, Tessler, and Berkowitz candidly point out which features are gems in the rough worthy of your focused attention--and which are junkware that you best continue to overlook.

Brown"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"April 2007","description":"\"Like so many acronyms in public currency, SOA means many different things to different people. Paul Brown deftly avoids getting caught in the trap of overstating the case for SOA. Instead, he brings the topic skillfully into focus, zeroing in on the concepts that must be understood in order to be effective. Paul's purpose, as I've found so often in his presentations and conversations, is to get to the core of real-world architectural issues that make the difference between success and failure. Paul doesn't sit in an ivory tower pontificating; he gets right down to the critical issues in order to develop effective real-life strategies.\"\n\n--From the Foreword by Jonathan Mack, Senior Technical Architect, Guardian Life Insurance Company\n\n\"As Paul Brown explains in this fine book, there is more to software development than just writing code. Successful software requires deep thought and strategy. It requires the coordination and marshalling of the resources and intellect of the entire company, both business and IT. I learned much from reading his manuscript and heartily endorse the finished book.\"\n\n--Dr. Michael Blaha, author and industrial consultant\n\n\"Paul Brown has provided a practical and actionable guide that will illuminate the way for Business and IT Leaders involved in IT strategy, planning, architecture, and project management. A successful adoption of SOA will touch every aspect of the business and change the way IT does business. This book does a good job of describing the organizational challenges and risks and providing suggestions to manage them. It also dives deeply into the architectural techniques that can be employed in order to align the service architecture with the business, thus providing maximum benefit and continued funding for your SOA transformation.\"\n\n--Maja Tibbling, Lead Enterprise Architect, Con-way Enterprise Services\n\n\"Succeeding with SOAachieves where most books on service-oriented architectures fail. It accurately describes what practitioners are seeing, as well as why, and gives them practical examples through case studies and instruction. Most useful both for those about to take the plunge and those who are already soaking.\"\n\n--Charly Paelinck, Vice President, Development and Architecture, Harrah's Entertainment\n\n\"This book is a must-read for architects and SOA practitioners. It provides an important foundation for a SOA strategy. Brown emphasizes the importance of aligning services with their business processes, building capabilities using strong enterprise architecture standards, and ensuring an effective governance process. The book promotes the notion of mutual dependency between managing a business using business processes and managing its IT with SOA. By aligning the two paradigms, a business can become more agile, able to adapt to change both quickly and economically. This is the promise of SOA.\"\n\n--Sunny Tara, Director, IT, Enterprise Architecture and Services, Harrah's Entertainment\n\nGetting a Desired Business Return on Your Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) Investment\n\nToday, business processes and information systems are so tightly intertwined that they must be designed together, as parts of a total architecture, to realize enterprise goals. In Succeeding with SOA, Paul Brown shows how service-oriented architectures (SOAs) provide the best structure for such integration: clean, well-defined interfaces between collaborating entities. But even SOAs need to be correctly understood and implemented to avoid common failures. Drawing on decades of experience, Dr. Brown explains what business managers and IT architects absolutely need to know--including critical success factors--to undertake this essential work.\n\nCoverage includes\n\nSetting clear and reasonable expectations for SOA's benefits\n\nUnderstanding why conventional project management techniques don't scale to today's enterprise-wide projects\n\nDefining a living roadmap for developing services based on business priorities\n\nEstablishing coherent leadership that brings together business executives, IT leaders, and the SOA architecture group\n\nUsing Total Architecture Synthesis (TAS) to rapidly develop business processes and information systems together\n\nUnderstanding the central role of architecture--and making sure the right architectural decisions get made\n\nWhether you're a business or technical leader, this book will help you plan, organize, and execute SOA initiatives that meet or exceed their goals--now, and for years to come.\n\nList of Figures List of Tables ForewordPreface  PART I.

IPT operates as a seamlessly integrated front end to ISPF. Note the following points:\n\nIPT functionality is available from any panel, without a need to modify any ISPF Primary Options Menu. All IPT functions are totally integrated. IPT can perform almost any activity within ISPF, or internally invoke the function that can perform the task.\n\nIPT combines separately provided ISPF utility functions and new ISPF Productivity Tool features into the Object List (OLIST) and Member Selection List (MSL). The resulting members, datasets, and Object Lists become powerful platforms where you can perform many tasks without navigating to other utilities.\n\nIPT relates objects to applications in a similar manner to the way that a PC performs Object Linking and Embedding (OLE). By extending the dataset objects that are used by ISPF to other object classes, IPT lets you specify the object to be processed and the action that is performed (such as EDIT or BROWSE). The facility that is appropriate to the object class for the action that you have requested is invoked automatically.\n\nIPT provides extensive search capabilities that are both rapid and intuitive. You can easily search for volumes, datasets, members, and text within members. ISPF Productivity Tool also furnishes automatic drill-down system navigation to examine volumes, datasets, and members.\n\nIPT provides a menu-driven facility to display and recover all of the deleted members of a partitioned dataset (PDS) library.\n\nIPT extends the ISPF action bar with options that provide access to new functionality so that you do not have to learn new commands or syntax. In addition to the ISPF Point-and-Shoot capabilities, IPT provides new concepts, such as hotbars (user-defined fields that execute commands), field-sensitive areas in MSLs and OLISTs, automatic recognition of a dataset name on any ISPF panel as a parameter to BROWSE, EDIT, or VIEW, or parameters within any Time Sharing Option (TSO) command.\n\nIPT provides integrated and enhanced IBM Software Configuration and Library Manager (SCLM) support within the standard member and dataset lists. SCLM is a source library management component of ISPF that provides change control, multiple source versions, auditing, a built-in make facility, and automatic check-in/sign-out using standard libraries (PDS and partitioned dataset extended (PDSE)). IPT includes built-in interfaces to various IBM and ISV products.\n\nIPT includes a new batch utility that provides a seamlessly integrated front end to the IBM IEBCOPY utility. In addition to supporting all IEBCOPY standard functionality, it includes additional major enhancements.\n\nThis book is intended as a supplement to existing product manuals. It opens with an overview of the main IPT concepts and facilities, and follows with detailed chapters which are each dedicated to a major IPT function. Practical scenarios, accompanied by window captures and coding examples, demonstrate how both experienced ISPF users and those new to the IBM z/OS environment can benefit from the IPT enhanced functionality in each case.","tags":["Business","Business / Personal Technology"]},{"id":"9781947441668","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Counterintelligence for Corporate Environments, Volume I","authors":["Dylan van Genderen"],"pages":"130","publication_date":"April 2018","description":"Counterintelligence for Corporate Environments, Volume I provides the reader with unique, comprehensive, and efficient methodologies that will change and improve corporate security and operational models to the highest degree possible.

But as incredible and powerful it is, the Office 2004 suite comes without a single page of printed instructions. That means you're left to forge your own path through its countless innovative and useful new features and tools--until now.

It sees ethics as a necessary foundation for the social infrastructure that makes modern life possible, much as engineering is a foundation for physical infrastructure. It is not wedded to any particular ethical philosophy but draws from several traditions to construct a unified and principled approach to ethical reasoning. Rather than follow the common academic practice of seeking a reflective equilibrium of moral intuitions and principles, it builds on a few bedrock principles of rational thought that serve as criteria for valid argumentation. It develops the ideas from the ground up, without presupposing any background in ethics or philosophy.\n\nEpistemologically, the book views ethics as parallel to mathematics, in that it relies on generally accepted proof techniques to establish results. Whereas mathematics rests on such proof paradigms as mathematical induction and proof by contradiction, ethics can be seen as relying on proof by applying consistency tests, such as generalizability and respect for autonomy. Utilitarianism also plays a key role, but it is reconceived as a deontological criterion. This approach obviously requires that these criteria be formulated more rigorously than is normally the case. To accomplish this, the book begins with the classical idea that an action is distinguishable from mere behavior by virtue of its having a coherent rationale, where coherence requires passing certain consistency tests such as generalizability. An action is therefore inseparable from its rationale, and generalizability is defined in terms of consistency with the rationale. A utilitarian criterion receives a similar treatment with respect to a means-end rationale. Respect for autonomy is grounded in a carefully developed action theory that takes into account such concepts as joint autonomy, implied consent, and the permissibility of interference with unethical behavior. It provides an account of responsibility that is both practical and theoretically satisfying, and it yields a novel solution of the much-discussed trolley car dilemmas.\n\nThe book is written for a general audience and strives to be as readable and engaging as possible, while maintaining rigor. It begins by dispelling a raft of misconceptions that trivialize ethics and block its development as an essential tool of modern life, such as the notion that ethics is just a matter of opinion without rational foundation. After presenting the ethical principles just described, along with many examples, it provides several chapters that analyze real-life dilemmas, many obtained from the author’s students and professional workshop participants. One cannot understand physics or chemistry without seeing how their principles are applied to real problems, and the same is true of ethics. These chapters demonstrate that a unified normative theory can deal with a wide range of real cases while achieving a reasonable level of objectivity and rigor.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Business Ethics"]},{"id":"9781681983608","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"The Enthusiast's Guide to iPhone Photography","authors":["Seán Duggan"],"pages":"244","publication_date":"September 2018","description":"If you’re a passionate photographer and you’re ready to take your work to the next level, The Enthusiast’s Guide book series was created just for you.

There are basically two types of iPhone books out there: (1) The “tell-me-all-about-it” kind, which includes in-depth discussions on everything from wireless network protocols to advanced compression codes. (2) Then there’s this book, which instead is a “show-me-how-to-do-it” book that skips all the confusing techno-jargon and just tells you, in plain, simple English, exactly how to use the iPhone features you want to use most.The iPhone Book is from Scott Kelby, the award-winning author of the smash bestseller, The iPod Book. Scott takes that same highly acclaimed, casual, straight-to-the-point concept and layout and brings it to learning Apple’s amazing iPhone. Scott teams up once again with gadget guru and leading iPhone authority Terry White to put together a book that is an awful lot like the iPhone itself–simple to use and fun to learn. The book’s layout is brilliant, with each page covering just one single topic, so finding the information you need is quick and easy, with a large full-color photo on each page so you can see exactly how it works.The first edition of this book was named Best Computer Book of 2007 and, since then, Scott and Terry have added even more tips and tricks, and made it even easier by focusing on just the most useful and most requested iPhone 4S, 4, and 3GS features (without all the techno-babble), so you can start really using your iPhone today!","tags":["Business","Business / Personal Technology","Personal Devices","Mobile Devices / Computers","iPhone"]},{"id":"9781449632618","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Business of Sports, 2nd Edition","authors":["Scott Rosner","Kenneth L.

Like the meteor that likely precipitated the end of the dinosaurs, Social is the catalyst in an extinction event--and business as we know it has changed forever. A World Gone Social offers an eye-opening look at fundamental and powerful changes the social collaboration era has set in motion: ● Customers now have the power--just watch what happens as more realize it! ● With increased transparency, businesses must be more ethical--no more pretending ● Command-and-control leadership is now so inefficient, it is a liability ● Nimble and small is the new competitive advantage--few corporations are capable of the agility required by evolving marketplaces ● Recruiting is now a two-way proposition, with job seekers able to peer behind the corporate curtain ● Relationship and community-building is how customers and brand ambassadors are won--and retained ● Engagement--with partners, employees, and customers--is not a luxury; it is a requirement. Each chapter provides compelling stories and concrete examples of companies demonstrating enlightened business practices and doing Social right--and some that are not--and the lessons to be learned from their experiences. Finally, readers will discover how to objectively assess the fit ness of their own company's culture and social presence...so they may successfully transition from a 20th- to a 21st-century \"social\" organization.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Business Ethics"]},{"id":"9780470625866","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Prezi™ For Dummies®","authors":["Stephanie Diamond"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"September 2010","description":"A one-stop resource for an exciting new Web-based, slide-free presentation tool!\n\nPeople who have been seeking a flashier version of PowerPoint have found it—and it's Prezi.

It is designed to be a provocative piece, but one that solidifies the intellectual framework around an emerging concept--strategic CSR.The foundation for these principles comes from my perspective as a management professor within the business school. As such, it is a pragmatic philosophy, oriented around stakeholder theory, that is designed to persuade business leaders who are skeptical of existing definitions and organizing principles of CSR, sustainability, or business ethics. It is also designed to stimulate thought within the community of intellectuals and business school administrators committed to these issues, but who approach them from more traditional perspectives. Ultimately, therefore, the purpose of the strategic CSR concept (and this book) is radical--it aims to redefine both business education and business practice. By building a theory that defines CSR as core to business operations and value creation (as opposed to peripheral practices that can be marginalized within the firm), these defining principles become applicable across the range of operational functions. As such, they redefine how businesses approach these functions in practice, but also redefine how these subjects should be taught in business schools.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Business Architecture"]},{"id":"0642572027001","language":"en","level":"Intermediate","title":"Dive Into DAX - FILTER","authors":["Chennel Williams"],"publication_date":"July 2024","description":"This video series is all about learning to use Power BI, a Microsoft tool that helps you to turn data into valuable insights.

Genius icons present smart or innovative ways to do something; in many cases, this will be a way that readers can save time or hassle. A smaller trim size makes it handy, but also easy for readers to find essential information and tips for their iPad.","tags":["Business","Business / Personal Technology","Personal Devices","Mobile Devices / Computers"]},{"id":"9781119265313","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Office 365 For Dummies, 2nd Edition","authors":["Ken Withee","Jennifer Reed"],"pages":"336","publication_date":"May 2016","description":"Collaborate on documents in real time\n\nUtilize social networking in your daily tasks\n\nIncrease productivity and grow your business\n\nCreate a virtual office anywhere\n\nIf you want to get your head in the cloud and get up to speed on the features in Office 365, you've come to the right place.

Version 3.1, updated November 23, 2021\n\nThis book covers everything someone needs to know about configuring an Apple ID account, interactions with iCloud-based services, and troubleshooting account access.\n\nYour Apple ID is much more than a simple username. It's a key that unlocks a long list of Apple products and services on any of numerous devices. iCloud uses an Apple ID, as does Apple Music; the App Store; the Music, TV, and Books apps; and more. An Apple ID protects your personal information, including email and iOS/iPadOS backups; helps you find a lost iPhone; and can even unlock your Mac. So it goes without saying that if something goes wrong with your Apple ID, you could be in for a world of hurt.\n\nUnfortunately, things go wrong with Apple IDs all the time. Fortunately, Glenn Fleishman, a veteran technology journalist and the author of Macworld's \"Mac 911\" column, is ready to help with expert advice on how to manage your Apple ID—including how to prevent, solve, or work around most common problems!\n\nIn this book, Glenn answers questions like:\n\nWhat all is my Apple ID used for?\nHow does my iCloud account relate to my Apple ID?\nWhat problems can two-factor authentication (2FA) solve, and how do I use it?\nAre there other mechanisms I can use to ensure that I can recover an Apple ID in the event of a problem? (Spoiler: yes!)\nWhat if I have a device that's too old to work with two-factor authentication?\nWhat should I do if I have two or more Apple IDs or iCloud accounts?\nWill I lose access to all my Apple media purchases if I move to another country?\nCan I share an Apple ID with someone else?\nWhat exactly should I do if I think someone is hacking my Apple ID account?\nHow can I recover a forgotten Apple ID password?\nWhat steps should I take if Apple locks me out of my account?\nIf I lose access to an email address associated with my Apple ID, what can I do?\nWhat Apple ID changes in iOS 15/iPadOS 15 and macOS 12 Monterey do I need to know about?\nHow does \"Sign in with Apple\" work?\nHow can I use Family Sharing to share data and purchases within my family?\nWhat types of subscriptions can I manage with my Apple ID, and how?\nWhich payment methods can I associate with my Apple ID, and how do I manage them?\n\nAnd that's just the beginning. Glenn has packed a remarkable amount of concise problem-solving information into this compact, 136-page book. Read it before you encounter Apple ID problems to minimize your risk, and if you've already encountered a problem, read it to find the best path to a rapid solution.","tags":["Business","Business / Personal Technology","iCloud"]},{"id":"9781491905098","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Galaxy S5: The Missing Manual","authors":["Preston Gralla"],"pages":"458","publication_date":"July 2014","description":"Get the most out of Samsung’s Galaxy S5 smartphone right from the start.

It gives a real “how to” look to assist management and operations personnel to analyze their operations in a program of continuous improvements and on-going search for best practices so that each entity operates most economically, efficiently, and effectively—tied into why the entity is in existence in the first place. Best practice techniques assist the company in identifying its critical problem areas and treating the cause and not the symptom. With sensible business principles as the hallmark for the company’s quest for best practices, the company can be clear as to the direction of movement and avoid merely improving poor practices or matching competitors’ less than desirable practices—that is, being less inefficient than competitors. Clear business principles that make sense to all levels of the organization allow the company to identify and develop the proper best practices. In this manner, everyone in the organization is moving in the same desired direction—and singing from the same songbook. The viruses that corrupt a business organization can be widespread and quite contagious.

As a result, a working knowledge of concepts such as the triple bottom line and sustainability, have become mandatory. Systems-thinking is foundational for grasping these concepts and is based on trans-disciplinary theories deriving in part from biology, physics, economics, philosophy, computer science, engineering, geography, and other sciences. Specifically it is the study of systems, including all life forms, climate phenomena, and even in human learning and organizational processes, that regulate themselves through feedback.\n\nThe media and the public have become savvy to corporate green-washing, and government regulation, already pervasive in Europe, is imminent in the United States. Business practices are a subsystem of human activity, which is itself a subsystem of the biosphere we all depend upon for services, such as clean air and water, sufficient soils to produce food, and moderate weather. Corporate sustainability practices are in the midst of becoming a required aspect of the social license to conduct business, and the use of a systems framework provides a coherent and eminently sensible way to comprehend the structure and logic that underlies this transition.\n\nGreen business efforts and stakeholder initiatives undertaken by those without the requisite understanding of sustainability and the trends related to it in the world of commerce risk adverse press, activist pressure, regulatory constraint, added expense, reduced revenue, and lowered valuation.\n\nThis book offers a practical, relevant, and easily grasped overview of sustainability issues and the systems logic that informs them, supported by empirical research and applied to corporate rationales, decision-making, and business processes. Intended for business professionals seeking concise, reliable, and current knowledge and trends, it will support them in leading their organizations' corporate sustainability, social responsibility, and citizenship efforts so they can remain competitive and successful.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Business Ethics"]},{"id":"9781606490969","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"A Primer on Negotiating Corporate Purchase Contracts","authors":["Assitant Professor Patrick C.

This book provides unique insights into the experience of seasoned academics who embed business ethics in teaching management theory and practice. Its multidisciplinary approach enriches its content, since the insights of our colleagues from within their fields are invaluable. It therefore complements other business textbooks. After general themes (curriculum integration, adult learning, learner commitment, and generation Y classrooms), this volume covers ethics and responsibility in people management, team building, change management; operations management, business law, and digital marketing communications.The book provides a platform to share experiences of teaching ethical profitability. It contributes to resolving concerns experienced when faculty wish to incorporate ethics into their teaching but feel they lack preparation or ideas on how to do it.

Valeh Nazemoff has written an excellent book with a commonsense approach and clear guidance.\" —Shaun Khalfan, Chief of Cyber Infrastructure, Department of the Navy\n\nA new pragmatic synthesis of organizational psychology, business analytics, and multiple intelligences theory, The Four Intelligences of the Business Mind lays out a scheme of four discrete but interlocking types of intelligence essential to business success. These intelligences are scalable and transferable from the individual leader to the organizational ecosystem. This short book teaches executives first to analyze and train their own brains in these four intelligences; then to transform their organizations by applying their sharpened quadruplex intelligence to their business analyses and decisions; and finally to train and incentivize their companies to map onto a collective organizational scale the mental transformation modeled by the \"mastermind\" leader.\n\nThe four essential business intelligences identified by IT executive and organizational psychologist Valeh Nazemoff are financial intelligence, customer intelligence, data intelligence, and mastermind intelligence. Financial intelligence informs your ability to reinvest and regrow your business boldly but prudently in the light of predictive, risk, and business analytics. Customer intelligence informs your ability to rethink your approaches to attracting and keeping customers using customer, web, mobile, social, big data, and behavioral analytics. Data intelligence informs your ability to reinvent and recreate information in automated graphical representations to enable rapid decision-making using visual, cloud, web, and operational analytics, AI, and distance collaboration platforms. Finally, mastermind intelligence involves your ability through leadership and team exercises to impart to your employees and organization the same transformative honing and integration of business intelligences as you have undergone yourself.\n\n\"Practical, relevant, insightful, engaging, and a pleasant read, The Four Intelligences of the Business Mind puts human decision making into a whole new light, revealing practical steps that will allow you to reinvent your business and customer relationships!\" —James Brady, PhD, FHIMSS, Chief Information Officer, Kaiser Permanente Orange County\n\n\"An invaluable book that shows you how to harness the inevitable transformations in business by understanding your mind better.\" —Alan Komet, Vice President, Global Sales Operations, FalconStor Software, Inc.\n\n\"A must-read book for every business person.\" —Chuck Corjay, Ret.

A deep exploration of the concept of reputation, the ways in which it can suffer, and the consequences when it does, the book outlines an ethics controls framework that can mitigate risk and improve business performance. Readers will learn how to identify and manage weaknesses, and how to institute a system of governance that embeds proper, ethical conduct into the corporate culture. A clear set of controls and procedures provides actionable instruction that can be customised to suit the organisational structure, and discussion of historical and international ethics provides the context for implementation. Case studies illustrate the real-world applications, while interviews with executives from a variety of sectors provide important practical insights into some of the key issues discussed in the book.\n\nThe law regulates behaviour in health and safety and financial crime, but otherwise, conduct is largely determined by the culture, ethics and values of an organisation. Effective reputation management is complex, and often difficult to achieve, as much of the available information on the topic is more theoretical than practical.

It's time for something new.\n\nAlmost everything is negotiable. Almost every interaction is a negotiation. And in no field is this clearer than in business, where every day we work with others to get things done. But when we have real differences, is win-win always possible? Or must every negotiation be a zero-sum battle, with a winner and a loser?\n\nOver the last half century, two opposing philosophies have ruled the field of negotiation: the win-lose, tooth-and-nail approach of training guru Chester Karrass; and the win-win, \"principled\" creed of Getting to Yes, developed by Roger Fisher and William Ury. But neither approach fully meets the challenge of today's volatile, disruptive, ultracompetitive business environment, where strategic problem-solving is of critical importance.\n\nIn Creative Conflict, negotiation experts Bill Sanders and Frank Mobus provide something new. They use a dynamic, dialectical approach to show how negotiations are driven by competition and cooperation at the same time. Counterintuitively, they reveal that conflict lies at the heart of more profitable agreements. They believe that when we tiptoe around conflict, we negotiate in a half-hearted way that limits our results. By contrast, creative negotiators probe and push until they hit a wall of disagreement, and then they figure out how to get past it. The authors construct a clear and useful framework based on three distinct negotiating contexts: Bargaining, Creative Dealmaking, and Relationship Building. They instruct readers on how to skillfully pursue their fair share while simultaneously seeking ways to expand a deal's scope and value for both sides.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Business Negotiation"]},{"id":"9780470500972","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Beginning iPhone® SDK Programming with Objective-C®","authors":["Wei-Meng Lee"],"pages":"542","publication_date":"January 2010","description":"Everything you need to know to start creating native applications for the iPhone and iPod Touch\n\nThe iPhone SDK and the Xcode tools are the official Apple tools used for creating native iPhone applications.

We've traveled far and fast from the old world of business ethics, where black-and-white concerns about bribery and fraud could be addressed via rules and processes. Simply maximizing shareholder value while not breaking the law is no longer a tenable approach, but we've never been so confused about what it means to do the right thing—and why it's so important.\n\nIn this eye-opening, essential book, NYU Stern ethics professor Alison Taylor argues that amid stakeholder demands and transparency pressures, we can no longer treat ethics as merely a legal and reputational defense mechanism. Leaders at Davos and the Business Roundtable have called for a new corporate responsibility paradigm, but organizations struggle to implement these ideas in an atmosphere of heightened expectations and intense suspicion. Offering vivid stories and examples from years working in anti-corruption and advising companies on ethics, Taylor brings this complex, risky environment alive to provide a blueprint for how leaders can rethink and reshape their practices. How can CEOs cut through the noise to set robust environmental and social priorities? When should they speak out on contentious social and political issues—and how? What does it really take to build a healthy organizational culture? How are we to approach corporate values when society itself is so divided?\n\nHigher Ground shows leaders how business can navigate this messy paradigm shift, build trust, and achieve long-term strategic advantage in a turbulent world.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Business Ethics"]},{"id":"9780321637949","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Apple Training Series: iWork ’09","authors":["Richard Harrington"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"March 2009","description":"In the only Apple-certified guide to iWork ’09, you’ll learn to create everything from first-rate business presentations and newsletters to effective budgets and event planners.

What worked before may not apply in the future. The authors acknowledge that asking “what if” questions about the future may create discomfort. Asking such questions forces people to step back and challenge current assumptions.\n\nIn the authors’ view, the questions leaders pose can prevent them from solving the right problem or seeing more innovative solutions. Leaders are often too narrow or overly protective of the current business or assume that the old habits, business models and regulations will remain intact. This article builds on the authors’ new book, Winning the Long Game: How Strategic Leaders Shape the Future. It encourages leaders to examine their businesses from multiple perspectives: to think “outside in”; to explore future scenarios; to be contrarian; to look for patterns; to create new options; and to learn from failure. Drawing on examples from companies including Google, Tesla Motors, Pixar, Netflix and DuPont, the authors discuss six questions:\n\n•How well do you understand the implications of broad market trends and less visible undercurrents for your business and for upcoming strategic choices?\n\n•How thoroughly have you analyzed major external uncertainties and future scenarios that could significantly impact your business decisions?\n\n•Do you regularly seek out diverse views to see multiple sides of complex issues, and do you purposely explore important problems from several angles?\n\n•Do you deploy multiple lenses to connect dots from diverse sources and stakeholders, and do you delve deep to see important connections that others miss?\n\n•Do you generate and evaluate multiple options when making a strategic decision, and do you consider the risks of each, including unintended consequences?\n\n•Do you encourage experiments and “failing fast” as a source of innovation and quick learning?","tags":["Data","Data Science","Business Intelligence","Microsoft Power Platform","Power BI"]},{"id":"9780470889633","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Knight's Microsoft® Business Intelligence 24-Hour Trainer: Leveraging Microsoft SQL Server® Integration, Analysis, and Reporting Services with Excel® and SharePoint®","authors":["Brian Knight","Devin Knight","Adam Jorgensen"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"September 2010","description":"A book-and-video introduction to Microsoft's Business Intelligence tools\n\nIf you are just starting to get a handle on Microsoft Business Intelligence (BI) tools, this book and accompanying video provides you with the just the right amount of information to perform basic business analysis and reporting.

The author discusses some such business models, namely, social business, compassionate business, microfinance-based business, cooperative business, bottom- of- the- pyramid business, and social welfare business. The common point of all these business models is that they alleviate poverty and promote social development in a self-sustaining manner. The text identifies the main principles followed by these business models and suggests principles of benevolent business. Thus gives an idea about how to design a successful benevolent business. The author argues that along with the government and the NGOs, which are presently expected to meet the social developmental needs of the people, benevolent businesses should be promoted for fulfilling the social developmental needs.

In Take Control of Calendar and Reminders, Mac expert Scholle McFarland helps you get the most out of these apps, showing you how to customize them, sync data across devices, and share meeting invitations and reminder lists. You’ll also learn how to use Siri as a shortcut, and how to fix common problems.\n\nIn the days before personal computers and mobile devices, we had to rely on paper calendars and to-do lists to help us organize our time and activities. Now, we have powerful tools, like Apple’s Calendar and Reminders, that are much more responsive to our needs. Put an event on your schedule, invite others to join, or set yourself an alarm (or more than one). Or, keep a list of to-do items, add to it and view it on all your Apple devices, and share your list with family or friends.\n\nIn this book, veteran Mac journalist and editor Scholle McFarland will guide you through getting to know these incredibly helpful apps, including lesser-known (but handy) features. For example, did you know that in Calendar you can set an alert for when you need to leave for an event, based on the travel time calculated using the location you entered for the event? Or that Reminders can prompt you to do something not only at a certain time, but also once you’ve reached a specific destination, like the grocery store?\n\nIf you’ve never taken the opportunity to explore Calendar and Reminders, this book will show you how to make them an important part of your daily routine. If you’ve already been using Calendar and Reminders, you’ll learn how to use them more effectively, troubleshoot common problems, and delve deeper into their capabilities.\n\nThis fully revised third edition is now fully up to date with Big Sur and iOS 14/iPadOS 14, and it has been expanded with new topics and additional tips.\n\nLet Scholle walk you through how to get the best out of Calendar and Reminders, including how to:\n\nCustomize Calendar to your liking, from setting time zones, to color coding specific calendars\nCreate events, making them repeat at regular intervals or on certain dates\nSet up notifications and alerts, so you never miss an event\nInvite people to events, or share your calendar with them\nCreate, manage, and share lists in Reminders\nSet alarms in Reminders at a certain time or a certain place\nUse Siri to save time when creating events or reminders\nUse Shortcuts to automate common tasks with Calendar and Reminders\nEasily check events and reminders on your Mac, iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, or HomePod\nTroubleshoot common problems in Calendar and Reminders\nShare calendars and reminders using iCloud Family Sharing, and assign reminders to a specific person\nSort reminders on your Mac\nPrint a calendar (to paper or PDF)","tags":["Business","Business / Personal Technology"]},{"id":"9780132995818","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"My Samsung Galaxy™ Nexus™","authors":["Craig James Johnston"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"July 2012","description":"Full-color, step-by-step tasks walk you through getting and keeping your Samsung Galaxy Nexus or other smartphone running Android 4 (Ice Cream Sandwich) working just the way you want.Step-by-step instructions with callouts to Samsung Galaxy Nexus photos that show you exactly what to do Help when you run into problems or limitations with your Samsung Galaxy Nexus Tips and Notes to help you get the most from your Samsung Galaxy Nexus Learn how to • Quickly set up Google services, voicemail, Gmail, Wi-Fi, and high-speed data connections • Use hidden time-saving shortcuts you won’t find anywhere else • Import, create, sync, organize, and manage all your contacts • Easily manage email, appointments, events, and reminders from all your accounts and services • Find web content fast with the powerful Galaxy Nexus web browser • Use Google Phone to save money, manage voicemail, and even automatically transcribe your messages • Instantly connect with friends on Facebook, Google+, and other social media services • Access and listen to all your music, wherever you go • Shoot and share stunningly sharp photos and HD video • Make the most of your Galaxy Nexus (or Android 4 smartphone) at work • Discover, download, and install today’s hottest new Android apps--including many great free apps • Keep your Galaxy Nexus (or Android 4 smartphone) up-to-date, reliable, and secure • Avoid expensive, unnecessary roaming charges","tags":["Business","Business / Personal Technology","Personal Devices","Mobile Devices / Computers","Samsung Galaxy"]},{"id":"0789730081","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Show Me Microsoft Office Outlook 2003","authors":["Steve Johnson - Perspection, Inc."],"pages":"368","publication_date":"September 2003","description":"See it done, do it yourself!

After all, it has been around for more than 20 years-practically an eternity in computer time. But Word has also provided its users-nearly everyone on the face of the planet-with an endless supply of annoyances. That is, until now. Word Annoyances offers to the point (and often opinionated) solutions to your most vexing editing, formatting, printing, faxing, and scanning problems. It covers everything from installation and templates to tables, columns, and graphics. For example, learn how to stop Word from searching the Web for help, and how to enter the same text easily in multiple parts of a document-and keep it updated automatically. It also provides a gentle introduction to the power of macros so you can slay your annoyances by the truckload. The fixes will work with most versions of Word, including Word 2000, Word 2002 (also known as Word XP), and Word 2003.Among the topics covered:\n\nDeal with installation issues, crashes, and slowdowns, and dispose of the Office Assistant-either temporarily or forever.\nMaster templates, numbering, graphics, hyperlinks, tabs, tables, headers, and other everyday annoyances.\nTame some of Word's wiliest features, such as Smart Cut and Paste, Click and Type, Mail Merge, AutoCorrect, and AutoText.\nPrinting, Faxing, and Scanning-need we say more?\nLearn to output and distribute your documents with confidence.\nNeed to work with other Microsoft applications or Macs?

Lennick and Kiel extensively identify the moral components at the heart of the recent financial crisis, and illuminate the monetary and human costs of failed moral leadership in global finance, business and government. The authors begin by systematically defining the principles of moral intelligence and the behavioral competencies associated with them. Next, they demonstrate why sustainable optimal performance–on both an individual and organizational level–requires the development and application of superior moral and emotional competencies. Using many new examples and real case studies and new interviews with key business leaders, they identify connections between moral intelligence and higher levels of trust, engagement, retention, and innovation. Readers will find specific guidance on moral leadership in both large organizations and entrepreneurial ventures, as well as a new, practical, step-by-step plan for measuring and strengthening every component of moral intelligence–from integrity and responsibility to compassion and forgiveness.

It becomes reasonable to ask why these efforts have not been working. Business faculty in ethics courses spend a lot of time teaching theories of ethical reasoning and analyzing those big, thorny dilemmas—triggering what one professor called “ethics fatigue.” But what if faculty stopped focusing on ethical analysis and focused on a new curriculum—one that builds a conversation across the core curriculum (not only in ethics courses) and also provides the teaching aids for a new way of thinking about ethics education? This is where Giving Voice to Values (GVV) comes in—the GVV curriculum asks the question: “What if I were going to act on my values? What would I say and do? How could I be most effective?” This book will help faculty across the business curriculum with examples, strategies, and assistance in applying the GVV approach. In addition to an introductory chapter, which explains the rationale and strategy behind GVV, there are twelve individual chapters by faculty from the major business functional areas and from faculty representing different geographic regions. The book is a useful guide for faculty from any business discipline on HOW to use the GVV approach in his or her teaching.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Business Ethics"]},{"id":"9781491999493","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"iPhone: The Missing Manual, 11th Edition","authors":["David Pogue"],"pages":"675","publication_date":"December 2017","description":"iOS 11 for the iPhone includes a host of exciting new features, including a revamped Control Center and all-new powers for some of your favorite apps—Siri, AirPlay 2, Maps, Photos, and Maps.

Fortunately, Glenn Fleishman, a veteran technology journalist and the author of Macworld's \"Mac 911\" column, is ready to help with expert advice on how to manage your Apple ID—including how to prevent, solve, or work around most common problems!\n\nIn this book, Glenn answers questions like:\n\nWhat all is my Apple ID used for?\nHow does my iCloud account relate to my Apple ID?\nWhat problems can two-factor authentication (2FA) solve, and how do I use it?\nAre there other mechanisms I can use to ensure that I can recover an Apple ID in the event of a problem? (Spoiler: yes!)\nWhat if I have a device that's too old to work with two-factor authentication?\nWhat should I do if I have two or more Apple IDs or iCloud accounts?\nWill I lose access to all my Apple media purchases if I move to another country?\nCan I share an Apple ID with someone else?\nWhat exactly should I do if I think someone is hacking my Apple ID account?\nHow can I recover a forgotten Apple ID password?\nWhat steps should I take if Apple locks me out of my account?\nIf I lose access to an email address associated with my Apple ID, what can I do?\nWhat Apple ID changes in iOS 14/iPadOS 14 and macOS 11 Big Sur do I need to know about?\nHow does \"Sign in with Apple\" work?\nHow can I use Family Sharing to share data and purchases within my family?\nWhat types of subscriptions can I manage with my Apple ID, and how?\nWhich payment methods can I associate with my Apple ID, and how do I manage them?\n\nAnd that's just the beginning. Glenn has packed a remarkable amount of concise problem-solving information into this compact, 124-page book. Read it before you encounter Apple ID problems to minimize your risk, and if you've already encountered a problem, read it to find the best path to a rapid solution.","tags":["Business","Business / Personal Technology","iCloud"]},{"id":"9781119579397","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Samsung Galaxy S10 For Dummies","authors":["Bill Hughes"],"pages":"320","publication_date":"May 2019","description":"The bestselling guide to your new Samsung \n\nThis book documents all the features and capabilities of Samsung Galaxy S10 device, approaching them from the point of view of a user who is intimidated by the technology and baffled by the documentation and online support that comes with the phones.

But the differences in Zoom from one platform to the next, the long list of complex features, and a constant stream of updates make it challenging to master. Take Control of Zoom, Second Edition provides a comprehensive look at Zoom from start to finish. Beginners will learn everything they need to get started, while more advanced users will sharpen their skills and discover new tricks. Everyone will benefit from extensive details on privacy and security.\n\nMany of us rarely touched a video chat or videoconferencing tool until the pandemic hit. Now, we videoconference daily (or more often) for all sorts of reasons—we’ve gone from zero to Zoom!\n\nDespite Zoom’s broad adoption, users sometimes struggle to keep up with its features and interface. Zoom changes constantly, and often spreads useful features across several places. This new edition of the book covers all the latest changes and the differences among platforms. You'll learn which Zoom app to use, how to configure your account and app even before your first meeting, how to work in Zoom views and chat in a meeting, and how to create and manage your own meetings. The book also covers how to share your screen, make presentations with PowerPoint or Keynote, annotate shared images, record audio and video, use full-screen mode and multiple displays, and work with machine-learning transcription and captioning.\n\nYou also learn about virtual cameras—software like Camo, mmHmm, OBS, and Zoom's built-in Slides as Virtual Background feature—that can take one or more media sources—still images, video, animation, app windows, and sometimes more—and mix into a camera feed you can simply select and broadcast as a host or participant in Zoom.\n\nThis book provides comprehensive advice and directions on planning a meeting, starting it up, and managing it, including running polls and setting up and using breakout rooms. It also provides extensive insight into keeping meetings safe, and warning or removing problematic participants.\n\nBut what about privacy and security? Since early 2020, Zoom has fixed bugs, promised improvements and delivered them, and come clean about where it fell short. The book covers the current state of Zoom security and privacy, including the introduction in the second half of 2020 of an end-to-end encryption (E2EE) preview available to all hosts. You can find out how E2EE works, Zoom’s implementation of it, how to enable it, and how to make sure your E2EE session remains free of snoopers.\n\nTopics include:\n\nHow to install and configure Zoom\nChoosing whether or when to use the Zoom web app\nConfiguring your physical setup and hardware for best audio and video quality\nMastering meeting participation, including the various methods of “speaking up”\nZoom’s many mobile and desktop views for seeing other people and shared screens\nThe best ways to present using PowerPoint and Keynote\nFinding the best combination of screens and devices to manage each of your presentations\nBecoming a host and starting meetings with one other person or 1,000\nConducting polls and managing breakout rooms\nUsing automatic transcription and captioning features\nHow to preserve your privacy when sharing apps, presentations, or other parts of your screen\nRecording a meeting for later playback, presentation, or a podcast\nDeciding whether to upgrade to a paid Zoom tier for meetings you host\nZoom’s security options, including end-to-end encryption\nHow co-host and alternate host roles work in managing a meeting","tags":["Business","Business / Personal Technology"]},{"id":"9781430266853","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Using Office 365: With Windows 8","authors":["Kevin Wilson"],"pages":"136","publication_date":"December 2013","description":"Learn Office the easy way, no jargon.

It is an individual choice, or rather a series of choices that emerges from the complex interaction of personal values with social imperatives. This book explores how and why some people become ethical leaders in morally challenging and complex social environments.\n\nIn Ethical Leadership, Aidan McQuade provides insight into the concept of human agency – the individual’s choice of a course of action in response to the options posed by that individual’s engagement with the social world. He puts forth a new model of human agency – the \"cruciform of agency\" – which recognises that the potential range of individual action emerges from the nature of the resonance that social options strike with personal thoughts. Every action adds to the individual’s personal biography in ways that influence subsequent choices by confirming or changing personal values and hopes, hence influencing the way the individual subsequently thinks about the world.\n\nIn explaining the potential and limits of human agency for ethical leadership, the book establishes a basis for executives, policy makers and academics to conceptualise and develop more robust and realistic approaches for the mitigation of some of the most pressing moral issues facing humanity today. These include the inter-related challenges of modern slavery and global warming, which pose such critical threats to the Earth itself.\n\nIn this book McQuade not only sets an agenda for action but empowers individual leaders to find the moral courage to better advance human rights and preserve the environment even when such action requires unpopular choices.\n\nEvents around the book\n\nLink to a De Gruyter Online Event in which the author and independent human rights consultant Aidan McQuade together with Bernd Vogel, Director of the Henley Centre for Leadership at Henley Business School, Joanne Murphy, Director of Research & Co-Director of the Centre for Leadership, Ethics & Organisation at Queen’s Management School; Ambassador Luis C. deBaca, Professor from Practice, University of Michigan Law School discuss topics such as: what potentially deters leaders from making ethical decisions; what can they draw upon both internally and externally to do the right thing when doing so may be unpopular; how, in the light of fake news, can leaders communicate ethically; and much more:https://youtu.be/EYAAGiCX4cI","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Business Ethics"]},{"id":"9781430233060","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Windows Phone 7 Game Development","authors":["Adam Dawes"],"pages":"586","publication_date":"December 2010","description":"Windows Phone 7 is a powerful mobile computing platform with huge potential for gaming.

You'll also find help with editing logins--for example, changing a password or adding further details.\n\nUnderstand password security: Get guidance on what makes for a good password, and read Joe's important Password Dos and Don'ts. A special topic covers how to perform a security audit in order to improve poor passwords quickly.\n\nGo beyond web logins: A primary point of 1Password is to speed up web logins, but 1Password can also store and autofill contact information (for more than one identity, even), along with credit card information. You'll also find advice on storing passwords for password-protected files and encrypted disk images, plus ideas for keeping track of confidential files, software licenses, scans of important cards or documents, and more.\n\nSync your passwords: Discover which 1Password syncing solution is right for you: a hosted 1Password account, Dropbox, iCloud, a manually synced folder, or even device-to-device Wi-Fi sync.\n\nShare your passwords: Learn to store passwords in shared vaults within a family or team hosted account.\n\nYou'll also discover the answers to key questions, including:\n\nWhat are my options for licensing 1Password?\nWhat are the differences between vaults in 1Password accounts and standalone vaults?\nShould I keep using my web browser's autofill feature?\nWhat about iCloud Keychain? Should I use that too?\nWhat can I do quickly to get better password security?\nHow can I find and update weak passwords I created long ago?\nWhat should I do about security questions, like the name of my pet?\nHow can 1Password provide a time-based one-time password (TOTP)?\nHow do I use 1Password logins from utilities like LaunchBar?","tags":["Business","Business / Personal Technology","Personal Software"]},{"id":"9780133047769","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"My iPad® (covers iOS 5.1 on iPad, iPad 2, and iPad 3rd gen), Fourth Edition","authors":["Gary Rosenzweig"],"pages":"460","publication_date":"April 2012","description":"My iPad, 4/e, is the perfect guide to help you get the most out of your iPad.

To accomplish this attainable goal, we must realize that business is composed of individuals who must make the conscious choice to pursue a more ideal future.\n\nIn this revolutionary approach to business ethics, Wade Chumney utilizes his nearly 20 years of experience in the field to synthesizes the ancient wisdom found in Plato’s philosophy, the modern findings of positive psychology, and the powerful insights of systems thinking to create a new paradigm for the field. Centered around the consciousness found within each of us, Conscious Business Ethics provides a practical approach that anyone can apply in order to develop the one quality most desired by humanity in any historical era: wisdom.\n\nThis book can transform your life for the better.

Ignoring all precedents and defying even his own party, he has opened an era where neither tradition nor precedent remains the order of the day. Fake news has become the entertainment watchword in an era where a president can send out his own daily tweets to millions of followers and the world press, and no one is able to pre-empt his message or know how to respond. In what would be described negotiation madness, Trump incites confrontation into intransient situations: opening an American embassy in Jerusalem and provoking a North Korean leader by a silly name, which nevertheless still initiates first-time discussions between north and south. If he doesn’t get his wish through Congress, he pretends to give up, plays the man not the issue, going against what all the negotiation books tell you, then comes in again to get what he wants. At every turn the standards of negotiation need to be rewritten in what has become as much politics as entertainment, ego rather than substance, and this is what is targeted in Peter Nelson’s Negotiation Madness.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Business Negotiation"]},{"id":"0672327880","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Novell® GroupWise® 7 Administrator Solutions Guide","authors":["Tay Kratzer","Erno de Korte"],"pages":"936","publication_date":"October 2005","description":"Novell GroupWise 7 Administrator Solutions Guide is the authoritative guide for successfully administrating and maintaining the newest release of Novell's communication and collaboration solution.

Overcome password frustration with expert advice from Joe Kissell!\n\nPasswords have become a truly maddening aspect of modern life, but with this book, you can discover how the experts handle all manner of password situations, including multi-factor authentication that can protect you even if your password is hacked or stolen.\n\nThe book explains what makes a password secure and helps you create a strategy that includes using a password manager, working with oddball security questions like \"What is your pet’s favorite movie?\", and making sure your passwords are always available when needed.\n\nJoe helps you choose a password manager (or switch to a better one) in a chapter that discusses desirable features and describes nine different apps, with a focus on those that work in macOS, iOS, Windows, and Android. The book also looks at how you can audit your passwords to keep them in tip-top shape, use two-step verification and two-factor authentication, and deal with situations where a password manager can’t help.\n\nNew in the Fourth Edition is complete coverage of passkeys, which offer a way to log in without passwords and are rapidly gaining popularity—but also come with a new set of challenges and complications.

Version 2.0, updated September 10, 2025\n\nThe center of the Apple world is your Apple Account. This identifier ties up your access to iCloud; to purchased and streaming music, TV, and movies; and to all your devices. While an Apple Account is essential, Apple has made it difficult to navigate the many features associated with it—and particularly to troubleshoot and resolve problems that crop up. This book answers dozens of questions and guides you through solutions. It also explains how to use security, recovery, and other features tied to your Apple Account.\n\nNote: This book updates and replaces Glenn’s earlier title Take Control of Your Apple ID. Because Apple renamed “Apple ID” to “Apple Account,” we had to change the title of the book as well.\n\nEverything Apple relies on your Apple Account. It’s a key that unlocks a long list of Apple products and services on any of numerous devices. iCloud uses an Apple Account, as does Apple Music; the App Store; the Music, TV, and Books apps; and more. An Apple Account protects your personal information, including email and iPhone/iPad backups; helps you find a lost iPhone, iPad, Mac, or Apple Watch; and can even unlock your Mac. So it goes without saying that if something goes wrong with your Apple Account, you could be in for a world of hurt.\n\nUnfortunately, things go wrong with Apple Accounts all the time. Fortunately, Glenn Fleishman, a veteran technology journalist and the author of Macworld’s “Mac 911” column, is ready to help with expert advice on how to manage your Apple Account—including how to prevent, solve, or work around most common problems!\n\nThis book is fully up to date with iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS 26 Tahoe, watchOS 26, tvOS 26, and other Apple products and services.\n\nIn this book, Glenn answers questions like:\n\nWhat all is my Apple Account used for?\nHow does my iCloud account relate to my Apple Account?\nWhat’s two-factor authentication and how do I manage it—and not get locked out of my account?\nShould I invest in hardware security keys to up the protection of my Apple Account?\nAre there other mechanisms I can use to ensure that I can recover an Apple Account in the event of a problem? (Spoiler: yes!)\nWhat should I do if I have two or more Apple Accounts or iCloud accounts?\nWill I lose access to all my Apple media purchases if I move to another country?\nCan I share an Apple Account with someone else?\nWhat does an Apple One subscription offer and how does it interact with Family Sharing and iCloud+ storage tiers?\nIs there an explanation for how code-based and hardware-based second factors protect my account and how they differ from passkeys? (Yes!)\nWhat exactly should I do if I think someone is hacking my Apple Account?\nHow can I recover a forgotten Apple Account password?\nWhat happens if I’m assaulted or drugged and someone gains access to my iPhone passcode and resets my Apple Account? (Sadly, a too real, if uncommon, problem.)\nWhat steps should I take if Apple locks me out of my account?\nIf I lose access to an email address associated with my Apple Account, what can I do?\nWhat Apple Account changes in recent versions of iOS, iPadOS, and macOS do I need to know about?\nHow can I use Family Sharing to share data and purchases within my family?\nWhat types of subscriptions can I manage with my Apple Account, and how?\nWhich payment methods can I associate with my Apple Account, and how do I manage them?\n\nAnd that’s just the beginning. Glenn has packed a remarkable amount of concise problem-solving information into this comprehensive book. Read it before you encounter Apple Account problems to minimize your risk, and if you’ve already encountered a problem, read it to find the best path to a rapid solution.","tags":["Business","Business / Personal Technology","iCloud"]},{"id":"9781398620971","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Negotiation for Procurement and Supply Chain Professionals, 4th Edition","authors":["Jonathan O'Brien"],"pages":"504","publication_date":"August 2025","description":"A step-by-step approach to delivering winning negotiations with tools and tactics for purchasing and supply chain professionals.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Business Negotiation"]},{"id":"9780128015391","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Modern Enterprise Business Intelligence and Data Management","authors":["Alan Simon"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"August 2014","description":"Nearly every large corporation and governmental agency is taking a fresh look at their current enterprise-scale business intelligence (BI) and data warehousing implementations at the dawn of the \"Big Data Era\"…and most see a critical need to revitalize their current capabilities.

Through hard to find real world examples you will learn exactly how to effectively and productively negotiate. The Book of Real World Negotiations: Successful Strategies from Business, Government and Daily Life shines a light on real world negotiation examples and cases, rather than discussing hypothetical scenarios. It reveals what is possible through preparation, persistence, creativity, and taking a strategic approach to your negotiations. Many of us enter negotiations with skepticism and without understanding how to truly negotiate well. Because we lack knowledge and confidence, we may abandon the negotiating process prematurely or agree to deals that leave value on the table.  \n\nThe Book of Real World Negotiations will change that once and for all by immersing you in these real world scenarios. As a result, you’ll be better able to grasp the true power of negotiation to deal with some of the most difficult problems you face or to put together the best deals possible. This book also shares critical insights and lessons for instructors and students of negotiation, especially since negotiation is now being taught in virtually all law schools, many business schools, and in the field of conflict resolution. Whether you’re a student, instructor, or anyone who wants to negotiate successfully, you’ll be able to carefully examine real world negotiation situations that will show you how to achieve your objectives in the most challenging of circumstances. The cases are organized by realms—domestic business cases, international business cases, governmental cases and cases that occur in daily life. From these cases you will learn more about:\n\nExactly how to achieve Win-Win outcomes\nThe critical role of underlying interests\nThe kind of thinking that goes into generating creative options\nHow to consider your and the other negotiator’s Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement (BATNA)\nNegotiating successfully in the face of power\nAchieving success when negotiating cross-culturally\n\nOnce you come to understand through these cases that negotiation is the art of the possible, you’ll stop saying \"a solution is impossible.\" With the knowledge and self-assurance you gain from this book, you’ll roll up your sleeves and keep negotiating until you reach a mutually satisfactory outcome!","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Business Negotiation"]},{"id":"9781484208502","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Advanced Negotiation Techniques","authors":["Steve Hay","Alan McCarthy"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"February 2015","description":"Advanced Negotiation Techniques provides a wealth of material in a winning combination of practical experience and good research to give you a series of tools, techniques, and real-life examples to help you achieve your negotiation objectives.\n\nFor 25 years and across 40 countries, the Resource Development Centre (RDC), run by negotiation experts Alan McCarthy and Steve Hay, has helped thousands of people to conduct successful negotiations of every type. Many RDC clients have been business professionals who have learned how to sell more successfully. Others have improved their buying skills. A few clients have applied the RDC techniques outside the business environment altogether—for instance, in such areas as international diplomatic services, including hostage and kidnap situations.\n\nAs you’ll discover, the RDC philosophy is centered on business ethics and a principled approach to negotiation that maximizes the value of the outcomes for both parties. It can even create additional value that neither party could find in isolation. In this book, you will learn:\n\nThe ten golden rules for successful negotiations\nHow to handle conflicts with your negotiating partners\nWhat hostage and kidnapping negotiations can teach managers negotiating in business settings\nHow to ensure both sides perceive any agreement as a \"\"win\"\"\nAchieve higher-profit deals in difficult circumstances\n\nIn the business world, negotiating with other companies, government officials, and even your colleagues is a fact of life.

Version 4.0, published September 21, 2023\n\nThe center of the Apple world is the Apple ID. This little identifier ties up your access to iCloud, to purchased and streaming music, TV, and movies, and to all your devices. While an Apple ID account is critical, Apple has made it difficult to navigate the many features associated with it—and particularly to troubleshoot when things go wrong. This book helps you manage your password, enhanced security, and account details, and recovery options, like the Recovery Key and Recovery Contact. You will find it invaluable as a guide for every-day Apple ID questions, and in a pinch when you’re at wit’s end.\n\nEverything Apple relies on your Apple ID. It’s a key that unlocks a long list of Apple products and services on any of numerous devices. iCloud uses an Apple ID, as does Apple Music; the App Store; the Music, TV, and Books apps; and more. An Apple ID protects your personal information, including email and iOS/iPadOS backups; helps you find a lost iPhone; and can even unlock your Mac. So it goes without saying that if something goes wrong with your Apple ID, you could be in for a world of hurt.\n\nUnfortunately, things go wrong with Apple IDs all the time. Fortunately, Glenn Fleishman, a veteran technology journalist and the author of Macworld’s “Mac 911” column, is ready to help with expert advice on how to manage your Apple ID—including how to prevent, solve, or work around most common problems!\n\nThis latest edition is fully updated for all the changes released by Apple in 2023 connected to your Apple ID, as well as for iOS 17, iPadOS 17, macOS 14 Sonoma, watchOS 10, tvOS 17, and other Apple products and services.\n\nIn this book, Glenn answers questions like:\n\nWhat all is my Apple ID used for?\nHow does my iCloud account relate to my Apple ID?\nWhat’s two-factor authentication and how do I manage it—and not get locked out of my account?\nShould I invest in hardware security keys to up the protection of my Apple ID account?\nWhat problems can two-factor authentication (2FA) solve, and how do I use it?\nAre there other mechanisms I can use to ensure that I can recover an Apple ID in the event of a problem? (Spoiler: yes!)\nWhat should I do if I have two or more Apple IDs or iCloud accounts?\nWill I lose access to all my Apple media purchases if I move to another country?\nCan I share an Apple ID with someone else?\nWhat does an Apple One account offer and how does it interact with Family Sharing and iCloud+ storage tiers?\nIs there an explanation for how code-based and hardware-based second factors protect my account and how they differ from passkeys? (Yes!)\nWhat exactly should I do if I think someone is hacking my Apple ID account?\nHow can I recover a forgotten Apple ID password?\nWhat happens if I’m assaulted or drugged and someone gains access to my iPhone passcode and resets my Apple ID? (Sadly, a too real, if uncommon, problem.)\nWhat steps should I take if Apple locks me out of my account?\nIf I lose access to an email address associated with my Apple ID, what can I do?\nWhat Apple ID changes in recent versions of iOS, iPadOS, and macOS do I need to know about?\nHow can I use Family Sharing to share data and purchases within my family?\nWhat types of subscriptions can I manage with my Apple ID, and how?\nWhich payment methods can I associate with my Apple ID, and how do I manage them?\n\nAnd that’s just the beginning.

Kolb","Jessica L. Porter"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"January 2015","description":"Understand the context of negotiations to achieve better results\n\nNegotiation has always been at the heart of solving problems at work. Yet today, when people in organizations are asked to do more with less, be responsive 24/7, and manage in rapidly changing environments, negotiation is more essential than ever. What has been missed in much of the literature of the past 30 years is that negotiations in organizations always take place within a context—of organizational culture, of prior negotiations, of power relationships—that dictates which issues are negotiable and by whom. When we negotiate for new opportunities or increased flexibility, we never do it in a vacuum. We challenge the status quo and we build out the path for others to negotiate those issues after us. In this way, negotiating for ourselves at work can create small wins that can grow into something bigger, for ourselves and our organizations. Seen in this way, negotiation becomes a tool for addressing ineffective practices and outdated assumptions, and for creating change.\n\nNegotiating at Work offers practical advice for managing your own workplace negotiations: how to get opportunities, promotions, flexibility, buy-in, support, and credit for your work. It does so within the context of organizational dynamics, recognizing that to negotiate with someone who has more power adds a level of complexity. The is true when we negotiate with our superiors, and also true for individuals currently under represented in senior leadership roles, whose managers may not recognize certain issues as barriers or obstacles. \n\n Negotiating at Work is rooted in real-life cases of professionals from a wide range of industries and organizations, both national and international.\n\nStrategies to get the other person to the table and engage in creative problem solving, even when they are reluctant to do so\nTips on how to recognize opportunities to negotiate, bolster your confidence prior to the negotiation, turn 'asks' into a negotiation, and advance negotiations that get \"stuck\"\nA rich examination of research on negotiation, conflict management, and gender\n\nBy using these strategies, you can negotiate successfully for your job and your career; in a larger field, you can also alter organizational practices and policies that impact others.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Business Negotiation"]},{"id":"9781484280768","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Introducing Charticulator for Power BI: Design Vibrant and Customized Visual Representations of Data","authors":["Alison Box"],"pages":"407","publication_date":"March 2022","description":"Create stunning and complex visualizations using the amazing Charticulator custom visuals in Power BI. \n\nCharticulator offers users immense power to generate visuals and graphics.

As international trade and foreign direct investment (FDI) continue to increase, TNCs based in industrialized 'home' nations are gaining enormous economic and political influence in developing 'host' nations.

With a cosmopolitan human rights perspective on international business ethics, this comprehensive volume describes modern transnational companies, explains why companies and their leaders are responsible for company policies and practices, and presents a conceptual framework grounded in respect for basic human rights. Arnold addresses a wide range of central topics, such as the role of transnational companies in global justice, the human rights obligations of transnational companies, labor rights in global supply chains, corporate responsibility regarding global climate change, and exploitation and empowerment at the base of the global economic pyramid.\n\nPresents and defends a theory of moral legitimacy that views TNCs as agents of justice\nOffers an alternative ethical conception of CSR that integrates a cosmopolitan human rights perspective\nProvides critical and ethical analysis of recent United Nations (UN) initiatives on business and human rights including the UN tripartite framework recently approved by the UN Human Rights Council\nAnalyzes current Base of the Pyramid (BoP) strategies\nDefends minimum standards for working conditions in global supply chains and analyzes wage exploitation in developing nations\nDemonstrates the need for ethical CSR and morally legitimate BoP business ventures that do not exploit people living in moderate and extreme poverty (MEP)\n\nThe Ethics of Global Business is essential reading for business leaders, policymakers, scholars, undergraduate and graduate students, and general readers with an interest in business ethics, global justice, human rights, sweatshop ethics, solutions to global poverty, corporate environmental sustainability, and global climate change as related to transnational companies.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Business Ethics"]},{"id":"9780814409930","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Persuasion IQ: The 10 Skills You Need to Get Exactly What You Want","authors":["Kurt W.

What Control Center is and how to customize it? How to use a share sheet? What to do when you get too many annoying notifications? How to find apps in a sea of icons? Ways to run multiple apps at the same time on an iPad? Those are just a few of the topics Josh explains in detail.

With coverage of 1Password version 8 for Mac, Windows, Linux, iOS/iPadOS, Android, and Apple Watch, author Joe Kissell shows you how to generate and enter secure passwords, speed up your online shopping, and share and sync web logins and other confidential data.\n\nWrangling your web passwords can be easy and secure, thanks to 1Password, the popular password manager from AgileBits. In this book, Joe Kissell brings years of real-world 1Password experience into play to explain not only how to create, edit, and enter web login data easily, but also how to autofill contact and credit card info when shopping online, audit your passwords and generate better ones, handle two-factor authentication (2FA), sync data across devices using a hosted 1Password account (individual, family, or business), and securely share passwords with family members, coworkers, and friends.\n\nThis fully revised sixth edition covers 1Password version 8 for Mac, Windows, Linux, iOS/iPadOS, Android, and Apple Watch. It does not include instructions for using earlier versions of 1Password.\n\nTopics include:\n\nMeet 1Password: Set your master password, explore the various 1Password components, and decide on your ideal usage strategy.\n\nWhat's New in Version 8: 1Password 8 unifies features and interface across platforms and adds important new features—but it also includes some controversial changes. Learn what has changed, how to migrate from older versions, and what new behaviors you must adjust to.\n\nMaster logins: In 1Password, a typical login contains a set of credentials used to sign in to a website. Find out how to create logins, sort them, search them, tag them, and more. You’ll also find help with editing logins—for example, changing a password or adding further details.\n\nUnderstand password security: Get guidance on what makes for a good password, and read Joe’s important Password Dos and Don’ts. A special topic covers how to perform a security audit in order to improve poor passwords quickly.\n\nGo beyond web logins: A primary point of 1Password is to speed up web logins, but 1Password can also store and autofill contact information (for more than one identity, even), along with credit card information. You’ll also find advice on storing SSH keys, passwords for password-protected files and encrypted disk images, confidential files, software licenses, scans of important cards or documents, and more.\n\nSync your passwords: Discover how a hosted 1Password account can sync all your data securely across your devices.\n\nShare your passwords: Learn to store passwords within a family or team hosted account, or even with people who don't already use 1Password at all.\n\nYou’ll also discover the answers to key questions, including:\n\nShould I keep using my web browser’s autofill feature?\nWhat about iCloud Keychain? Should I use that too?\nDo I need the full 1Password app, or is the browser extension enough?\nHow does the Universal Autofill feature for Mac work across browsers and apps?\nWhat are passkeys, and what can 1Password do with them?\nHow can 1Password help me with sites where I sign in with my Apple, Google, or Facebook account?\nWhat's the easy way to prevent sensitive information from falling into the wrong hands at a border crossing?\nWhat can I do quickly to get better password security?\nHow can I find and update weak passwords I created long ago?\nWhat should I do about security questions, like the name of my pet?\nHow can 1Password provide a time-based one-time password (TOTP)?","tags":["Business","Business / Personal Technology","Personal Software"]},{"id":"9781119736080","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"AI-Enabled Analytics for Business","authors":["Lawrence S.

Yet most people do anything they can to avoid negotiating—it makes them uncomfortable, nervous, even frightened. This plague of negotiaphobia is what Don Hutson and George Lucas are here to remedy.Hutson and Lucas tell the tale of Jay Baxter, who sells more than anyone else in his company but finds himself in trouble because his profit margins are so slim—he's giving too much away to close the deal. Enter the One Minute Negotiator, who teaches him a three-step negotiating process that not only helps him make more profit per sale but can be applied anywhere, on the job or off.The key to the process is flexibility. Most books on negotiation preach one of two gospels: thou shalt collaborate or thou shalt compete. But no two negotiations are alike—one strategy cannot fit all. The One Minute Negotiator teaches you four viable strategies and shows how to choose the one best suited to the situation, your own inclinations, and the strategy being used by the other side. Besides the obvious benefits, conquering negotiaphobia will reduce your stress level. You'll never walk away thinking about what you should have asked for or might have gotten. Instead, with the tools Hutson and Lucas provide, you can confidently and consistently guide any negotiation to the best possible conclusion.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Business Negotiation"]},{"id":"9781947282346","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Take Control of Slack","authors":["Glenn Fleishman"],"pages":"196","publication_date":"October 2020","description":"Master Slack for work and fun!Version 1.2.2, updated 10/8/2020\n\nWrap your head around how Slack group messaging works, learn to communicate and collaborate using its many features, and discover how to use integrations and notifications to get more out of it.

Microsoft’s BI toolset has undergone significant changes in the SQL Server 2005 development cycle. SQL Server 2005 is the first viable, full-functioned data warehouse and business intelligence platform to be offered at a price that will make data warehousing and business intelligence available to a broad set of organizations. This book is meant to offer practical techniques to guide those organizations through the myriad of challenges to true success as measured by contribution to business value.\n\nBuilding a data warehousing and business intelligence system is a complex business and engineering effort. While there are significant technical challenges to overcome in successfully deploying a data warehouse, the authors find that the most common reason for data warehouse project failure is insufficient focus on the business users and business problems. In an effort to help people gain success, this book takes the proven Business Dimensional Lifecycle approach first described in best selling The Data Warehouse Lifecycle Toolkit and applies it to the Microsoft SQL Server 2005 tool set.\n\nBeginning with a thorough description of how to gather business requirements, the book then works through the details of creating the target dimensional model, setting up the data warehouse infrastructure, creating the relational atomic database, creating the analysis services databases, designing and building the standard report set, implementing security, dealing with metadata, managing ongoing maintenance and growing the DW/BI system. All of these steps tie back to the business requirements. Each chapter describes the practical steps in the context of the SQL Server 2005 platform.\n\nIntended Audience\n\nThe target audience for this book is the IT department or service provider (consultant) who is:\n\nPlanning a small to mid-range data warehouse project;\n\nEvaluating or planning to use Microsoft technologies as the primary or exclusive data warehouse server technology;\n\nFamiliar with the general concepts of data warehousing and business intelligence.\n\nThe book will be directed primarily at the project leader and the warehouse developers, although everyone involved with a data warehouse project will find the book useful. Some of the book’s content will be more technical than the typical project leader will need; other chapters and sections will focus on business issues that are interesting to a database administrator or programmer as guiding information.\n\nThe book is focused on the mass market, where the volume of data in a single application or data mart is less than 500 GB of raw data. While the book does discuss issues around handling larger warehouses in the Microsoft environment, it is not exclusively, or even primarily, concerned with the unusual challenges of extremely large datasets.\n\nAbout the Authors\n\nJOY MUNDY has focused on data warehousing and business intelligence since the early 1990s, specializing in business requirements analysis, dimensional modeling, and business intelligence systems architecture. Joy co-founded InfoDynamics LLC, a data warehouse consulting firm, then joined Microsoft WebTV to develop closed-loop analytic applications and a packaged data warehouse.\n\nBefore returning to consulting with the Kimball Group in 2004, Joy worked in Microsoft SQL Server product development, managing a team that developed the best practices for building business intelligence systems on the Microsoft platform. Joy began her career as a business analyst in banking and finance. She graduated from Tufts University with a BA in Economics, and from Stanford with an MS in Engineering Economic Systems.\n\nWARREN THORNTHWAITE has been building data warehousing and business intelligence systems since 1980. Warren worked at Metaphor for eight years, where he managed the consulting organization and implemented many major data warehouse systems. After Metaphor, Warren managed the enterprise-wide data warehouse development at Stanford University. He then co-founded InfoDynamics LLC, a data warehouse consulting firm, with his co-author, Joy Mundy.

The justification for CSR is therefore associated with representing the nature and role of the company, as well as its purpose. Companies therefore regard CSR as a strategic investment that is part of a proactive, resilient, inclusive approach, based on the creation of shared value. This approach is capable of reducing negative societal impacts of their activities, or inducing positive impacts if they sustain a hybrid culture, all the while improving their competitive advantage. This book presents a theoretical development that analyzes the challenges of CSR strategies based on the creation of shared value. Two case studies are presented, analyzing the different forms of social innovation strategies capable of inducing this shared value creation.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Business Ethics"]},{"id":"9781292186948","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Futureproof","authors":["Minter Dial","Caleb Storkey"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"September 2017","description":"Futureproof paints a complete picture of the major disruptive forces currently facing us - defining them, mapping them out and putting them into context.

Consider what goes on during your typical week: Can you influence your client to accept your proposal? Will you persuade colleagues to give you the resources you need to finish your project? How will you ask your neighbor to switch carpool days so that you will finally have time to get to the gym?\n\nAccording to conventional wisdom, a \"win-win\" outcome is the hallmark of success. However, until now, advice on getting there has overlooked one crucial element. It turns out that the most important negotiations you have, the ones that drive the impact of your leadership and the quality of your life, are the ones you have with yourself.\n\nWhat does negotiating with yourself mean? It's what happens when you want to stay at the office, but also want to keep your promise to the family to get home in time for dinner. Or when one side of you votes to roll the dice and go for your dream job, while another worries about paying the mortgage. It's what you do when one part of you wants to give your relationship every chance to work, while another knows that this time it's really over.\n\nWhen you're of more than one mind about what to do, negotiating with yourself is an essential skill. Should you say yes or no, or should you stall for time? Offer an olive branch or lay down the law? Speak your mind or hold your peace? When you know how to win the tug-of-wars inside of you, then you can \"get to yes\" in lasting and transformational ways.\n\nWith honesty, humor, and fresh ideas, Winning from Within gives you a clear road map for knowing your inner world and a method for sorting yourself out.\n\nWhether you're struggling with a difficult customer or arguing with your spouse, by understanding what leadership and negotiation expert Erica Ariel Fox calls your \"inner negotiators,\" you'll learn to turn breakdowns into breakthroughs.

Rather that viewing every negotiation as an antagonistic and combative relationship, this book shows you how to move beyond the traditional pseudo win-win to construct a deal in which all parties get what they need. By exploring who we are as negotiators in the context of social conditioning, this model examines the cognitive, psychological, social, physical, and spiritual aspects of negotiation to help you produce more sustainable, prosperous, and satisfying agreements.\n\nWe often think of negotiation as taking place in a boardroom, a car dealership, or any other contract-centered situation; in reality, we are negotiating every time we ask for something we need or want. Building more robust negotiation behaviors that resonate beyond the boardroom requires a deep engagement with others and a clear mindset of interdependence. This book helps you shift your perspective and build these important skills through a journey of discovery, reflection, and action.\n\nRethink your assumptions about negotiations, your self-perception, your counterpart, and the overall relationship\nAdopt new tools that clarify what you want, why you need it, and how your counterpart can also get what they want and need\nChallenge fundamental world views related to negotiation, and shift from adversarial to engaging and satisfying\nUnderstand the unseen forces at work in any negotiation, and prevent them from derailing your success\n\nIn the interest of creating an environment that elevates everyone’s participation and assists them in reaching their full potential, Quantum Negotiation addresses the reality of hardball and coercion with a focus on engaging the human spirit to create new opportunities and resources.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Business Negotiation"]},{"id":"9781803230993","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Democratizing Application Development with Betty Blocks","authors":["Reinier van Altena"],"pages":"296","publication_date":"February 2023","description":"\"Democratizing Application Development with Betty Blocks\" is a hands-on guide for learning the Betty Blocks no-code platform to develop impactful, dynamic business applications.

Moves in their \"second dimension\"deal designsystematically unlock economic and noneconomic value by creatively structuring agreements. But what sets the 3-D approach apart is its \"third dimension\": setup. Before showing up at a bargaining session, 3-D Negotiators ensure that the right parties have been approached, in the right sequence, to address the right interests, under the right expectations, and facing the right consequences of walking away if there is no deal. This new arsenal of moves away from the table often has the greatest impact on the negotiated outcome.

Some examples of these widespread assumptions in the business and work environments are: employees being viewed as commodities, competitors perceived as threats, companies’ resources seen as limited, and customers perceived as scarce and difficult, etc. All which leads to the question, \"Is there a way to perform business activities more humanely?\"\n\nThis book challenges the reader to change the way they perform in business situations and become more focused on the human aspects of business activities. The users of this knowledge and those affected by them will undergo a profound transformation in the way they perform business activities. They will benefit from gradually testing and implementing the guidelines conveyed in this book, both in the business environment and the workplace. When readers put these principles into practice, positive ripple effects are bound to affect other stakeholders of the organization they work for or own.\n\nThis book includes aspects related to mission and vision, passion, business mindset, organizational learning, improvement of business conversations, use of constructive criticism and improvement of relationships with the most relevant stakeholders (customers, suppliers, intermediaries, community, and employees, etc.). The book also includes a discussion of creativity and the innovation process, as well as other factors that create a healthy business environment.

The authors begin by systematically defining the principles of moral intelligence and the behavioral competencies associated with them. Next, they demonstrate why sustainable optimal performance–on both an individual and organizational level–requires the development and application of superior moral and emotional competencies. Using many new examples and real case studies and new interviews with key business leaders, they identify connections between moral intelligence and higher levels of trust, engagement, retention, and innovation. Readers will find specific guidance on moral leadership in both large organizations and entrepreneurial ventures, as well as a new, practical, step-by-step plan for measuring and strengthening every component of moral intelligence–from integrity and responsibility to compassion and forgiveness.\n\nIn Jon Huntsman's Winners Never Cheat: Even In Difficult Times. Who's Jon Huntsman? Someone who started with practically nothing, and made it to Forbes' list of America's Top 100 richest people: a self-made multi-billionaire. This book presents the lessons of his lifetime in business: a life that has included the best of times and the worst. The first edition became an instant classic; now, Huntsman has thoroughly updated it with new chapters on maintaining your principles in difficult times, when dishonest \"sharks\" seem to be everywhere. This is no mere exhortation: it's as practical as a book can get. It's about how you listen to your moral compass, even as others ignore theirs. It's about building teams with higher values...sharing success and taking responsibility...earning the rewards that only come with giving back. Huntsman built his career and fortune on these principles. You don't live them just to \"win\": you live them because they're right. But in an age of cheating and scandal, Huntsman's life proves honesty is more than right: it's your biggest competitive differentiator. So, consider what kind of person you want to do business with. Then, be that person and use this book to get you there.

Now, we have powerful tools, like Apple's Calendar and Reminders, that are much more responsive to our needs. Put an event on your schedule, invite others to join, or set yourself an alarm (or more than one).

For example, did you know that in Calendar you can set an alert for when you need to leave for an event, based on the travel time calculated using the location you entered for the event? Or that Reminders can prompt you to do something not only at a certain time, but also once you've reached a specific destination, like the grocery store?\n\nIf you've never taken the opportunity to explore Calendar and Reminders, this book will show you how to make them an important part of your daily routine.

That begins with having the right strategy, the right leadership to drive it, and the right talent, culture, and organizational design to realize a company's potential. This is especially true in the AI era, where a company's most valuable assets are its people. To begin with, leaders must rethink their value creation strategies. To hone their organizational edge, leaders must prioritize their organization's health in seven vital areas: strategic direction, culture, leadership, talent, organizational design, EID (equity, inclusion, and diversity), and well-being. No matter what type or size of business, those essential conditions must be leveraged for increased value and growth. Put simply: organizational matters matter. To hone their digital edge, leaders must understand AI, as advances in technology allow leaders to build organizations that can compete and win in the future. Finally, an investor mindset will enable leaders to invest wisely in the technology (and leverage that tech) that sets their organizations apart.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Business Architecture"]},{"id":"1565926005","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"PalmPilot: The Ultimate Guide, Second Edition","authors":["David Pogue"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"May 2000","description":"3Com's PalmPilot is the world's bestselling hand-held computer platform. In three years, its 16 models from 5 different manufacturers have captured 80 percent of the palmtop market. About the size of a playing card, Palm devices are lightweight (under 6 ounces), offering two-month battery life, handwriting recognition, Internet connectivity, and a touch-screen display. Above all, these devices are fast and elegantly designed. PalmPilot: The Ultimate Guide was an instant classic when it debuted in 1998, becoming, and remaining, the bestselling Palm book (and a top ten title among all computer books) every month since. Dense with previously undocumented information, this newly updated bible for Palm users delivers hundreds of timesaving tips and surprising tricks, plus a CD-ROM containing over 3,100 Palm programs. The second edition offers exclusive insider coverage of all models, including 1999's Palm IIIx, Palm V, laser-equipped Symbol 1500, and the revolutionary, wireless Palm VII. The book is divided into five sections:\n\nSection One details every hardware and software aspect of PalmPilot as it comes out of the box: the stylus and screen, the buttons, and the current line of models. A tutorial takes the reader through the palmtop's preferences and settings panels, teaches the Graffiti alphabet, and unearths surprising features of the machine's eight built-in programs.\n\nSection Two explains step-by-step how your PalmPilot can work with your PC: how data gets from your palmtop to your desktop computer and back again (HotSyncing). New chapters give special coverage to the separate Windows and Macintosh (Mac Pac 2.0) versions of Palm Desktop, which duplicates the functions of the PalmPilot (calendar, phone book, to-do list, memo pad, email, and expense tracking) on the desktop machine.\n\nSection Three takes the reader beyond the built-in Palm software to the best of the add-on programs included with the book. They include such graphics programs as DinkyPad, TealPaint, and the amazing ImageViewer (which unlocks the \"black-and-white\" Pilot screen's grayscale features); electronic books in Doc format; and music programs that use the hand-held's built-in speaker. New in this edition: how-to advice for using PalmPilot database programs to collect data in the field, and syncing them with such popular PC programs as FileMaker and Microsoft Access.\n\nSection Four covers the new Palm VII, the first one-piece, pocket-sized, wireless Internet device ever marketed, offering cell-network-based email and Web access anywhere in the country. As this section makes clear, any PalmPilot model can access the Net when equipped with the tiny PalmPilot modem. Such an arrangement is ideal for reading and replying to email--a great time-shifter for anyone who'd otherwise consider plane, train, or automobile time as downtime. Additional chapters cover the five Palm Web browsers, paging, faxing, and infrared beaming features.\n\nSection Five explains simple ways to troubleshoot both software and hardware, including HotSync snafus and various software glitches. Special chapters cover Palm fans' options for upgrading and accessorizing their palmtops. Two new appendixes debut in this edition; one explains how to write Palm VII Web-querying applets; the other, for the first time, covers the PalmPilot's synergy with Unix and Linux machines.\n\nPalmPilot: The Ultimate Guide, 2nd Edition is the most comprehensive Palm-platform book yet written. With the cooperation of Palm Computing, and 3Com, bestselling computer-book author David Pogue succinctly answers every conceivable question, unlocks Palm features most users never suspected, and radiates the fun, passion, and sense of community shared by Piloteers the world over. The enclosed CD-ROM (for Windows 9x, NT, and the Macintosh) is a disc-based version of the #1 Palm-software Web site, palmcentral.com, offering over 3,100 programs organized in a searchable, sortable database catalog with auto-install features and web links. PalmPilot: The Ultimate Guide is the essential guide for the PalmPilot owner.","tags":["Business","Business / Personal Technology","Personal Devices","Mobile Devices / Computers","Palm"]},{"id":"9780133025132","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"My iPad® for Kids","authors":["Sam Costello"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"June 2012","description":"Step-by-step instructions and corresponding step number callouts on photos show you exactly what to do Help when you run into problems or limitations of your iPad or its apps and you need to figure out what to do Tips and Notes to help you get the most out of your iPad and its apps Costello Full-color, step-by-step tasks walk you through learning how to use your iPad for home, school, and just for fun!

Wayne Pace"],"pages":"256","publication_date":"April 2001","description":"In this era of rapid globalization, human resource development professionals in every type of organization face the problem of managing training and development across many different, often widely dispersed, sites. Training Across Multiple Locations offers a comprehensive, proven model for designing, building and assessing every aspect of a multiple location training and development (T&D) system. Stephen Krempl and R. Wayne Pace detail how to integrate training from multiple locations into a comprehensive organizational strategy, and how corporate training can align those multiple locations with a single corporate vision.Training Across Multiple Locations draws from numerous real-life examples to show how distance learning technology-including intra-nets, web-based training, and computer-based training-is being used to manage multi-point training at companies like Motorola, Ford, Boeing, Kinko's, Hewlett-Packard, and others. With technology, the authors reveal, training organizations are able to extend their reach and distribute training over a far wider audience in ways that may make current approaches to training less relevant and even obsolete. And perhaps most importantly, they provide a model for calculating return on investment (ROI) for these technology-based programs.Krempl and Pace present a detailed review process for evaluating the effectiveness of multiple location training and development systems and provide specific advice on how to conduct the review and how to share data to enhance unit effectiveness. They also include a unique questionnaire that helps teams assess how well they are carrying out their T&D responsibilities and how well they are integrating their activities into the corporate business plan.Training and development functions survive by maintaining relationships with critical decision-makers at all levels in the organization. This process is often described in terms of politics and power-but Training Across Multiple Locations treats the issue simply in terms of how to get the job done. The unique process described in this book will encourage better preparation and more informed discussions and decisions, allowing managers to better anticipate problems and stay on top of key issues.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Business Architecture"]},{"id":"9780134196961","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"My iPad (Covers iOS 9 for iPad Pro, all models of iPad Air and iPad mini, iPad 3rd/4th generation, and iPad 2), Eighth Edition","authors":["Gary Rosenzweig"],"pages":"512","publication_date":"October 2015","description":"My iPad, Eighth Edition, helps you quickly get started with your new tablet, and use its features to look up information and perform day-to-day activities from anywhere, any time.\n\nCovers iOS 9 for all models of iPad Air, iPad mini, iPad Pro, iPad 3rd/4th generation, and iPad 2Step-by-step instructions with callouts to iPad photos that show you exactly what to do.

Wired has astutely described Palm's position in a recent article: \"On its way to becoming the bestselling hand-held computer of all time, the 3Com PalmPilot has spawned an intense, emotional, and fanatical developer following not seen since the glory days of the Mac.\" (Wired, 20 Feb. 98). Palm Programming should be eagerly accepted by programmers because the authors worked closely with Palm to ensure that the book is tailored exactly to the needs of the ever-growing group of Palm developers. As nothing but some piecemeal documentation exists currently, this book provides a much needed solution to the Palm developers. In fact, Palm uses this book as their official developer's guide and will be using it in the future as a key part of their training materials for developers. There are currently no books on Palm programming (and we know of none that are planned). The only way to learn is by using the reference material published by Palm (available freely on their Web site), the tutorial they provide, or various Palm programming FAQs compiled by third parties. Palm Programming shows intermediate to experienced C programmers how to build a Palm application from the ground up. Using an easy-to- understand tutorial approach, this book gives readers everything necessary to create a wide range of Palm applications and conduits, from simple scripts through full-blown applications, and in the process provides thorough coverage of Palm programming. It includes a CD-ROM (Macintosh and Windows compatible) with the full source code to the examples in the book, a trial version of Palm's Software Development Kit, and third-party developer tools, including Metrowerks' CodeWarrior Lite programming kit.

Executives attempt to influence employees toward achieving business goals, and they attempt to prevent and detect wrongdoing, misconduct, and crime among employees. However, top-down approaches to corporate control do not work when executives and other privileged individuals in the business themselves commit and conceal their wrongdoing, misconduct, and crime in organizational settings. Then there is a need for a bottom-up approach in corporate control as outlined in this book.\n\nBottom-up control refers to the manner in which organizational members can use different types of control mechanisms – such as whistleblowing, transparency, resource access, or culture – to monitor, measure, and evaluate executives’ avoidance of deviant behaviors and influence them toward achieving the organization’s goals in efficient and effective ways.\n\nThe newly emerging perspective of a social license to operate forms part of the bottom-up strategy where criminalization becomes social property independent of the criminal justice system. The social license is predominantly centered on social permission for business activity where the media, social movements, and citizen watchdogs exert pressure, demand change, and bring top management to account.\n\nThis book presents a novel approach to corporate control of white-collar crime based on the theory of convenience. White-collar crime is financial crime committed by privileged individuals who have legitimate access to resources based on the power and trust inherent through their professional positions. Convenience theory proposes that motive, opportunity, and willingness are the three dimensions that underlie white-collar crime in an organizational context. This book contributes to the study of white-collar criminality through a blend of theoretical discussions and practical materials that illuminate and support the use of convenience theory. The book discusses how bottom-up approaches can overcome the difficulty of detecting white-collar crime and overcome the barriers of preventing executive deviance.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Business Ethics"]},{"id":"9780136824398","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"My iPhone for Seniors, 7th Edition","authors":["Brad Miser"],"pages":"752","publication_date":"December 2020","description":"Easy, clear, readable, and focused on what you want to do.\n\nStep-by-step instructions for the tasks you care about most.\n\nLarge, full-color, close-up photos with callouts to iPhone photos that show you exactly what to do.\n\nCommon-sense help when you run into iPhone problems or limitations.\n\nTips and notes to help you get the most from your iPhone.\n\nFull-color, step-by-step tasks walk you through getting and keeping your iPhone working just the way you want.

Palm and O'Reilly felt that it was important to have abook available to help developers get a basic understanding of the new Palmplatform at the time that the SDK was released; this timing played a majorrole in the content and structure of the book.Ideally this book would have been a complete reference of the new platformbut that wasn't possible since the content was written at the same time asthe software SDK was being developed by the Palm engineering team. The bookdoes provide a complete overview of Palm webOS, a thorough description ofthe application model and gives details on many key design concepts. Thereare descriptions and examples of UI widgets, services, storage,notifications, dashboards and background applications, serving as a greatintroduction but not as a definitive source.The book uses a simple News reader application to illustrate the technicaldescriptions but the examples are not intended to serve as a cookbooktutorial. Experienced developers should be able to use the examples to buildup a working application chapter by chapter but others may not find theloose descriptions adequate for recreating the application unaided. Overtime, these different needs will be filled by other books, but in themeantime we hope that this book will serve a valuable role introducingdevelopers to webOS and giving them a way of getting started with webOSapplication development.A second printing of the book will update any original coverage obsoleted bysubsequent Mojo SDK builds. For owners of the original printing of the book,all of these updates are posted on the \"View/Submit Errata\" link (please seeleft-hand column of this web page).Thanks for understanding that book publishing and coverage of rapidly movingtechnologies can sometimes be an inexact science; we knew there'd be a needfor a book such as Palm webOS: The Insider's Guide to DevelopingApplications in JavaScript using the Palm MojoT Framework, and there'scertainly no better person to write that book that Mitch Allen; that said,we understand that because it is such a new operating system and SDK, therewould (and will continue to be) changes that at best can't be documented andexplored until new printings of the books are released.

Global markets offer unlimited opportunities. But competition in these markets is intense. To be globally successful, companies must learn to operate and compete in multiple environments which may be different from the home environment. One important prerequisite for success in foreign markets is the ability to negotiate properly. Global business negotiations are affected by the cultural backgrounds of the negotiators, comprising language, cultural conditioning, negotiating style, approaches to problem solving, implicit assumptions, gestures and facial expressions, and the role of ceremony and formality. Therefore, negotiators assigned to deal with their foreign counterparts need a lot of learning and skills. With training and practice such learning and skills can be enhanced. The proposed book offers a practical guide to acquire negotiating skills. The purpose of this book is to provide consistently effective strategies and systematic approaches to negotiations that will dramatically improve international managers as negotiators. The book provides sufficient familiarity with negotiating styles that will help managers identify their unique strength and weaknesses, thus enabling them to interpret and comfortably use the latest advances in the field of negotiation in dealing internationally.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Business Negotiation"]},{"id":"0642572027094","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Elevate Report Design","authors":["Chennel Williams"],"publication_date":"July 2024","description":"This video series is all about learning to use Power BI, a Microsoft tool that helps you to turn data into valuable insights.

It is a concise story that tells what America’s multinationals did to the U.S. economy and how they did it. It is an applied and actionable book which includes many suggested solutions that function as steps the reader can take in their company.\n\nThis book is based on a promise made by multinationals in 2018 when 181 CEOs signed a commitment letter to lead their companies not just for the benefit of their investors, but for the benefit of all stakeholders: customers, employees, suppliers, communities, and shareholders.\n\nDuring the last 40 years, the American dream has been dismantled by the policies and decisions of the multinational corporations (MNCs). Instead of benefitting all stake holders, they chose to favor their shareholders over all stake holders and short-term profits over society and country. To begin this process of change to achieve these new commitments, they must first understand what corporations did wrong since 1980 that didn’t benefit the other stakeholders.\n\nThis book will provide managers a detailed summary of the problems and obstacles they will need to address and overcome if they are going to make good on their commitment to meet the needs of all stakeholders, including employees, suppliers, communities, and an economy that serves all Americans. It also offers many solutions that will help them improve their job performance.\n\nIt is in the interest of America’s multinationals to find ways to protect their technologies, reduce outsourcing, and shift their focus to playing in a long-term economic game if they want to be competitive in the future.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Business Ethics"]},{"id":"9780133124873","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"My Apple TV®","authors":["Sam Costello"],"pages":"320","publication_date":"February 2016","description":"Step-by-step instructions with callouts to Apple TV screenshots that show you exactly what to do.\n\nHelp when you run into problems or limitations.\n\nTips and Notes to help you get the most from Apple TV.\n\nFull-color, step-by-step tasks walk you through doing everything you want to do with your Apple TV.

Harmonisation began to be looked at as an attempt by one legal system to impose its values on the other. A major reason for that is the lack of understanding of the scope to which these two legal traditions converge. One of the principal findings of this book is that Shari’ah and common law have many more commonalities than differences. As a result, the need for harmonisation between the two might have been exaggerated. The similarities do not need to be harmonised. Rather, they need to be acknowledged and appreciated. If the differences between Shari’ah and common law, which undoubtedly exist as evidenced in this book, are approached from the position of appreciation for commonalities, the ambiance to reconcile the differences would be more conducive to the harmonisation process which would, in that case, be reflective of compromise. This book is intended to help readers better understand Shari’ah and common law and aid harmonization efforts when needed.","tags":["Business","Business Law"]},{"id":"9781484231869","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Developing Professional iPhone Photography: Using Photoshop, Lightroom, and other iOS and Desktop Apps to Create and Edit Photos","authors":["Rafiq Elmansy"],"pages":"397","publication_date":"December 2017","description":"Leverage the photo taking power of your iPhone with desktop and iOS apps to capture, retouch, manipulate, organize, and sell your photography.

The goal is to make you good at using Power BI to identify and visualize important insights from your data.\n\nWhy Power BI?

Not because companies are pursuing the wrong goals — but because they are going about them the wrong way. Never before have companies been more conscious of the need to run their businesses in an environmentally, socially, and economically responsible fashion. Yet never before have theory and practice been wider apart. When it comes to practicing and not just preaching sustainability, many companies struggle and most flounder in developing and implementing a sustainable business model. Many executives know and feel the importance of making their businesses sustainable. But many of them can't make the transformation occur. Worse still, many don't even know they're failing. Based on their experience and observations, the authors identify key roadblocks to embedding sustainable business models and offer a roadmap to circumvent them.\n\nAccording to the authors, companies need to recognize that sustainability is not just another change initiative. Change-management initiatives are usually driven by some external factors or by lack of internal performance and are typically directed at increasing profitability and shareholder value. Sustainability, on the other hand, is about people and planet as well, not just profit. Sustainability involves creating value for all stakeholders in the ecosystem and viewing profits as a consequence of such value creation. Sustainability also requires a business to look at its entire value chain.\n\nA company's sustainability initiative, the authors argue, should be led by the CEO and should become a priority for the board. Business executives should also strive to attract the support of the company's middle management. In addition, sustainability must apply to the entire supply chain — and even beyond, to the usage and disposal of products. Because the details are so granular, this requires the attention, effort, and creative thinking of all employees and units.\n\nOf course, one company cannot solve the world's biggest problems all by itself. Companies need to form alliances with competitors in their sustainability journey. One example: The Consumer Goods Forum, representing top retailers and consumer-goods manufacturers, came together to work toward eliminating net deforestation in members' supply chains by sustainably sourcing the commodities that drive much deforestation: palm oil, beef, soy, and timber. That commitment was made possible by companies including Unilever, Procter & Gamble, Nestle, Coca-Cola, and PepsiCo agreeing on a plan.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Business Ethics"]},{"id":"9781604912456","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Leadership in Action: Thinking Straight: New Strategies Are Needed for Ethical Leadership","authors":["Richard T.

Litow"],"pages":"208","publication_date":"June 2018","description":"A roadmap to improve corporate social responsibility The 2016 U.S. Presidential Campaign focused a good deal of attention on the role of corporations in society, from both sides of the aisle. In the lead up to the election, big companies were accused of profiteering, plundering the environment, and ignoring (even exacerbating) societal ills ranging from illiteracy and discrimination to obesity and opioid addiction. Income inequality was laid squarely at the feet of us companies. The Trump administration then moved swiftly to scrap fiscal, social, and environmental rules that purportedly hobble business, to redirect or shut down cabinet offices historically protecting the public good, and to roll back clean power, consumer protection, living wage, healthy eating initiatives and even basic public funding for public schools. To many eyes, and the lens of history, this may usher in a new era of cowboy capitalism with big companies, unfettered by regulation and encouraged by the presidential bully pulpit, free to go about the business of making money—no matter the consequences to consumers and the commonwealth. While this may please some companies in the short term, the long term consequences might result in just the opposite.\n\nAnd while the new administration promises to reduce \"foreign aid\" and the social safety net, Stanley S. Litow believes big companies will be motivated to step up their efforts to create jobs, reduce poverty, improve education and health, and address climate change issues — both domestically and around the world. For some leaders in the private sector this is not a matter of public relations or charity. It is integral to their corporate strategy—resulting in creating new markets, reducing risks, attracting and retaining top talent, and generating growth and realizing opportunities. Through case studies (many of which the author spearheaded at IBM), The Challenge for Business and Society provides clear guidance for companies to build their own corporate sustainability and social responsibility plans positively effecting their bottom lines producing real return on their investments. This book will help: • Create an effective corporate social responsibility and sustainability plan • Provide long-term bottom line benefit • Protect and enrich brand value• Recruit and retain top talent\n\nPerfect for CEOs, CFOs, Human Resource/Corporate Affairs executives, but also for government and not-for-profit leaders, this book helps you come up with a solid plan for giving back to society, producing real sustainable value.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Business Ethics"]},{"id":"9780133442472","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"My iPad® mini (covers iOS 7), Second Edition","authors":["Gary Rosenzweig"],"pages":"464","publication_date":"November 2013","description":"Covers iOS 7 Step-by-step instructions with callouts to iPad mini photos that show you exactly what to do.

By developing custom apps and features on the Yammer platform, you can make your workplace more productive, encourage communication and feedback, and get your colleagues collaborating across a range of platforms, including SharePoint, ASP.NET, and Windows Phone.\n\nThe book begins with an introduction to the development options available along with guidance on how to set up a Yammer developer account. You’ll then take your first step in Yammer integration by building a Yammer feed into a web page or other JavaScript-based client application, before diving into app creation and management on the Yammer platform.\n\nThe authors provide a deep dive into the Yammer authorization process from client-side and server-side perspectives, and you’ll find out how to work closely with Yammer’s data streams and its full range of development possibilities using Open Graph and Yammer’s REST API. The final chapters cover how to build Yammer integration into standalone applications for SharePoint and Windows Phone 8 with Yammer SDKs.\n\nAll chapters are illustrated with examples and sample code, and a case study follows the development of a workplace training application as the authors apply each technique, so you can see how to make the most of what Yammer has to offer.","tags":["Business","Business / Personal Technology","Communication / Meeting Software"]},{"id":"9780470637821","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Professional iPhone® Programming with MonoTouch and .NET/C#","authors":["Wallace B. McClure","Martin Bowling","Craig Dunn"],"pages":"383","publication_date":"July 2010","description":"What .NET C# developers need to enter the hot field of iPhone apps\n\niPhone applications offer a hot opportunity for developers. Until the open source MonoTouch project, this field was limited to those familiar with Apple's programming languages. Now .NET and C# developers can join the party. Professional iPhone Programming with MonoTouch and .NET/C#is the first book to cover MonoTouch, preparing developers to take advantage of this lucrative opportunity.\n\nThis book is for .NET developers that are interested in creating native iPhone applications written in .NET/C#. These developers want to use their existing knowledge. While .NET developers are always interested in learning, they also recognize that learning Objective-C and the specifics of the iPhone can be overwhelming. Those developers interested in MonoTouch will recognize that the cost of MonoTouch is easily made up by the ability to quickly target the iPhone using a language that they are already familiar with.\n\nThis book is designed for .NET developers that want to target the iPhone. It is designed to help you get up to speed with the iPhone, not to really teach you about the .NET Framework or C# language, which we assume you already know.\n\nThis book is designed with introductory material in Chapters 1 thru 4. You should read Chapters 1 thru 4 sequentially. These chapters introduce the MonoTouch product, the basics of developing with MonoTouch and MonoDevelop, and finally, the basics of presenting data to a user with screen and data controls and how to develop a user interface for the iPhone. Once you are comfortable with these concepts, you can typically move from one chapter to another and not necessarily have to read the chapters sequentially.\n\nChapter 1 \"Introduction to iPhone Development with MonoTouch for C# Developers\" This chapter looks at how the largest segment of developers can target the smartphone with the highest mindshare, and that the smartphone is growing faster in marketshare than any other device.\n\nChapter 2 \"Introduction to MonoTouch\" gives you a firm foundation in MonoTouch, MonoDevelop, Interface Builder, debugging, and deploying.\n\nChapter 3 \"Planning Your App's UI: Exploring the Screen Controls\" teaches you about creating your application's UI and specifically how the UI on the iPhone can differ from UIs that you might have created before. You also explore the Input & Value objects from the Interface Builder Objects Library.\n\nChapter 4 \"Data Controls\" shows the Interface Builder Objects Library Cocoa Touch classes for Controllers, Data Views, and Windows, Views, & Bars.\n\nChapter 5 \"Working with Data on the iPhone\" looks at the SQLite database engine as well as strategies to store data off the device on a central server through SOAP and REST (using XML and JSON) without tying up the user interface.\n\nChapter 6 \"Displaying Data Using Tables\" looks at displaying information in a table, using tables for navigation, taking advantage of UITableView's built-in editing features, and adding a search bar to a table.\n\nChapter 7 \"Mapping\" covers CoreLocation and MapKit, using Location Services, and adding maps and geocoding to your application.\n\nChapter 8 \"Application Settings\" focuses on application settings, and looks at two aspects of settings for your MonoTouch app: the Info.plist and your settings bundle. It covers what settings you might want to set in your Info.plist and why, and then looks at what code it takes to read and use the settings that you save in the settings bundle. And it also takes you through the building of the settings that you might have in a social media-type application. Going through each step, you will examine the Root.plist inside the Property List Editor and see the settings dialog that will result from it.\n\nChapter 9 \"Programming with Device Hardware\" covers accelerometer device orientation, and proximity detection support, networking, and developing with battery life in mind.\n\nChapter 10 \"Programming with Multimedia\" discussing integrating images and the image picker, watching and recording videos, playing and recording audio, and using animation\n\nChapter 11 \"Talking to Other Applications\" discusses the ways you can use MonoTouch to talk to other applications on the iPhone, both Apple-built applications and those downloaded from the App Store. It also provides helpful ways of accessing the iPhone's Address Book and the iPod music library.\n\nChapter 12 \"Localizing for an International Audience\" first defines internationalization and localization, then shows displaying translated text and images, formatting dates, times, and numbers, then extracting text for translation.\n\nChapter 13 \"Programming the iPad\" the capabilities of the iPad are, what new APIs and controls have been introduced that you can use in iPad-specific applications, and how to build applications that can work on both iPad and iPhone devices.\n\nChapter 14 \"Just Enough Objective-C\" provides you with a reference and introduction to Objective-C that will help you acquire an ability to comprehend Objective-C which is something that will come in very handy.\n\nChapter 15 \"The App Store: Submitting and Marketing Your App\" discusses all things App Store. First, it talks about the process that you need to go through before you are ready to submit - this includes final testing with Ad-Hoc builds and a presubmission checklist. Next it addresses actually submitting to the App Store, and then finally what to do with your app after it's in the App Store. This chapter also touches on alternative monetization strategies such as ads or in app purchases.","tags":["Business","Business / Personal Technology","Personal Devices","Mobile Devices / Computers","iPhone"]},{"id":"9780321684189","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"The iPod touch Pocket Guide","authors":["Christopher Breen"],"pages":"288","publication_date":"November 2009","description":"Here is the essential companion to the iPod touch and iTunes 9.

As a result, graduates of higher business schools are totally unaware of the risk associated with management misconduct that often results in corrupt scandals, erosion of public trust to their organizations, or even the collapse of profitable corporations. The last decade, in fact, has been abundant in numerous examples of corruption scandals in modern organizations and instances of management misconduct that have eroded public faith (such as Enron, WorldCom, Tyco, Adelphia, Arthur Andersen, and Parmalat). Due to repeated misconducts and a highly active dark side, scholars started paying more attention to the so-called Òdark sideÓ of organizations, as something no longer exceptional to organizational life. This book attempts to shed light on the reality of challenges for business practices and higher education management that stem from misconduct occurring in various aspects of business and educational environment.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Business Ethics"]},{"id":"9780321534101","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"The iPhone Book: How to Do the Things You Want to Do with Your iPhone","authors":["Scott Kelby","Terry White"],"pages":"240","publication_date":"August 2007","description":"There are basically two types of iPhone books out there: (1) The “Tell-me-all-about-it” kind, which includes in-depth discussions on everything from wireless network protocols to advanced compression codes.

Edward Freeman","Ellen R. Auster"],"pages":"216","publication_date":"August 2015","description":"Bridging the Values Gap Business has a values problem. It's not just spectacular public scandals like Enron (which, incidentally, had a great corporate values statement). Many companies fail to live up to the standards they set for themselves, alienating the public and leaving employees cynical and disengaged—resulting in lower productivity, less innovation, and sometimes outright corruption. The reason, argue top scholars and consultants Edward Freeman and Ellen Auster, is that all too often values are handed down from on high, with little employee input, discussion, or connection to the challenges and opportunities facing the organization. Although the words may be well-intentioned, they aren't reflected in the everyday practices, policies, and processes of the organization. This practically invites disconnects between intention and reality. To bridge this gap between the “talk” and the “walk”, Freeman and Auster provide a process through which organizations can collectively surface deeply held values that truly resonate with everyone, from top to bottom. Their Values Through Conversation (VTC) process focuses on four key types of values conversations: introspective (reflecting on ourselves and how we do things in the organization), historical (exploring our understanding of our past and how it impacts us), connectedness (creating a strong community where we work well together), and aspirational (sharing our hopes and dreams). By developing values through discussions—casual or formal, one-on-one or in groups—VTC ensures that values are dynamic and evolving, not static words on a wall or a website. Freeman and Auster offer advice, real-world examples, and sample questions to help you create values that are authentic and embraced because they are rooted in the lived experience of the organization.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Business Ethics"]},{"id":"01520110044SI","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Right Thing?

Huntsman's generous about sharing the credit, but in the 21st century, he's the nearest thing to a self-made multi-billionaire. Now, he presents the lessons of a lifetime: a passionate, inspirational manifesto for returning to the days when your word was your bond, a handshake was sacred, and swarms of lawyers weren't needed to back it up. This is no mere exhortation: it's a practical business book about how to listen to your moral compass, even as others ignore theirs. It's about how you build teams with the highest values, share success, take responsibility, and earn the rewards that only come with giving back. Huntsman's built his career and fortune on these principles.  You don't live these principles just to 'succeed': you live them because they're right.

Recognizing that families may simultaneously own or control multiple businesses as well as substantial wealth beyond these firms in the form of financial and non-financial assets, this handbook focuses on business families rather than the narrower construct of family business. The contributions in this handbook explore the relatively neglected dynamics between individuals with family ties that shape the interaction between family and business; business families with multiple businesses; how business families adopt formal rules and processes around their joint activities; and the institutionalization of wealth and business families in society.\n\nThe De Gruyter Handbook of Business Families fills a gap in the family business research literature and is an essential reference work for researchers and graduate-level students in the area of business families.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Business Architecture"]},{"id":"9781457182020","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"The Art of iPhone Photography","authors":["Bob Weil","Nicki Fitz-Gerald"],"pages":"352","publication_date":"August 2013","description":"The Art of iPhone Photography explores how 45 of today's best iPhonegraphers from around the world conceived, composed, and created some of their finest and best-known pieces-all in their own words.

The rewards of unethical behavior are often greater than the price paid for misbehavior. This book explains why leaders, seeking to run ethical and successful organizations, cannot depend only on the law and their organizations to make moral business decisions.\n\nThe authors explore why making ethical business decisions is harder than is generally understood, and explores the difficulties leaders face as a result of differences in context, circumstances, and other challenges to ethical behavior, such as misleading rhetoric, inappropriate role models, cognitive dissonance and motivated forgetting. They argue that individuals need to establish ethical baselines that they will not cross when making decisions and explain how to do this systematically.\n\nThe Challenge of Leading an Ethical and Successful Organization offers ways of handling ethical dilemmas successfully. It explores the need to determine in advance the potential areas of ethical conflict, and the potential costs of such conflicts and provides leaders with a practical ethical framework to reconcile ethics with business success. This book is essential reading for professionals, consultants, and academics interested in the ethics of leadership and management.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Business Ethics"]},{"id":"9780768683790","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"The Upgrader’s Guide to Microsoft Office System 2003","authors":["Mike Gunderloy","Susan Sales Harkins"],"pages":"360","publication_date":"August 2004","description":"Microsoft Office 2003 is the sixth version of Microsoft's best-selling Office suite.

Firms pursuing cross-border activities in any capacity, and to whatever degree or scale, are increasingly coming into contact with differences in morally applied decision making that affects their operational success and sustainability. The  choices made require the use of clear and unambiguous codes of conduct for embedded managers abroad. The  implementation of a properly administered code, coupled with a program of corporate social responsibility (CSR), can add value to a company, while its misapplication or exclusion can diminish value.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Business Ethics"]},{"id":"9781637424391","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Journey to the Metaverse","authors":["Antonio Flores-Galea"],"pages":"202","publication_date":"March 2023","description":"The Metaverse will be the next technological revolution.

The answers given by business people from different cultural backgrounds to these questions are likely to differ from the standard answers found in business manuals.\n\nIn her book, Milene Mendes de Oliveira investigates how Brazilian and German business people conceptualize and act out business negotiations using English as a Lingua Franca. The frameworks of Cultural Linguistics, English as a Lingua Franca, World Englishes, and Business Discourse offer the theoretical and methodological grounding for the analysis of interviews with high-ranking Brazilian and German business people. Moreover, a side study on e-mail exchanges between Brazilian and German employees of a healthcare company serves as a test case for the results arising from the interviews, and helps understand other facets of authentic intercultural business communication.\n\nOffering new insights on English as a Lingua Franca in international business contexts, Business Negotiations in ELF from a Cultural Linguistic Perspective simultaneously provides a detailed cultural-conceptual account of business negotiations from the viewpoint of Brazilian and German business people and a secondary analysis of their pragmatic aspects.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Business Negotiation"]},{"id":"9783110572421","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Business Ethics 3.0","authors":["Erhard Meyer-Galow"],"pages":"245","publication_date":"May 2018","description":"The reputation of business managers is declining due to their disregard for moral decisions and ethical practices. Business students are currently taught only technical knowledge without concern for being compassionately and holistic engaged. However, when entering the business sector these graduates encounter a world which necessitates difficult, personally challenging decisions, ones for which technical knowledge is insufficient.\n\nSuccessful, sustainable resolutions can only be expected to result from a holistic, sustainable approach which accommodates the difficulty in balancing ethical practices with the demands for ever-increasing profits.\n\nThis unique graduate textbook addresses the issue of business ethics from the perspective of an individual’s internal growth facilitated by a consideration of the principles of depth psychology, spiritual wisdom, meditation, and quantum physics, written by a CEO with an enormous business background.\n\nIt not only promotes a new ethical approach, but also addresses the implementation of this new approach in the most important business sectors as a replacement for previous ineffective codes of conduct which have failed.\n\nIt’s a must read for business students with aspirations of becoming managers or entrepreneurs in the economic sector as well as for all young professionals, managers and entrepreneurs to improve their ethical performance and sustainable success.\n\nMessage from the author\n\nThis book creates an impetus for change in a business world where unethical practices are rampant by providing a suggested a New Integral Ethics for the economy, an ethical approach based upon inner psychological and spiritual development arising from a serious consideration of Depth Psychology.\n\nReaders will learn how adoption of specific Practices, which lead to inner growth and spiritual maturity, will result in ethical, morally sound business practices not because they are mandated, but because once the SELF is actualized, you cannot do otherwise. Laws, appeals and directives which have never successfully resulted in ethical practices become unnecessary, replaced by intrinsically ethical individuals who collectively influence corporate ethical behaviour. This is a giant leap into a new dimension in our globalized, digitized economy.\n\n\"Business Ethics 3.0, by Erhard Meyer-Galow provides a much needed beacon of light to a segment of our society that seem to be sinking deeper and deeper into darkness. The term \"business ethics\", once an important topic within the business community, has slowly descended through the fog of profitable ends justifying unprincipled means to become nothing more than a self-contradictory oxymoron -- especially among large international corporations. In Business Ethics 3.0, Erhard Meyer-Galow has taken a fresh approach that appeals to individual personal growth rather than the usual proffering of academic arguments that are not implementable in the real world of relentless Machiavellian competition. Only through raising and improving individual awareness and responsibility can real long-term change have a chance of developing. Business Ethics 3.0 is on the right track with a positive and compelling message…may it succeed where the academics have failed.\"Thomas Campbell, physicist, consciousness researcher, author of My big TOE\n\nFinalist at the 2018 Humanistic Management Book Awards","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Business Ethics"]},{"id":"9781631575679","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Dark Sides of Business and Higher Education Management, Volume II","authors":["Agata Stachowicz-Stanusch","Gianluigi Mangia"],"pages":"214","publication_date":"September 2016","description":"Contemporary management studies usually focus on positive and desirable solutions that increase the organizational effectiveness and performance. As a result, graduates of higher business schools are totally unaware of the risk associated with management misconduct that often results in corrupt scandals, erosion of public trust to their organizations, or even the collapse of profitable corporations. The last decade, in fact, has been abundant in numerous examples of corruption scandals in modern organizations and instances of management misconduct that have eroded public faith (such as Enron, WorldCom, Tyco, Adelphia, Arthur Andersen, and Parmalat). Due to repeated misconducts and a highly active dark side, scholars started paying more attention to the so-called Òdark sideÓ of organizations, as something no longer exceptional to organizational life.
