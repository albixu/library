These changes are delivering manufacturing firms the competitive advantage of a highly flexible and responsive supply chain and manufacturing system to ensure that they meet the high expectations of their customers, who, in today's economy, demand absolutely the best service, price, delivery time and product quality.To make e-manufacturing and supply chain technologies effective, integration is needed between various, often disparate systems. To understand why this is such an issue, one needs to understand what the different systems or system components do, their objectives, their specific focus areas and how they interact with other systems. It is also required to understand how these systems evolved to their current state, as the concepts used during the early development of systems and technology tend to remain in place throughout the life-cycle of the systems/technology. This book explores various standards, concepts and techniques used over the years to model systems and hierarchies in order to understand where they fit into the organization and supply chain. It looks at the specific system components and the ways in which they can be designed and graphically depicted for easy understanding by both information technology (IT) and non-IT personnel.Without a good implementation philosophy, very few systems add any real benefit to an organization, and for this reason the ways in which systems are implemented and installation projects managed are also explored and recommendations are made as to possible methods that have proven successful in the past. The human factor and how that impacts on system success are also addressed, as is the motivation for system investment and subsequent benefit measurement processes.Finally, the vendor/user supply/demand within the e-manufacturing domain is explored and a method is put forward that enables the reduction of vendor bias during the vendor selection process.The objective of this book is to provide the reader with a good understanding regarding the four critical factors (business/physical processes, systems supporting the processes, company personnel and company/personal performance measures) that influence the success of any e-manufacturing implementation, and the synchronization required between these factors.· Discover how to implement the flexible and responsive supply chain and manufacturing execution systems required for competitive and customer-focused manufacturing· Build a working knowledge of the latest plant automation, manufacturing execution systems (MES) and supply chain management (SCM) design techniques· Gain a fuller understanding of the four critical factors (business and physical processes, systems supporting the processes, company personnel, performance measurement) that influence the success of any e-manufacturing implementation, and how to evaluate and optimize all four factors","tags":["Business","Operations","Supply Chain Management"]},{"id":"9781118133965","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Fixed Income Securities: Tools for Today's Markets, 3rd Edition","authors":["Angel Serrat","Bruce Tuckman"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"November 2011","description":"Fixed income practitioners need to understand the conceptual frameworks of their field; to master its quantitative tool-kit; and to be well-versed in its cash-flow and pricing conventions.

The book presents theory without unnecessary abstraction; quantitative techniques with a minimum of mathematics; and conventions at a useful level of detail.\n\nThe book begins with an overview of global fixed income markets and continues with the fundamentals, namely, arbitrage pricing, interest rates, risk metrics, and term structure models to price contingent claims. Subsequent chapters cover individual markets and securities: repo, rate and bond forwards and futures, interest rate and basis swaps, credit markets, fixed income options, and mortgage-backed-securities.\n\nFixed Income Securities, Third Edition is full of examples, applications, and case studies. Practically every quantitative concept is illustrated through real market data. This practice-oriented approach makes the book particularly useful for the working professional.\n\nThis third edition is a considerable revision and expansion of the second. Most examples have been updated. The chapters on fixed income options and mortgage-backed securities have been considerably expanded to include a broader range of securities and valuation methodologies. Also, three new chapters have been added: the global overview of fixed income markets; a chapter on corporate bonds and credit default swaps; and a chapter on discounting with bases, which is the foundation for the relatively recent practice of discounting swap cash flows with curves based on money market rates.\n\n[FOR THE UNIVERSITY EDITION]\n\nThis university edition includes problems which students can use to test and enhance their understanding of the text.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Financial Markets","Securities"]},{"id":"9781118237618","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Complete CPA Reference","authors":["Nick A.

Digital monopolies like Google, Facebook and Amazon act as gatekeepers to the digital world. Amazon is capturing almost all online shopping dollars. We have the illusion of choice, but for most critical decisions, we have only one or two companies, when it comes to high speed Internet, health insurance, medical care, mortgage title insurance, social networks, Internet searches, or even consumer goods like toothpaste. Every day, the average American transfers a little of their pay check to monopolists and oligopolists. The solution is vigorous anti-trust enforcement to return America to a period where competition created higher economic growth, more jobs, higher wages and a level playing field for all. The Myth of Capitalism is the story of industrial concentration, but it matters to everyone, because the stakes could not be higher. It tackles the big questions of: why is the US becoming a more unequal society, why is economic growth anemic despite trillions of dollars of federal debt and money printing, why the number of start-ups has declined, and why are workers losing out.","tags":["Business","Economics"]},{"id":"9781119800200","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Beyond Emotional Intelligence","authors":["S.

Program managers who emphasize activities around relationship building and stakeholder engagement usually have the best chance for program success. This book focuses on how to engage your stakeholders in the right way, and keep them engaged throughout the course of your program.\n\nThe first section of the book covers stakeholder engagement in the program definition phase, including how to identify key stakeholders, gain their trust, and build relationships through effective communication. The second section moves to the project execution phase. It explains how to drive stakeholder engagement through the use of performance metrics, effective meeting management, and informal program governance.\n\nIn the last section, the author explains how to keep stakeholders engaged through the program closure phase. This section covers the operational readiness review, including transition plans, new process documentation and training, new technology rollout, and cultural readiness assessment. It also provides best practices and tips for holding the post-launch review and lessons learned session.

Morrison III","Joseph W. Koletar"],"pages":"271","publication_date":"September 2013","description":"Get practical insights on the psychology of white-collar criminals—and how to outsmart them\n\nUnderstand how the psychologies of fraudsters and their victims interact as well as what makes auditors/investigators/regulators let down their guard. Learn about the psychology of fraud victims, including boards of directors and senior management, and what makes them want to believe fraudsters, and therefore making them particularly vulnerable to deception. Just as IT experts gave us computer forensics, we now have a uniquely qualified team immersed in psychology, sociology, psychiatry as well as accounting and auditing, introducing the emerging field of behavioral forensics to address the phenomenon of fraud.\n\nEver wonder what makes a white-collar criminal tick? Why does she or he do what they do? For the first time ever, see the mind of the fraudster laid bare, including their sometimes twisted rationalizations; think like a crook to catch a crook! The A.B.C.'s of Behavioral Forensics takes you there, with expert advice from a diverse but highly specialized authoring team of professionals (three out of the four are Certified Fraud Examiners): a former accounting firm partner who has a PhD in psychology, a former FBI special agent who has been with investigative practices of two of the Big Four firms, an industrial psychiatrist who has worked closely with the C-level suite of large and small companies, and an accounting professor who has interviewed numerous convicted felons. Along with a fascinating exploration of what makes people fall for the common and not-so-common swindles, the book provides a sweeping characterization of the ecology of fraud using The A.B.C.'s of Behavioral Forensics paradigm: the bad Apple (rogue executive), the bad Bushel (groups that collude and behave like gangs), and the bad Crop (representing organization-wide or even societally-sanctioned cultures that are toxic and corrosive). The book will make you take a longer look when hiring new employees and offers a deeper more complex understanding of what happens in organizations and in their people. The A.B.C. model will also help those inside and outside organizations inoculate against fraud and make you reflect on instilling the core values of your organization among your people and create a culture of excellence and integrity that acts as a prophylactic against fraud. Ultimately, you will discover that, used wisely, behavioral methods trump solely economic incentives. With business fraud on the rise globally, The A.B.C.'s of Behavioral Forensics is the must-have book for investigators, auditors, the C-suite and risk management professionals, the boards of directors, regulators, and HR professionals.\n\nExamines the psychology of fraud in a practical way, relating it to aspects of fraud prevention, deterrence, detection, and remediation\n\nHelps you understand that trust violation—the essence of fraud—is a betrayal of behavioral assumptions about \"trusted\" people\n\nExplains how good people go bad and how otherwise honest people cross the line\n\nUnderscores the importance of creating a culture of excellence and integrity that inoculates an organization from fraud risk (i.e., honest behavior pays, while dishonesty is frowned upon)\n\nProvides key takeaways on what to look for when hiring new employees and in your current employees, as well as creating and maintaining a culture of control consciousness\n\nIncludes narrative accounts of interviews with convicted white-collar criminals, as well as interpretive insights and analysis of their rationalizations\n\nFurnishes ideas about how to enhance professional skepticism, how to resist fraudsters, how to see through their schemes, how to infuse internal controls with the people/behavioral element, and make them more effective in addressing behavioral/integrity risks\n\nProvides a solid foundation for training programs across the fraud risk management life cycle all the way from the discovery of fraud to its investigation as well as remediation (so the same fraud doesn't happen again)\n\nEnables auditors/investigators to engage in self-reflection and avoid cognitive and emotional biases and traps that lead to professional judgment errors (e.g., overconfidence, confirmation, self-deception, groupthink, halo effect, availability, speed-accuracy trade-off, etc.)\n\nEver since the accounting scandals surrounding Enron and WorldCom surfaced, leading to the passage of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, as well as the continuing fall out from the Wall Street financial crisis precipitating the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, fraud has been a leading concern for executives globally.

Not only is this taking a toll on performance, it’s impacting your sense of well-being outside the office. It’s time to reclaim control.Dr. Hallowell now identifies the underlying reasons why people lose their ability to focus at work.

Based on his years of helping clients develop constructive ways to deal with distraction, Dr. Hallowell provides a set of practical and reliable techniques to show how to sustain a productive mental state. In Part 1 of the book, he identifies the six most common ways people lose the ability to focus at work—what he calls “screen sucking” (internet/social media addiction), multitasking, idea hopping (never finishing what you start), worrying, playing the hero, and dropping the ball—and he explains the underlying psychological and emotional dynamics driving each behavior. Part 2 of the book provides advice for “training” your attention overall, so that you are less susceptible to surrendering it, in any situation. The result is a book that will empower you to combat each one of these common syndromes—and clear a path for you to achieve your highest personal and professional goals.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Development","Personal Productivity"]},{"id":"9780132619165","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"The Option Trader’s Work Book: A Problem-Solving Approach, Second Edition","authors":["Jeff Augen"],"pages":"304","publication_date":"October 2011","description":"Successful options trading requires extensive practice.

In Achieving Supply Chain Integration, leading experts reveal what works and how to make it work.\n\nThe authors and contributors clarify what supply chain integration really means, and why it’s even more crucial than many companies realize.

This book champions Radical Product Thinking, a systematic methodology for building visionary, game-changing products.Methodologies such as Lean and Agile have democratized innovation by teaching us to harness the power of iteration to innovate faster, but our ability to set a clear destination hasn't kept up with the pace. When we iterate without a clear vision or strategy, our products become bloated, fragmented, and driven by irrelevant metrics. They catch “product diseases” that are often fatal to true innovation. In Radical Product Thinking (RPT), product development is led by the vision for the change it's intended to create. This methodology helps leaders reimagine the problems they face and align their team to find creative solutions using five elements: Vision, Strategy, Prioritization, Execution, and Culture. R. Dutt guides readers through these elements so they develop a clear process for achieving their desired change, incorporate it into daily activities, and turn RPT skills into muscle memory. This book gives organizations a repeatable model for building vision-driven products by helping us systematically translate vision and strategy into everyday actions so our product becomes a vehicle for creating the change we want to see in the world.

Others are more difficult. And then there are situations that seem completely hopeless. Conflict is escalating, people are getting aggressive, and no one is willing to back down. And to top it off, you have little power or other resources to work with. Harvard professor and negotiation adviser Deepak Malhotra shows how to defuse even the most potentially explosive situations and to find success when things seem impossible.Malhotra identifies three broad approaches for breaking deadlocks and resolving conflicts, and draws out scores of actionable lessons using behind-the-scenes stories of fascinating real-life negotiations, including drafting of the US Constitution, resolving the Cuban Missile Crisis, ending bitter disputes in the NFL and NHL, and beating the odds in complex business situations. But he also shows how these same principles and tactics can be applied in everyday life, whether you are making corporate deals, negotiating job offers, resolving business disputes, tackling obstacles in personal relationships, or even negotiating with children.As Malhotra reminds us, regardless of the context or which issues are on the table, negotiation is always, fundamentally, about human interaction. No matter how high the stakes or how protracted the dispute, the object of negotiation is to engage with other human beings in a way that leads to better understandings and agreements. The principles and strategies in this book will help you do this more effectively in every situation.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Business Negotiation"]},{"id":"9781789133936","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Implementing Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central On-Premise - Fourth Edition","authors":["Alex Chow","Roberto Stefanetti"],"pages":"764","publication_date":"December 2018","description":"\"Implementing Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central On-Premise\" offers a detailed guide for system administrators, developers, and consultants to understand and utilize Microsoft Dynamics NAV and Dynamics 365 Business Central.

The author presents the theories of stochastic processes and stochastic calculus and provides the necessary tools for modeling and pricing in finance and insurance. Practical in focus, the book's emphasis is on application, intuition, and computation, rather than theory.\n\nConsequently, the text is of interest to graduate students, researchers, and practitioners interested in these areas. While the text is self-contained, an introductory course in probability theory is beneficial to prospective readers.\n\nThis book evolved from the author's experience as an instructor and has been thoroughly classroom-tested. Following an introduction, the author sets forth the fundamental information and tools needed by researchers and practitioners working in the financial and insurance industries:\n\nOverview of Probability Theory\n\nDiscrete-Time stochastic processes\n\nContinuous-time stochastic processes\n\nStochastic calculus: basic topics\n\nThe final two chapters, Stochastic Calculus: Advanced Topics and Applications in Insurance, are devoted to more advanced topics. Readers learn the Feynman-Kac formula, the Girsanov's theorem, and complex barrier hitting times distributions. Finally, readers discover how stochastic analysis and principles are applied in practice through two insurance examples: valuation of equity-linked annuities under a stochastic interest rate environment and calculation of reserves for universal life insurance.\n\nThroughout the text, figures and tables are used to help simplify complex theory and pro-cesses. An extensive bibliography opens up additional avenues of research to specialized topics.\n\nIdeal for upper-level undergraduate and graduate students, this text is recommended for one-semester courses in stochastic finance and calculus. It is also recommended as a study guide for professionals taking Causality Actuarial Society (CAS) and Society of Actuaries (SOA) actuarial examinations.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance"]},{"id":"9780470666791","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"The Handbook of News Analytics in Finance","authors":["Gautam Mitra","Leela Mitra"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"May 2011","description":"The Handbook of News Analytics in Finance is a landmark publication bringing together the latest models and applications of News Analytics for asset pricing, portfolio construction, trading and risk control.\n\nThe content of the Hand Book is organised to provide a rapid yet comprehensive understanding of this topic.

Although everyone talks about employee experience nobody has really been able to explain concretely what it is and how to go about designing for it...until now.\n\nHow can organizations truly create a place where employees want to show up to work versus need to show up to work? For decades the business world has focused on measuring employee engagement meanwhile global engagement scores remain at an all time low despite all the surveys and institutes that been springing up tackle this problem. Clearly something is not working. Employee engagement has become the short-term adrenaline shot that organizations turn to when they need to increase their engagement scores. Instead, we have to focus on designing employee experiences which is the long term organizational design that leads to engaged employees. This is the only long-term solution. Organizations have been stuck focusing on the cause instead of the effect. The cause is employee experience; the effect is an engaged workforce.\n\nBacked by an extensive research project that looked at over 150 studies and articles, featured extensive interviews with over 150 executives, and analyzed over 250 global organizations, this book clearly breaks down the three environments that make up every single employee experience at every organization around the world and how to design for them. These are the cultural, technological, and physical environments. This book explores the attributes that organizations need to focus on in each one of these environments to create COOL spaces, ACE technology, and a CELEBRATED culture. Featuring exclusive case studies, unique frameworks, and never before seen research, The Employee Experience Advantage guides readers on a journey of creating a place where people actually want to show up to work.\n\nReaders will learn:\n\nThe trends shaping employee experience\nHow to evaluate their own employee experience using the Employee Experience Score\nWhat the world's leading organizations are doing around employee experience\nHow to design for technology, culture, and physical spaces\nThe role people analytics place in employee experience\nFrameworks for how to actually create employee experiences\nThe role of the gig economy\nThe future of employee experience\nNine types of organizations that focus on employee experience\nAnd much more!\n\nThere is no question that engaged employees perform better, aspire higher, and achieve more, but you can't create employee engagement without designing employee experiences first. It's time to rethink your strategy and implement a real-world framework that focuses on how to create an organization where people want to show up to work. The Employee Experience Advantage shows you how to do just that.","tags":["Business","Human Resources","Talent Management"]},{"id":"9781119800903","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Hiring for Diversity","authors":["Arthur Woods","Susanna Tharakan","Jennifer Brown"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"August 2021","description":"You want to build a more diverse organization, but how will you shift your hiring practices?

At its core, the magnitude of your success is based on the quality of your decisions. The problem is that human beings are poor decision-makers; we tend to approach problems after they arise instead of planning for them in advance. We put too much weight on instinct, belief, and \"gut feeling.\" We make the same mistakes over and over again—so reliably, in fact, that cognitive science can accurately predict exactly which mistakes we'll make and when. This book offers a way to understand and plan for the human mind's usual tendencies to help you make smarter investment decisions. Using a framework based on cognitive research, you'll learn how to approach decisions objectively, systematically, and constantly review your process; you'll take action based on evidence instead of intuition, and get ahead of potential problems before they get the best of you.\n\nWith so much riding on the correctness of your choices, natural tendency can be a dangerous thing. This book shows you how to remove the bias and emotion to start making choices backed by hard evidence and objective data and lower your stress.\n\nShift your processes from reactive to proactive\nBase decisions on reality over belief\nEliminate cognitive bias and reduce common mistakes\nMake better decisions with a systematic, objective approach\n\nWhy do we begin managing risk only once it becomes apparent? Why do we react to the market instead of making the big decisions before emotion takes over? Investing has always been a largely reactive field, but those who dominate it approach decision-making less like a human and more like a machine. AlphaBrain shows you how to get real about investing, with cognitive techniques that lead to smarter, evidence-based decisions.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Development","Critical Thinking"]},{"id":"9780470170922","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Sarbanes-Oxley Internal Controls: Effective Auditing with AS5, CobiT, and ITIL","authors":["Robert R.

But despite this, there are very few capital allocation experts on the boards of the largest publicly traded companies, and academic research consistently finds that most firms deploy capital sub-optimally.\n\nCapital Allocation aims to educate senior leaders, board members, investors, students, and anyone interested in business on this important topic. Until now very little has been written on capital allocation outside of academia, even though the strategic deployment of excess capital is an increasingly significant source of competitive advantage for many companies.\n\nDavid Giroux, Chief Investment Officer for Equities and Multi-Asset and Head of Investment Strategy at T.

Capital Allocation walks you through this critical topic from beginning to end, including:\n\nStories of companies that allocated capital in ways that created significant shareholder value\nSeveral real-life decision-making models you can use for strategically allocating your firm’s capital\nGuidelines for generating high returns in the long term to build sustainable shareholder wealth\nGiroux uses academic research, personal experience, and uncomplicated mathematics to reveal approaches and actions that create long-term value. He provides case studies from Kodak, Comcast, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Danaher, General Electric, Microsoft, and others showing how capital allocation has―and hasn’t―worked in real-life situations. And he shows how to use capital allocation to head off possible activist investors.\n\nCapital Allocation offers everything you need to know for deploying capital wisely to outperform your competitors over the long term.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Corporate Valuation"]},{"id":"9781422191507","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"HBR's 10 Must Reads on Innovation (with featured article \"The Discipline of Innovation,\" by Peter F.

Conversely, how do senior leaders describe the kind of leader that undercuts the organization’s capacity and capability to create its future? This book, based on groundbreaking research, shows how senior leaders describe and develop leadership that works, that does not, that scales, and that limits scale.\n\nIs your leadership built for scale as you advance in today’s volatile, uncertain, dynamic, and disruptive business environment? This context puts a premium on a very particular kind of leadership—High-Creative leadership capable of rapidly growing the organization while simultaneously transforming it into more agile, innovative, adaptive and engaging workplace. The research presented in this book suggests that senior leaders can describe the High-Creative leadership with surprising clarity. They also describe with equal precision the High-Reactive leadership that cancels itself out and seriously limits scale. Which type of leader are you?\n\nYou scale your leadership by increasing the multiple on your leadership in three ways. First, by developing the strengths that differentiate the most effective leaders from the strengths deployed by the most Reactive and ineffective leaders. And second, by increasing your leadership ratio—the ratio of most the effective strengths to the most damaging liabilities. Third, by developing High-Creative leaders all around you.\n\nScaling Leadership provides a proven framework for magnifying agile and scalable leadership in your organization.

It packages practical lessons, theoretical knowledge, and historical context, all into one compelling and hopefully entertaining book. The book includes conversations with investors and management teams. Investors include activists, financials specialists, credit investors, and multibillion-dollar asset managers. Management teams have a broad representation from the c-suite of a broad spectrum of participants ranging from a fintech to a bank with over $30bn in assets.\n\nBanks are the oil that lubricates the economy. An understanding of how they operate is essential for analyzing any part of the economy since banks represent a large investing universe and control a sizeable portion of assets. With over 800 public tickers representing over $3 trillion market cap, banks are larger than several other industry groups. Banks are the largest financial intermediaries in the U.S., controlling $15 trillion in financial assets. Their relative size can amplify effects. For example, a small regulatory or environmental change can cascade and ripple through financial markets and have a major impact on the economy.\n\nAs fintechs gain in prominence, a fundamental grasp of topics related to banking will help enhance understanding of fintech.\n\nBank investing can be a fruitful pursuit:\n\nThe most successful investor of our times, Warren Buffett, has had a sizeable investment in banks over time (close to a third of his portfolio weight used to be in banks).\nBanks allow you to make macro-economic bets since they are highly levered to business cycles.\nBank investing allows you to scale your knowledge, as they have relatively homogenized business models...\n...at the same time, banks are diverse enough to drive meaningful dispersion in price performance. This divergence of performance can be taken advantage of by an astute and prepared securities analyst.\nBanks are good vehicles to make specific investment plays on geographic regions, demographic trends (suburban to urban migration, aging), industries (agriculture, tech, energy), news flow (trade/tariffs, weather), real estate subsectors (NYC office, bay area apartments), and investing themes such as ESG, cryptocurrency, and venture capital.\nFinally, fintech disruption is creating an investing opportunity to play the digital divide between banks that embrace technology successfully and those that get left behind.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Financial Markets","Securities"]},{"id":"9781119278337","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Marketing Performance","authors":["Thomas Bauer","Tjark Freundt","Jonathan Gordon"],"pages":"200","publication_date":"July 2016","description":"Drive marketing ROI with an investor's mindset and a proven toolkit\n\nTop marketers today don't shy away from financial accountability.

It is clear that some people have learned how to combine work and family in ways that are mutually supporting--at least much of the time--and some employers have created work environments and policies that make positive interdependence of these two spheres more likely to occur. This book discusses measures of work-family, conflict, policies designed to reduce conflict, comparisons with other industrialized nations, and reasons why family-friendly work-policies have not been adopted with enthusiasm. The purpose is to consider a broad range of topics that pertain to work and family with the goal of helping employers and working families understand the work-life options that are available so they can make choices that offer returns-on-investments to employers, families, and society at large that are consistent with personal and societal values.This book brings together a superb panel of experts from different disciplines to look at work and family issues and the way they interact. Part I is an overview--with a brief discussion by a psychologist, economist, and a political scientist--each of whom provide their own interpretation of how their discipline views this hybrid field. Part II considers the business case of the question of why employers should invest in family-friendly work policies, followed by a section on the employer response to work family interactions. Families are the focus of the Part IV, followed by a look at children--many of whom are at the heart of work and family interaction.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Development","Life-Work Balance"]},{"id":"9781040098639","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Leadership Humility","authors":["Andrew J.

So says Joseph Jaffe, bestselling author of Life After the 30-Second Spot and Join the Conversation, and a leading expert and thought leader on new media and social media. In most businesses, it costs roughly five-to-ten times more to acquire a new customer than it does to retain an existing one, and yet companies continue to disproportionately spend their budgets into the \"wrong\" end of the funnel – the mass media or awareness side.\n\nWhat we haven't paid enough attention to is the \"right\" end of the funnel-the word-of-mouth component that essentially acts as a multiplier for future business. The economic impact of an active, engaged and loyal customer is tremendous.\n\nAnd the same is true of the opposite scenario, namely the impact of angry customers and negative word-of-mouth or referrals. It is this thinking that Jaffe has channeled to challenge marketers to \"flip the funnel\" once and for all. With a renewed focus and energy on customer experience, it is possible to grow your sales, while decreasing your budget – in other words, getting more from less. Engaging a few customers to spread the word to many.\n\nUsing this new \"flipped funnel\" model, together with a set of new rules of customer service and a revolutionary customer referral and activation process, you'll learn how to transform your existing customers into your best salespeople. In addition, Jaffe will explain how to best introduce and combine both digital and social media tools to boost your loyalty arsenal, deploy \"influencer marketing\" and implement word-of-mouth strategies that inspire your loyal, opinionated, and most vocal customers to become credible, persuasive, and influential endorsers of your products and services.\n\nExplains how to cut your marketing budget AND grow sales!\nIllustrates practical ways to use existing customers to reach out to new prospects\nOutlines the authentic role of social media\nDemonstrates key ideas with rich, real life examples including Comcast, Apple, The Obama Campaign, Dell, Panasonic, American Airlines, Delta Airlines, Johnson & Johnson, Coca-Cola and many, many more\nWritten by one of the most sought-after consultants, keynote speakers, and thought-leaders on new marketing change and innovation; renowned blogger and podcaster at Jaffe Juice (www.jaffejuice.com) and host/presenter of web video show, JaffeJuiceTV (www.jaffejuice.tv)\n\nVisit www.flipthefunnelnow.com to join the conversation.","tags":["Business","Project & Product Management","Product Management","Customer Experience"]},{"id":"9781633690776","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"HBR Guide to Negotiating (HBR Guide Series)","authors":["Jeff Weiss"],"pages":"208","publication_date":"January 2016","description":"Forget about the hard bargain.\n\nWhether you’re discussing the terms of a high-stakes deal, forming a key partnership, asking for a raise, or planning a family event, negotiating can be stressful.

These samples of his talks and lectures, because they were spoken not written, will be new to almost all of us. A great and unexpected treat.\"-Charles Handy, author of Myself and Other More Important Matters\n\n\"Peter Drucker's ideas continue to resonate powerfully today. His lectures on effectiveness, innovation, the social sector, education and so much more provide fresh insights that extend beyond his other writings and provide lessons for us all. This book is a gem.\"-Wendy Kopp, CEO and founder of Teach for America\n\n\"Rick Wartzman has performed a great service in pulling together The Drucker Lectures. The collection is as far-ranging as Drucker's thinking and writing. If you have sampled Drucker before, you will find things you haven't seen. Peter's ideas live on. You will be energized by reading them anew.\"-Paul O'Neill, former U.S. Secretary of the Treasury\n\n\"Peter Drucker inspires awe. From the 1940s until his death a few years ago, he displayed a combination of insight, prescience, and productivity that few will ever match. This superbly edited collection captures both the range of Drucker's thinking and the sweep of history that informed it. The Drucker Lectures is a riveting read that reveals the depth and subtlety of one of America's most remarkable minds.\"-Daniel H.

Reading this book, I practically felt as though I were seated in the audience, listening to my friend and hero, Peter Drucker-truly one of the great geniuses of management.

These speeches contained some of his most valuable insights, but had never been published in book form—until now.\n\nThe Drucker Lectures features more than 30 talks from one of management's most important figures. Drawn from the Drucker Archives at the Drucker Institute at Claremont Graduate University, the lectures showcase Drucker's wisdom, wit, profundity, and prescience on such topics as:\n\nPolitics and economics of the environment\nKnowledge workers and the Knowledge Society\nComputer and information literacy\nManaging nonprofit organizations\nGlobalization\n\nDuring his life, Drucker well understood that over the last 150 years the world had become a society of large institutions—and that they would only become larger and more powerful. He contended that unless these institutions were effectively managed and ethically led, the good health of society as a whole would be in peril. His prediction is unfolding before our eyes.\n\nThe Drucker Lectures is a timely, instructive book proving that responsible behavior and good business can, in fact, exist hand in hand.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Development"]},{"id":"9781118240779","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Starting a Tech Business: A Practical Guide for Anyone Creating or Designing Applications or Software","authors":["Alex Cowan"],"pages":"258","publication_date":"April 2012","description":"The non-technical guide to building a booming tech-enabled business\n\nThinking of starting a technology-enabled business?

The author starts with a lucid introduction to the fundamentals of arbitrage, including the Laws of One Price and One Expected Return. Using realistic examples, he shows how to identify assets and portfolios ripe for exploitation: mispriced commodities, securities, misvalued currencies; interest rate differences; and more. You'll learn how to establish relative prices between underlying stock, puts, calls, and 'riskless' securities like Treasury bills -- and how these techniques support derivatives pricing and hedging. Billingsley then illuminates options pricing, the heart of modern risk management and financial engineering.

He was a pioneer in capital markets research in accounting, and his 1968 article, co-authored with Ray Ball, \"An Empirical Evaluation of Accounting Income Numbers,\" arguably had a greater impact on the course of accounting research, directly and indirectly, than any other article during the second half of the twentieth century. Since that time, his innovative research has focused on issues that bridge accounting and finance, including the relationships between net profit reports and the stock market, the long-run performance of acquiring firms, statutory sanctions and voluntary corporate disclosure, and the politics and future of national accounting standards to name a few.\n\nThis volume brings together the greatest hits of Brown’s career, including several articles that were published in out-of-the-way places, for easier use by students and researchers in the field. With a foreword written by Stephen A. Zeff, and an introduction that discusses the evolution of Brown’s research interests and explains the context for each of the essays included in the volume, this book offers the reader a unique look inside this remarkable 50-year career.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Accounting"]},{"id":"9780321648747","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Content Strategy for the Web","authors":["Kristina Halvorson"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"August 2009","description":"If your website content is out of date, off-brand, and out of control, you're missing a huge opportunity to engage, convert, and retain customers online.

Too many of us focus on how we're presenting, and don't spend enough time thinking about what we're presenting.

Piper, CFE provides insight and guidance on how to conduct thorough and complete investigations while juggling a caseload. Piper served over 30 years in law enforcement-including 20 as an award-winning Federal Special Agent-Criminal Investigator. His wide array of experience allows him to lend a high-level perspective to the art and science of professional investigations of criminal, civil, and administrative cases. In the book, Piper provides guidance on conducting thorough and complete investigations (even with fewer resources) and spotting red flags that often indicate big-picture problems. Piper also shows how to:\n\nIdentify the suspect's other wrongful acts (similar and otherwise)\n\nIdentify similar wrongful acts committed by others, and predict future occurrences\n\nIdentify systemic weaknesses, waste, and abuse\n\nIdentify changes and corrections necessary to prevent future occurrences\n\nThe book includes Piper's real-life investigative examples to illustrate important concepts. Whether the matter is public, private, or military, the same basic investigative principles apply. Things that may seem totally unrelated may hold the keys that crack the cases. The Investigator and Fraud Fighter Guidebook: Operation War Stories provides the acumen and judgment required to pick up on these clues and successfully conclude investigations.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Fraud Prevention"]},{"id":"9781838643898","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Salesforce Advanced Administrator Certification Guide","authors":["Enrico Murru"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"November 2019","description":"Dive into advanced Salesforce administration with the \"Salesforce Advanced Administrator Certification Guide.\" This comprehensive resource is designed to prepare you for the Salesforce Advanced Administrator certification exam by teaching advanced skills like automation, security, and data management.

Reilly"],"pages":"384","publication_date":"April 2020","description":"This revised second edition presents 15 years of data on Virtual Distance metrics and their predictive impact on organizational success factors shedding new light on how to correct for communication challenges that often show up as a foggy set of digital disconnects where the vitality of the virtual workforce often gets lost in transmission.\n\nThis still-evolving Digital Age conundrum continues to present new complications. The rise of remote work which rests on an increasing reliance on electronic communication and the overall growth of virtual interactions has led to the escalation of a phenomenon called Virtual Distance. Virtual Distance, which influences our behavior through three components Physical Distance, Operational Distance, and Affinity Distance affects not only how we relate to others thousands of miles away but even to co-workers sitting right next to each other!  Perhaps even more problematic, Virtual Distance causes measureable malfunctions in teamwork, innovation, leader effectiveness and overall performance. \n\nBut it doesn’t have to be this way.\n\nThePower of Virtual Distance offers specific, proven and predictable solutions that can reverse these trends and turn Virtual Distance into a unification strategy to capture untapped competitive advantage.\n\nSurprised? \n\nThe Power of Virtual Distance, 2nd Edition is a must-read for leadership who want to understand the true and quantifiable costs of the virtual workplace.  For the first time ever, readers can take the guesswork out of managing the virtual workforce by applying a mathematical approach derived from the extensive Virtual Distance data set:  The Virtual Distance Ratio.   The Virtual Distance Ratio can precisely pinpoint the particular impacts of Virtual Distance on the organization’s critical success factors.  Beyond business metrics, Virtual Distance solutions also detail ways to restore meaningfulness and well-being into people’s experience of work, enhancing life lived in the Digital Age. The Power of Virtual Distance reveals an updated set of data, including the first award-winning analysis, collected from an extended range of executives to individual contributors, that represent situations and solutions in more than 36 industries in 55 countries across the globe. Readers will get a “first look” at the data and its revelations on how to be less isolated and more integrated.\n\nHelping managers globally, this book: \n\nOffers new, real-world case studies and a chance for readers to participate in thought experiments to help with personal performance, group synergy and by extension, relationship dynamics of all kinds\nDemonstrates (with statistically significant trend analyses) that Virtual Distance is growing at exponential rates in every corner of communities worldwide\nOffers expert advice on how to manage the “unintended human consequences” of today’s digital technologies\n\nCompanies that successfully harness the power of Virtual Distance demonstrate better performance. The second edition of The Power of Virtual Distance is a valuable, one-of-a-kind resource for everyone – from the C-suite to human resource professionals; from divisional leaders to project managers.  Everyone in the organization can benefit by discovering how to improve financials, innovation, trust, employee engagement, satisfaction, organizational citizenship and other key performance indicators.  And perhaps best of all, by following the prescriptions on how to reduce Virtual Distance, the entire workforce will have the tools they need to bring about a revival of meaning, purpose and an enlivened sense of “humanhood” back into everyday work and everyday life.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Digital Transformation"]},{"id":"9780071783866","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Patents and Strategic Inventing: The Corporate Inventor's Guide to Creating Sustainable Competitive Advantage","authors":["Nicholas Nissing"],"pages":"256","publication_date":"September 2012","description":"A true original—the first practical guide to patents written specifically for corporate scientists, engineers, and product developers\n\nPatents and Strategic Inventing spells out exactly what a typical corporate inventor needs to know about patents and patent strategy, as well as how these topics can be used to guide the creation of new products.

You don’t have to if you follow the path Karen lays out.\n\nThis no-nonsense book helps you get to the crux of the problem, so you can inject the sensible, disciplined calm that enables the levels of performance and innovation mandated by today's business environment--and help your organization become truly outstanding.\n\nPraise for The Outstanding Organization\n\n\"Too often, outstanding performance seems out of reach.

We’re now living in that future, and one of the seminal books of the Internet Age is more relevant than ever.\n\nThe future was a place where technology was supposed to empower individuals and obliterate social organizations. Pundits predicted that information technology would spell the end of almost everything—from mass media to bureaucracies, universities, politics, and governments. Clearly, we are not living in that future. The Social Life of Information explains why.\n\nJohn Seely Brown and Paul Duguid show us how to look beyond mere information to the social context that creates and gives meaning to it. Arguing elegantly for the important role that human sociability plays, even—perhaps especially—in the digital world, The Social Life of Information gives us an optimistic look beyond the simplicities of information and individuals. It shows how a better understanding of the contribution that communities, organizations, and institutions make to learning, working, and innovating can lead to the richest possible use of technology in our work and everyday lives.\n\nWith a new introduction by David Weinberger and reflections by the authors on developments since the book’s first publication, this new edition is essential reading for anyone seeking to understand the human place in a digital world.","tags":["Business","Technology in Business"]},{"id":"9781604911220","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Developing Political Savvy","authors":["William Gentry","Jean Brittain Leslie"],"pages":"26","publication_date":"April 2012","description":"There are many things that politics is not.

He challenges us to understand how we know what we think we know in order to better discover faulty assumptions that often are camouflaged by language. His knowledge building loop offers guideposts to design experiments and organize feedback to facilitate early adaptation to a changed environment and to avoid being mired in ways of thinking rooted in 'knowledge' of what worked well in the past—a context far different from the context of today. His book explains a way of being that enables those who work for, or invest in, business firms to see beyond accounting silos and short-term quarterly earnings and to focus on capabilities instrumental for creating long-term future and sustainable value for the firm's stakeholders. I can't recommend this astounding book enough especially given its deep and timely insights for our world today.\" —John Seely Brown, former Chief Scientist for Xerox Corp and Director of its Palo Alto Research Center (PARC); co-author with Ann Pendleton-Jullian of Design Unbound: Designing for Emergence in a White Water World\n\n\"In contrast to existing abstract theories of the firm, Madden's pragmatic theory of the firm connects management's decisions in a practical way to a firm's life cycle and market valuation. The book promotes a firm's knowledge building proficiency, relative to competitors, as the fundamental driver of a firm's long-term performance, which leads to insights about organizational capabilities, intangible assets, and excess shareholder returns. Value Creation Principles is ideally suited to facilitate progress in the New Economy by opening up the process by which firms build knowledge and create value, which is a needed step in revising how neoclassical economics treats the firm.\" —Tyler Cowen, Professor of Economics, George Mason University; co-author of the popular economics blog Marginal Revolution\n\n\"Bartley Madden rightfully points out that both textbook and more advanced economic theories of the firm fail to address the concerns of top management and boards of directors. He offers a tantalizing pragmatic alternative that directly connects to quantitative changes in the firm's market value. His framework gives recognition to the importance of intangible assets, and his pragmatic approach is quite complementary to the Dynamic Capabilities framework that strategic managers implicitly and sometimes explicitly employ.\" —David J.

The rapid pace of change demands fast and flexible responses throughout the organization-there's no time to wait for directives from the top. And the highly-skilled workers so vital to organizational success also demand a high degree of independence. Old-fashioned command-and-control leadership is just too slow and stifling.Charles Manz and Henry Sims, Jr. pioneered the concept self-leadership in their bestselling book SuperLeadership. In The New SuperLeadership, the authors present new content and examples designed to help leaders develop the kind of autonomous, quick-reacting workforce necessary to thrive in these turbulent times. This enriched and expanded edition takes the concepts in the first edition to another level by emphasizing a pragmatic, how-to approach for developing leaders at every level of the organization.Drawing on contemporary examples and profiles, many from the high-tech and information sectors, Manz and Sims shatter the myth of the traditional, aggrandized versions of \"heroic\" leadership. They show that a leader truly becomes successful by turning followers into extraordinary self-leaders-pillars of strength that will support the organization at every level. They detail a series of action-oriented steps through which the SuperLeader provides an opportunity for followers to express and develop their own leadership skills-and in the process become highly motivated, dynamic contributors.The New SuperLeadership critically reviews traditional leadership styles, vividly illustrating the drawbacks of each: the \"Strong Man\" whose reliance on fear-based compliance smothers initiative; the \"Transactor\" who promotes a narrow \"what's in it for me?\" mentality; and the \"Visionary Hero\" whose powerful personality inspires commitment but inadvertently discourages independent thinking. By bringing out the leader in every employee, SuperLeadership enables leaders to avoid these pitfalls and develop an enthusiastic, innovative and energized workforce.The New SuperLeadership is a radically new way of looking at leadership, offering a leadership paradigm ideally suited to the realities of the modern workplace. It reveals that the only way to succeed today is to tap into the innate leadership potential that lies within every employee.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9780134463667","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Customer Service: How to Attract, Retain, and Interact with High-Quality Customers","authors":["Jeff Havens"],"pages":"100","publication_date":"December 2015","description":"Includes Complete Participant & Instructor Workbooks!\n\nOverview\n\nYour fast, fun resource for delivering outstanding customer service: the perfect complement to Jeff Havens’s Customer Service video course!\n\nDescription\n\nIn an era where many companies offer similar products and services at similar prices, it’s hard to stand out.

Two people can have identical experiences, but one blossoms while the other is depleted. The same can be said for any pair of fired CEOs, unsuccessful political candidates, or rookie supervisors. In Crucibles of Leadership, Robert J. Thomas concludes that what matters most is what one makes of experience, particularly the traumatic and often unplanned crucible events that challenge one's identity as a leader. What distinguishes leaders who grow through a crucible experience? Their approach to learning. Like accomplished athletes or artists, they practice as strenuously as they perform. And because the line between performance and practice is often hard to discern, they learn how to practice while they perform.But theirs is no ordinary practice. It's a regimen tailored to individual aspirations, motivations, and learning styles--a Personal Learning Strategy. Building on insightful and moving stories told by accomplished leaders, Thomas offers probing self-assessments and innovative tools designed to help you develop your own Personal Learning Strategy.Provocative and original, with examples drawn from business and politics as well as from the inner workings of the Mormon Church and the Hell's Angels, Thomas's book will revolutionize the way you think about leadership and learning.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781422163795","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Understanding Finance","authors":["Harvard Business Review"],"pages":"94","publication_date":"August 2007","description":"Explains the essential concepts of financebudgeting, forecasting, and planningto managers who are not financial managers.

That, combined with the speed of the Internet, changes the game for many companies in anticipating, managing, and ultimately avoiding an “instant crisis”—an instant crisis example is when Verizon added a $2 charge for all their customers; one hour later 100,000 signatures appeared on a Twitter petition, and soon Verizon was in the middle of a huge public relations crisis. Inside this book, you’ll learn just how to manage this type of situation and meet the challenges of social media. Each chapter includes a description of a crisis, the timeliness of a good response, the effectiveness of this response, and an assessment of what works and what doesn’t.

You’ll learn how companies are linking strategy, the value chain, and IT—and how they are executing on their plans to achieve real competitive advantage.

This book is full of intriguing, fresh insights which will expand your perspective on what is possible in maximizing revenue from your company’s products and services.”—Mark Greatrex, Chief Marketing Officer, Cox Communications, and former SVP, Global Still Beverages, The Coca Cola Company\n\n“To effectively price, managers must understand market context—the frame of reference for buyers. Context is far more important than the usual measures of price variation. I strongly recommend this readable and useful book to any business leader who suspects his or her company is falling short of achievable revenues.”—Dave Calhoun, Chairman and CEO, Nielsen Company, and former Vice Chairman, General Electric Company\n\nAbout the Book:\n\nA few leading companies have jettisoned ideas about pricing that other companies believe are indispensible. The result has been superior performance against competitors who persist in a simplistic 1990s belief in “value.”\n\nContextual Pricing describes how buyers are influenced by comparison points and contextual messages more than by actual price levels. Identical products can sell at radically different prices to the same target customer—if context is strategically managed. This fact is how Procter & Gamble, GE, Coca-Cola Company, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and others make sure they get the best possible price. The use of context is changing the way companies price and sell in the new global economy.\n\nThis readable and market-tested book describes the contextual pricing perspective, how it is being used in B2B and B2C markets, and how you can make the shift to contextual pricing in your own business. Whether you’re a CEO, P&L manager marketing director, sales manager, or entrepreneur, Contextual Pricing shows you how to:\n\nUnderstand how your customer will make buying decisions and the role of pricing in those decisions\nEstablish better, more intuitive prices using context\nDevelop contextual pricing strategies that defeat competitor pricing—how contextual pricing can be the antidote to destructive price wars\nHarmonize your pricing with branding, product development and channel strategies\nIncrease your profits with proven pricing tools, such as scientific bundling, tiering, branding, upsell “hooks” and more\n\nThrough its illuminating case-by-case studies, Contextual Pricing delivers a wide range of pricing techniques and customer insights that you won’t find anywhere else. You’ll learn how to avoid common pitfalls when raising or lowering prices and discover how you can compete in traditional or emerging digital marketplaces—and beat the competition through superior tactics, not through lower margins.\n\nWhen you know the secrets of Contextual Pricing, you can name your price, drive your sales, increase your profits, and own your success.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Market Segmentation & Pricing"]},{"id":"9780071787130","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Bring Out the Best in Every Employee: How to Engage Your Whole Team by Making Every Leadership Moment Count","authors":["Don Brown","Bill Hawkins"],"pages":"208","publication_date":"November 2012","description":"Elevate Capacity AND Drive Growth Now--Without Adding Headcount Management\n\n\"As leaders, we like to think we control everything, and it's just not true--externals now drive the business.

It shapes our identities, affects our relationships, and defines our communities. It also influences our consumption habits, represents our cultures, and dramatizes our politics. In other words, sport is among the most prominent vehicles for communication available in daily life. Nevertheless, only recently has it begun to receive robust attention in the discipline of communication studies. The handbook of Communication and Sport attends to the recent and rapid growth of scholarship in communication and media studies that features sport as a central site of inquiry. The book attempts to capture a full range of methods, theories, and topics that have come to define the subfield of \"communication and sport\" or \"sports communication.\" It does so by emphasizing four primary features. First, it foregrounds \"communication\" as central to the study of sport. This emphasis helps to distinguish the book from collections in related disciplines such as sociology, and also points readers beyond media as the primary or only context for understanding the relationship between communication and sport. Thus, in addition to studies of media effects, mediatization, media framing, and more, readers will also engage with studies in interpersonal, intercultural, organizational, and rhetorical communication. Second, the handbook presents an array of methods, theories, and topics in the effort to chart a comprehensive landscape of communication and sport scholarship. Thus, readers will benefit from empirical, interpretive, and critical work, and they will also see studies drawing on varied texts and sites of inquiry. Third, the handbook of Communication and Sport includes a broad range of scholars from around the world. It is therefore neither European nor North American in its primary focus. In addition, the book includes contributors from commonly under-represented regions in Asia, Africa, and South America. Fourth, the handbook aims to account for both historical trajectories and contemporary areas of interest. In this way, it covers the central topics, debates, and perspectives from the past and also suggests continued and emerging pathways for the future. Collectively, the handbook of Communication and Sport aspires to provide scholars and students in communication and media studies with the most comprehensive assessment of the field available.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Communication"]},{"id":"9781292009292","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"The FT Guide to the Gurus: Strategy - The Top 20 Strategic Thinkers and What They Can Do For You","authors":["Vaughan Evans"],"pages":"1","publication_date":"February 2014","description":"Clayton Christensen, Jim Collins, Malcolm Gladwell, Michael Porter, Kim and Mauborgne, Richard Rumelt...

In response, many countries have replaced pre-existing domestic standards with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) in an attempt to ensure that auditors throughout the world apply the same level of standards during all audit assignments, and that audit quality remains consistent on a global basis.\n\nInternational Standards on Auditing are frequently updated to improve and clarify their application throughout the audit and accounting profession. They can be extremely complex and difficult to apply in real life situations. It is essential to apply the standards with sufficient rigor to enable an efficient audit to take place, to satisfy the regulators and ensure that the client receives and audit which is beneficial, cost effective, and which conforms to the prescribed framework; however, auditors are often criticised for failing to do so.\n\nRecognising that auditing is not always an exact science, and that in many cases the auditor is called upon to make a judgement in situations open to differing opinions, this book takes a practical and pragmatic approach to following International Standards on Auditing. Steve Collings looks at the full ISAs in their final form, as reissued following the IAASB 'Clarity Project', and give auditors guidance on how to interpret and apply them in real life situations. Each redrafted or rewritten ISA is dealt with in a separate chapter, containing case studies and illustrative examples. The book also covers the regulatory framework of auditing and gives a summary of the five ethical standards applicable to auditors, as mapped by the IAASB. Detailed appendices provide an overview of IFRS and IAS, illustrative audit tests and illustrative financial statements.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Auditing & Financial GRC"]},{"id":"9781786308122","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Organizational Creative Capabilities","authors":["Guy Parmentier"],"pages":"256","publication_date":"May 2024","description":"Creativity, whether individual or collective, is often approached without taking into account organizational processes, routines and management systems.

This development, which started in the 1940s, has become even more pronounced with the proliferation of computers and the invasion of digital technology in all wakes of working life. It may appear that the importance of human work has been reduced compared to what can be achieved by intelligent software systems, but in reality, the opposite is true: the more complex a system, the more vital the human operator's task. The conditions have changed, however, whereas people used to be in control of their own tasks, today they have become supervisors of tasks which are shared between humans and machines. A considerable effort has been devoted to the domain of administrative and clerical work and has led to the establishment of an internationally based human-computer interaction (HCI) community at research and application levels. The HCI community, however, has paid more attention to static environments where the human operator is in complete control of the situation, rather than to dynamic environments where changes may occur independent of human intervention and actions. This book's basic philosophy is the conviction that human operators remain the unchallenged experts even in the worst cases where their working conditions have been impoverished by senseless automation. They maintain this advantage due to their ability to learn and build up a high level of expertise -- a foundation of operational knowledge -- during their work. This expertise must be taken into account in the development of efficient human-machine systems, in the specification of training requirements, and in the identification of needs for specific computer support to human actions. Supporting this philosophy, this volume *deals with the main features of cognition in dynamic environments, combining issues coming from empirical approaches of human cognition and cognitive simulation, *addresses the question of the development of competence and expertise, and *proposes ways to take up the main challenge in this domain -- the design of an actual cooperation between human experts and computers of the next century.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Innovation"]},{"id":"9781119971924","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The New Economics of Sovereign Wealth Funds","authors":["Massimiliano Castelli","Fabio Scacciavillani"],"pages":"228","publication_date":"May 2012","description":"A complete guide to sovereign wealth funds written by and for industry practitioners\n\nSovereign wealth funds (SWFs) aren't new, but they are often misunderstood.

This is often why diversity efforts falter—people believe in diversity until they feel that they have to give something up.

Tim Johnson, Obama and Romney all kept dog-eared copies of Kevin Mellyn's Broken Markets on their nightstands. . . . Mellyn's work is a fascinating, important, and eminently good read and should inform the debate on overhauling the U.S. and global financial regulatory systems and sustainable macro fiscal and monetary policy.\"\n\n--Eric Grover, in his review of Broken Markets in The American Banker\n\nBroken Markets allows the intelligent non-specialist to understand and navigate the ongoing worldwide aftermath of the 2008 financial market meltdown. The key theme of the book is how the leading financial institutions and the political leadership of the U.S. and European Union have failed us and set the stage for continued market turmoil. It explains what this means for investors, borrowers, society in general, and the financial-services industry. Former banker Kevin Mellyn focuses on providing readers with clear and simple explanations of the forces at work and the potential consequences for their future prosperity.\n\nAs this book makes clear, what's coming is a world in which high structural unemployment and flat or declining real income is likely—not to mention a diminished retirement financial safety net. The book therefore provides actionable information for protecting wealth and making prudent investment decisions in an economy that is nothing like the one that has sustained us for decades.\n\nAs a forward-looking narrative about rapidly changing events and volatile markets and politics, Broken Markets will provide no single prediction about the future but rather describe alternative scenarios and provide the reader with signposts to watch out for in deciding which reality is actually unfolding. Unlike most books written by journalists on global finance, the scenarios and signposts described will be largely based on the lessons of financial and political history rather than breaking news. This book:\n\nTells you in plain language how today's financial system threatens your livelihood and wealth\n\nTells you why and how governments worldwide, with some notable exceptions, are taking actions likely to make things worse instead of better\n\nExplains how the leading financial institutions lost their way during the bubble years and how they can find the path back to prosperity and value to society\n\nTells you what life will be like in a \"post-finance\" economy and how you can protect your wealth\n\nWhat you'll learn\n\nAfter reading Broken Markets, you will:\n\nUnderstand how governments and financial leaders made poor decisions and the consequences in both the short and long term\n\n\"Connect the dots\" between seemingly unconnected market developments\n\nUnderstand how global finance really influences your livelihood\n\nEvaluate professional investment advice critically\n\nMake an independent, informed evaluation of competing economic and political policies\n\nDevelop a long-term financial game plan for a \"post-finance\" world\n\nImpress your friends and family with your financial savvy\n\nWho this book is for\n\nBroken Markets is for people who have savings and investments, watch the business news, read the Wall Street Journal or Financial Times at least occasionally, and just want to make sense of the post-2008 crisis world while taking steps to protect their hard-won wealth. It is not intended for financial professionals, though it will strike a chord there. Mostly it is for the sensible, educated man and woman looking for straight talk and clarity. It is also a good choice for students and young people just starting their careers since it teaches them things their teachers (and often their employers) never told them. Above all, it is a good choice for anyone who likes to be informed, provoked into re-examining beliefs and assumptions, and entertained by sharp-edged writing.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance"]},{"id":"9780137008629","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"A Manager’s Guide to Project Management: Learn How to Apply Best Practices","authors":["Michael B.

Your ability to be resilient—to pick yourself up after setbacks and keep on going no matter the challenges—is critical not only to successful leadership but also to fostering teams, generating collaboration, and igniting your organization. In this breakthrough book, veteran consultants Joan McArthur-Blair and Jeanie Cockell show that Appreciative Inquiry can be an invaluable tool to build that resilience.Appreciative Inquiry is a time-tested, highly effective, and widely used change method that emphasizes identifying what's working well in a system and building on those strengths. Originating in the 1980s, it's been responsible for dramatic results in every conceivable type of organization. Using the authors' Appreciative Resilience model, leaders can use AI to increase their ability to weather the storms they'll inevitably face and come out stronger. A profoundly practical guide, this book features first-person accounts from leaders in all kinds of settings and situations describing how they've used AI concepts to increase their resilience, as well as a detailed description of the exercises and practices the authors use in their Appreciative Resilience Workshop. McArthur-Blair and Cockell believe that the core of resilience is the interplay among despair, hope, and forgiveness. Every leader experiences despair in those moments when there is no clear path forward. Maintaining hope that a better future is possible enables leaders to keep going. And forgiveness, of one's own shortcomings and those of others, helps leaders move from despair to hope. AI's focus on the best of what is and using that to generate the future makes it a particularly powerful aid and ally on this journey.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781786306371","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Cultural Commons in the Digital Ecosystem","authors":["Maud Pelissier"],"pages":"240","publication_date":"July 2021","description":"INTELLECTUAL TECHNOLOGIES SET Coordinated by Jean-Max Noyer and Maryse CarmesThe dynamics of production, circulation and dissemination of knowledge that are currently developing in the digital ecosystem testify to a profound change in capitalism.

This idea will resonate only too well with those who have endeavoured to be creative by thinking outside that box, only to have their attempts scuppered by the constraints of bureaucracy and organizational politics. Instead of fighting a losing battle, the author suggests that creativity should be worked at within the constraints of the organizational box, but that space needs to be grown and allowed to be shaken up. Only by experimenting, mutating and finding new directions can you uncover business paths that lead to success. The reader is encouraged not to free themselves from all their knowledge and experiences (the thinking outside the box method) but to use their knowledge and experience in new ways.\n\nThe book is structured around three key steps:\n\nExpanding the box: so that the pieces of the puzzle in it can move around more freely\n\nFilling the box: with even more knowledge, and how to get these new pieces of the puzzle to connect with the existing ones\n\nShaking the box: so that the pieces fall into new places and form new patterns.\n\nThe book shows that anybody can be creative.\n\nThe creative methods suggested in the book will be linked to real business examples from which techniques have been developed to help their implementation. Numerous exercises and 'eye-openers' form part of the practical implementation of Micael Dahlén's ideas. The book is framed by models and concepts of how creativity works (the creative process, the creative person and the creative result) and what its effects are.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Innovation"]},{"id":"9781292088112","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"The, Rules of Work, 4th Edition","authors":["Richard Templar"],"pages":"295","publication_date":"October 2015","description":"For some people, work is a breeze.

Make sure you do it right.\n\nProfessional service firms face a serious challenge. Their clients increasingly need them to solve complex problems—everything from regulatory compliance to cybersecurity, the kinds of problems that only teams of multidisciplinary experts can tackle.\n\nYet most firms have carved up their highly specialized, professional experts into narrowly defined practice areas, and collaborating across these silos is often messy, risky, and expensive. Unless you know why you’re collaborating and how to do it effectively, it may not be smart at all. That’s especially true for partners who have built their reputations and client rosters independently, not by working with peers.\n\nIn Smart Collaboration, Heidi K. Gardner shows that firms earn higher margins, inspire greater client loyalty, attract and retain the best talent, and gain a competitive edge when specialists collaborate across functional boundaries. Gardner, a former McKinsey consultant and Harvard Business School professor now lecturing at Harvard Law School, has spent over a decade conducting in-depth studies of numerous global professional service firms. Her research with clients and the empirical results of her studies demonstrate clearly and convincingly that collaboration pays, for both professionals and their firms.\n\nBut Gardner also offers powerful prescriptions for how leaders can foster collaboration, move to higher-margin work, increase client satisfaction, improve lateral hiring, decrease enterprise risk, engage workers to contribute their utmost, break down silos, and boost their bottom line.\n\nWith case studies and real-world insights, Smart Collaboration delivers an authoritative case for the value of collaboration to today’s professionals, their firms, and their clients and shows you exactly how to achieve it.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Communication","Collaboration"]},{"id":"9781838987732","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Deploying Microsoft 365 Teamwork: Exam MS-300 Guide","authors":["Aaron Guilmette"],"pages":"632","publication_date":"January 2020","description":"Master the essential skills and knowledge to pass the Microsoft MS-300 exam with this comprehensive guide.

As an update to Evans's earlier book Social Media Marketing, the new Social Customer Experience connects the early cases presented in 2010 with significant, contemporary examples, key concepts, and best practices associated with the adoption of social technology by global brands. This latest edition offers a blueprint for transforming your organization's disparate social initiatives into a unified social experience strategy. Most people know that social technologies are transforming business, but few understand how those changes are happening across the organization. Whether in marketing, communications, customer care, digital media or product development these changes shape the way in which business manage the experience their customers have with the brand. Filled with practical examples of what to do, and illustrated with cases taken from real companies, Social Customer Experience fills in the gaps for companies who want to do more with social than just listen and experiment.\n\nPart I lays the groundwork by explaining the three waves of change that combine to form social customer experience: social technologies and their impact on Web 1.0 digital infrastructures; social customers and their impact on marketing and support operations; and the new discipline of customer experience management that is reframing the old sales-and-service-centric ways of thinking about how companies relate to customers. Part I concludes by defining the social customer experience ecosystem, both on and off your own web domain.\n\nPart II, \"Your Social Presence,\" puts you on the ground, with tactics and examples for how to apply social technologies and achieve your business objectives, how to measure and analyze social data and show business value, and how to implement a best-practice approach to avoid common traps and pursue proven opportunities.\n\nPart III digs deeper into the five building blocks of social customer experience: organization, platform, content, people and tools. What's a social experience organization look like? What systems need to be in place? How do you get the most out of the social \"objects\" - content and other assets - that are the byproduct of great social customer experiences? How do connections between customers - the social graph - come into play? And what applications will you use - literally, what will you empower your customers to do? Part III answers these questions in the practical, method-driven style of authors Dave Evans and Joe Cothrel.\n\nSocial Customer Experience features detailed exercises that show you how to translate learning into action, hands-on tutorials using today's social media tools and platforms, and compelling, modern case studies from organizations of all sizes—from the Fortune 500 to nonprofits and mom-n-pop main-street shops. As a bonus, the book also features resources and references to connect readers with the current thought leaders and sources of timely information.\n\nIf you're interested in business, and how business is being reshaped by social technology, Social Customer Experience will show you a path to a new relationship with your customers, customers not only buy your products and services but get more out of them and go on to become partners in your business-selling, supporting, and innovating on your behalf.","tags":["Business","Project & Product Management","Product Management","Customer Experience"]},{"id":"9781260475081","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Building a Millionaire Mindset: How to Use the Pillars of Entrepreneurship to Gain, Maintain, and Sustain Long-Lasting Wealth","authors":["Johnny Wimbrey"],"pages":"272","publication_date":"December 2020","description":"Become a first-generation millionaire using the groundbreaking mindset of entrepreneurial phenom Johnny WimbreyFrom teenage felon to multi-millionaire in a just few short years after implementing his millionaire mindset principles . .The meteoric rise of Johnny Wimbrey is one of the great rags-to-riches / tragedy to triumph tales of our time.

Alan Briskin shows how the modern organization has gradually increased its demands on us-beginning with our bodies, then our minds, and now our souls. But through the moving personal stories of people fighting to reclaim their souls, he also sends a message that encourages individuals to keep their spiritual integrity and values alive.In The Stirring of Soul In the Workplace, Briskin weaves together lessons from history, psychology, and management theory, with numerous real-life examples, to tell the story of how the modern workplace has evolved to value technology and productivity over soulfulness and relationship. From the Industrial Revolution's marriage of mechanization and efficiency to the management theories of the early 20th century, Briskin traces the emergence of the quest for efficiency and control in the workplace. He questions the corporate concept of \"individual personality\" that asks us to check our emotions, fantasies, imaginations, and souls at the door. He describes the history of the soul as a dynamic force that continues to influence our behavior, and shows how excluding it from our work life actually flattens our potential and dampens our creativity.Rather than solve the conventional question organizations have been asking for years-how can we change people?-Alan Briskin examines how organizations can better reflect personal and human values in the workplace. For organizations that too often have sacrificed the well-being of the individual for the goals of the organization, the author suggests a more active way of taking up our work roles that can bring more of our experience and imagination into play. He points out that meaning cannot come from corporate mission statements or reengineering programs. Instead, it needs to be nurtured through dialogue and reflection, the courage to ask troubling questions, and a willingness to face the consequences of our collective and individual actions. When we learn to honor the contradictions, uncertainties, and interconnections inherent in the workplace, the energies of the soul will begin to stir with revitalizing results.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Culture in Business"]},{"id":"9781605093949","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"The Answer to How Is Yes","authors":["Peter Block"],"pages":"216","publication_date":"November 2003","description":"Modern culture’s worship of “how-to” pragmatism has turned us into instruments of efficiency and commerce—but we’re doing more and more about things that mean less and less. We constantly ask “how? and still struggle to find purpose and act on what matters. Instead of acting on what we know to be of importance, we wait for bosses to change, we seek the latest fad, we invest in one more degree. Asking how keeps us safe—instead of being led by our hearts into uncharted territory, we keep our heads down and stick to the rules. But we are gaining the world and losing our souls.\n\nPeter Block puts the “how-to” craze in perspective and presents a guide to the difficult and life-granting journey of bringing what we know is of personal value into an indifferent or even hostile corporate and cultural landscape. He raises our awareness of the trade-offs we’ve made in the name of practicality and expediency, and offers hope for a way of life in which we’re motivated not by what “works,” but by the things that truly matter in life—idealism, intimacy, depth and engagement.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Culture in Business"]},{"id":"9783110763188","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Compassionate Leadership","authors":["Kirstie Drummond Papworth"],"pages":"222","publication_date":"July 2023","description":"Shortlisted in the Leadership category at the Business Book Awards in partnership with Pathway Group 2024\n\nLonglisted for the CMI Management Publication of the Year 2024\n\nFinalist in the Leadership - Think Differently category of the Goody Business Book Awards 2023\n\nExperts increasingly recognise that our volatile, complex, and fragile world requires a new type of leadership. More than ever, we need leaders who understand how compassion connects them with their employees, stakeholders and wider communities. Yet compassion in organisations is often misunderstood, with many leaders reluctant to embrace it lest they appear weak.\n\nCompassionate Leadership draws on new and established research in psychology, behavioural science, neuropsychology and leadership theory to show that compassion, when correctly understood and applied is, in fact, a formidable and sustainable force for positive leadership.\n\nThis book explores the common myths, pitfalls, and concerns about leading with a compassionate approach. It discusses the leadership, organisational and individual benefits of compassion and shows how leaders can design an organisation which establishes, then reinforces, a compassionate culture.\n\nA practical guide, this book provides evidence-based tools, appraisals, and frameworks which emphasise everyday applications that leaders, managers, and business students can adopt both individually and for their organisations.\n\nCompassionate Leadership presents a new model of compassion, an approach based on multidisciplinary research in a variety of organisational settings.

The traditional advice is to train quickly on products, grab a customer list, start calling for appointments, discover opportunities, and close deals. In fact, almost every sales model out there is based on nothing more than \"opportunity\" management. But jumping straight to opportunity will leave salespeople chasing their tails and coming up short on payday.\n\nWith an emphasis on basic sales skills that have been refreshed for today's generation of buyers, Trust-Based Selling shows there is a significant problem you must overcome when opening up new accounts and territories. No matter what you are selling, your prospect already has a trusted relationship with an incumbent vendor and will continue to buy from that vendor even when you have the better solution. The playing field is not level—and you’re on the wrong side. So how can you compete to win?\n\n\"Trust is the grease that makes business sales effortless,\" writes sales pro and trainer Dave Monty in this quick-read book. Opportunity metrics are important, but trust—and a few sharp insider tactics Monty reveals—is the guidepost that leads to success.

But until now, the field of diversity had no established standard for evaluating best practices, or even agreement on fundamental philosophies, principles, and concepts. In this pioneering book, the world's leading diversity authority proposes a framework that will facilitate the development of a truly world-class standard for diversity management.R. Roosevelt Thomas begins by laying out his Four Quadrant model, which encompasses all core diversity strategies: managing workforce demographic representation, managing demographic relationships, managing diverse talent, and managing all strategic diversity mixtures. He analyzes the goals, motives, approaches, accomplishments, and challenges associated with each quadrant, as well as the paradigm or mindset that lies behind each quadrant's express purpose. Having laid out this broad range of strategies, Thomas shows how to realize them through the Strategic Diversity Management Process™, by far the most effective method for implementation. A detailed case study of CEO Jeff Kilt—a fictional composite of the many executives Thomas has worked with—effectively illustrates the complexities encountered when working with each of the Four Quadrant strategies in the real world. This book offers a comprehensive blueprint that will enable leaders to address any diversity issue (not just race or gender) in any setting, anywhere in the world.

Updated and expanded throughout, this Book reflects new research at Wharton and beyond, new cases and techniques, and extensive new input from managers solving execution-related problems. Hrebiniak addresses issues including organizational structure, incentives, controls, coordination, information sharing, change management, culture, power, influence, and project management. In an expanded applications section, he applies his model to a wide range of challenging, real-world situations. This edition presents deeper analysis of strategy execution in global environments, techniques for linking project management to strategy, and executing on strategy in service organizations.

He systematically identifies three brain barriers to change: failure to see, move, and finish. Then, he offers powerful tools, strategies, and solutions for overcoming all three.

Today, the demand for faster approaches is increasing across a broad spectrum of organizations in business and society, as they are faced daily with an array of change mandates-new business strategy development and deployment, merger and acquisition integration, work re-design, community organizing, and more. Traditional command and control structures and processes no longer enable and mobilize people in organizations-the rapid rate of change in the environment demands new and different ways for organizations to respond.Whole-Scale Change: Unleashing the Magic in Organizations combines systems theory and practical methodology to offer a proven, flexible approach that leads to aligned action by hundreds, even thousands of people-and creates powerful processes for change. Shattering the old paradigm about how long it takes organizations to change, the book shows how to rapidly engage the whole system in meeting organizational agility and flexibility demands. It offers adaptable, repeatable strategies for different settings and convening issues through the authors' unique Whole-Scale approach-which has been successfully applied in diverse businesses and industries, the service sector, health care, education, government, other nonprofits, and communities throughout the world.Imagine everyone in your organization pulling in the same direction, everyone with the same information, acting quickly to solve the problems and confront the issues facing your organization. Whole-Scale Change provides not only the theories and principles underlying the approach, but also the practical methods, tools, and road maps for unleashing the energy and combining the power and wisdom of all the people in an organization.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Business Architecture"]},{"id":"9781605093840","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"We Are All Self-Employed, 2nd Edition","authors":["Cliff Hakim"],"pages":"263","publication_date":"November 2003","description":"This is not a book about starting your own business. Then again, it is. By now there is ample evidence that an \"employed\" attitude-believing that you work for an employer and acting as though by doing your work your job will be secure-is defunct.

In this revised edition of his prescient bestseller, Cliff Hakim shows how to replace your employed attitude with a self-employed attitude.\"We are all self-employed\" is an empowering belief that you can steer your own direction and influence the quality of your life.

He takes you on a journey of assimilating and constructing this new, more empowered attitude toward work and life. Each chapter features checklists and exercises to deepen your understanding of what a self-employed attitude is and how you can cultivate and maintain it, as well as examples of the self-employed attitude in action.

As the nation spins its wheels--reeling from the job losses of the recession and seemingly unable to generate the breakthroughs needed to propel alternative energy, medicine, and other critical fields--Europe and especially Asia have begun to capture the leadership of crucial new technology sectors.How can America revitalize its innovation leadership and kick-start the economy again? In Great Again, veteran high-tech CEO Henry Nothhaft takes us inside the heart of America's innovation community to surface a new proposal for the job creation and economic growth we need. Bringing to life the human drama of the exhilarating, demanding and often frustrating startup environment, Nothhaft offers this complex world as the setting for a promising solution to the country's current standstill. Nothhaft, with journalist David Kline, says a breakthrough can be achieved through a series of practical and achievable tax, regulatory and other reforms that would help strengthen entrepreneurial startup businesses--and offer the necessary fuel for an American resurgence. They key is to bolster the segment and lessen the startup's struggle against a perfect storm of \"red tape\" burdens.

This, the only book to cover the last ten years of the OECD’s work, focuses on the policy-related advice, evidence-based global standards, trusted statistics and analysis, and support for policy reform that it has developed.\n\nThe book commences with a brief history of the OECD and its key decision processes and then examines the impact of its leadership in driving a wide range of achievements and in securing an expanding, increasingly global role. It focuses on the organisation’s green agenda and the move to measure living conditions in a more detailed fashion, rather than relying largely on GDP, and on the inclusive growth project that aims at making markets work for all. It discusses the OECD’s remarkably influential work in education, including PISA and PIAAC, and demonstrates the capacity of the OECD to embrace new areas of work – the importance of innovation and the digital economy in driving economic growth.\n\nBased on access to a wide range of documents and extensive interviews with senior officials and members, this comprehensive book also sheds light on the OECD’s partnership with the G20 in the push for stronger international co-operation and transparency in tax matters as well their Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit shifting (BEPS), aimed at tackling tax avoidance.

Stewart Levine demonstrates the superiority of \"agreements for results\" versus \"agreements for protection\" and outlines ten principles for creating agreements that explicitly articulate desired outcomes and provide a roadmap to achieving them. He includes over thirty specific templates that can be used to create this new type of agreement for results in a variety of organizational and personal contexts.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Government Contracting"]},{"id":"9781119676805","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"QuickBooks 2021 All-in-One For Dummies","authors":["Stephen L.

The Grit Factor.\n\nAt age nineteen, Shannon Huffman Polson became the youngest woman ever to climb Denali, the highest mountain in North America. She went on to reach the summits of Mt. Rainier and Mt. Kilimanjaro and spent more than a decade traveling the world. Yet it was during her experience serving as one of the Army's first female attack helicopter pilots, and eventually leading an Apache flight platoon on deployment to Bosnia-Herzegovina, that she learned the lessons of leadership that forever changed her life.\n\nWhere did these insights come from? From her own crucibles of experience—and from other women. In writing The Grit Factor, Polson made it her mission to connect with an elite pack of tough, impressive female iconoclasts who shared with her their candid stories of combat and career. This slate of decorated leaders includes Heather Penney, one of the first female F-16 pilots, who was put on a suicide mission for 9/11; General Ann Dunwoody, the first female four-star general in the Army; Amy McGrath, the first female Marine to fly the F/A-18 in combat and a 2020 candidate for the US Senate—and dozens of other unstoppable women who got there first, including Polson herself.\n\nThese women led at the highest levels in the most complicated, challenging, and male-dominated organization in the world. Now, when positive role models of women leading are needed as never before, Polson brings these voices together, sharing her own life lessons and theirs with storytelling flair, keen insight, and incisive analysis of current research.\n\nWith its gripping narrative and relatable takeaways, The Grit Factor is both inspiring and pragmatic, a book that will energize and enlighten current and aspiring leaders everywhere—whether male or female.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"1562863444","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Coaching Training","authors":["Chris W.

All it takes is collaboration between you and your teamworking together and making small, doable changes.What started as an experiment with a six-person team at The Boston Consulting Groupone of the world’s elite management consulting firmstriggered a global initiative that eventually spanned more than nine hundred BCG teams in thirty countries across five continents.

When Bachelder was named CEO of Popeyes in the fall of 2007, guest visits had been declining for years, restaurant sales and profit trends were negative, and the company stock price had dropped from $34 in 2002 to $13. The brand was stagnant, and relations between the company and its franchise owners were strained. By 2014, average restaurant sales were up 25 percent, and profits were up 40 percent. Popeyes' market share had grown from 14 percent to 21 percent, and the stock price was over $40. The franchisees were so pleased with the turnaround that they began reinvesting in the brand, rapidly remodeling restaurants, and building new units around the world. The difference maker, Bachelder says, was a conscious decision to lead in a new way. She and her team created a workplace where people were treated with respect and dignity yet challenged to perform at the highest level. Silos and self were set aside in favor of collaboration and team play. And the results were measured with rigor and discipline.

They discuss their experiences and offer guidance on topics such as balancing family and career, building alliances, mentoring and being mentored, and overcoming obstacles in the business world which is still dominated by men in the senior levels of management. Drawn from a range of industries including higher education, technology, law, the military, politics, the media, and more, these stories provide the details that every ambitious woman needs to know. You'll learn which skills, attributes, and relationships served these women best, how they overcame the obstacles thrown into their paths, and the people they credit as instrumental along the way. A self-assessment chapter helps you discover your own leadership attributes, and determine which skills you need to acquire as you formulate your own personal roadmap to the top.\n\nThere are many books about women who have been excellent leaders, but Real Women, Real Leadership provides the personal, relatable testimonials from women who have navigated the opportunities and pitfalls of the business world. Each story sheds light on women's unique leadership attributes, and provides guidance for professional women charting their own professional advancement.\n\nLearn from women leaders in a diverse range of industries\n\nDiscover the leadership attributes that make the biggest impact\n\nGain insight into work/life balance, mentors, relationships, and more\n\nDiscover your leadership strengths and develop a plan forward\n\nStudies have shown that companies with three or more women board members dramatically outperform the competition in returns on equity, sales, and invested capital — yet women only claim a tiny percentage of boardroom seats and top executive positions.

Real Women, Real Leadership tackles these questions and more from an in-the-trenches perspective to help you become the leader you want to be.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Career Development"]},{"id":"9781631574344","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Relationship Marketing Re-Imagined","authors":["Naresh K.

However, financial innovation will only succeed if it reflects the true lessons of the past decade. In this collection, three leading global finance researchers share those lessons, offering crucial insights for market participants, policymakers, and other stakeholders. Drawing on their pioneering work, they illuminate new opportunities for sustainable innovation in finance that can help restore housing markets and the overall global economy, while avoiding the failures of predecessors. In Financing the Future, Franklin Allen and Glenn Yago carefully discuss the current role of financial innovation in capitalizing businesses, industries, breakthrough technologies, housing solutions, medical treatments, and environmental projects. Allen and Yago explain how sophisticated capital structures can enable companies and individuals to raise funding in larger amounts for longer terms at lower cost, accomplishing tasks that would otherwise be impossible -- and offer a full chapter of essential lessons for using financial innovation to add value, manage risk, and improve the stability of the global economy. Next, in Fixing the Housing Market, Allen, Yago, and James R. Barth explain how responsible financial innovation can \"reboot\" damaged housing markets, improve their efficiency, and make housing more accessible to millions. The authors walk through the history of housing finance, evaluate housing finance systems in mature economies during and after the crisis, highlight benefits and risks associated with each leading mortgage funding structure and product, and assess current housing finance structures in BRIC economies. Building on these comparisons, they show how to create a more stable and sustainable financing system for housing: one that provides better shelter for more people, helps the industry recover, and creates thousands of new jobs.\n\nFrom world-renowned leaders and expertsFranklin Allen, Glenn Yago, and James R.

The modern enterprise, be it a large corporation or a government agency, has two key dimensions of complexity: static and dynamic. The static complexity refers to the remarkable number of companies and agencies that enable delivery of the product or service. A static \"snapshot\" of this end-to-end enterprise would reveal hundreds if not thousands of companies involved in the supply network and many additional firms involved in the distribution and delivery to customers. Planning, communication, coordination and execution of this large system network is fundamentally challenging just because of the sheer size. This large, extended network represents the static complexity. The dynamic complexity arises from the difficulty of managing the performance of this extended enterprise over time. This requires having the appropriate metrics to track performance over time, the management skills to develop strategies, the ability to collect and monitor the correct data for true visibility, and the recognition and understanding of the long lags between actions and results. Design, Analysis and Optimization of Supply Chains: A System Dynamic Approach incorporates real-world examples and cases, representing actual complex enterprise systems including firms involved and with long lead times, to illustrate the multi-faceted activities occurring within a modern supply chain and the challenges they pose to managers. Simulation and optimization techniques are introduced and used to develop strategies for improved performance.","tags":["Business","Operations","Supply Chain Management"]},{"id":"0814407404","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"THE LEADER AS COMMUNICATOR: STRATEGIES AND TACTICS TO BUILD LOYALTY, FOCUS EFFORT, AND SPARK CREATIVITY","authors":["Robert Mai","Alan Akerson"],"pages":"279","publication_date":"March 2003","description":"In turbulent times, the ability to communicate with power and purpose becomes a crucial leadership competency.

For example: Why will people drive 45 minutes to use a $2.00 coupon? Why won’t people sell a poor performing stock just because they inherited it from grandma? Why do people spend differently with a credit card than they do with cash? Why do people believe that they paid no income taxes because they received a refund? You’ll learn why the financial meltdown has amplified the impact of these all-too-human cognitive mistakes and discover ideas for addressing them.\n\nThe bottom line for your bottom line is that retirement can no longer be ignored, viewed as a single event, relegated to a “zone,” or romanticized. Instead, you must understand how every spending and financial decision you make from here on can impact the way you will spend your golden years. Retirementology attempts to help you do just that.\n\nRetirement planning: right brain versus left brain\n\nWhy these different areas of the brain impact financial decisions--and what to do about it\n\nIt’sreal money!“De-layering” your finances\n\nHow to overcome the psychological tricks that separate you from your money\n\nFamily matters: managing financial support decisions for your extended family\n\nChoosing between your family or your retirement\n\nGet “long-term smart”\n\nHow longevity, inflation, volatility, and your own expectations impact your retirement goals","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Personal Finance"]},{"id":"9780240809212","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Real-World Media Ethics","authors":["Philippe Perebinossoff"],"pages":"352","publication_date":"July 2012","description":"The Los Angeles Times recently reported that the word \"integrity was the most looked up word on Merriam-Webster's online dictionary, suggesting that people are looking for guidance in a scandal-driven world.

Take heed. Author and serial CEO Dick Cross pulls back the curtain on this top leadership role, explaining in his new book that being a successful leader, running a business, and doing it extraordinarily well isn’t a full-time job. How do you successfully lead and run a business? The answer may surprise you. Cross suggests that the most important, and often overlooked, duty for a CEO is thinking about how to improve his or her business and how to be a leader. In 60-Minute CEO, Cross explains that the essential elements of the CEO role can be accomplished in several 60-minute sessions every week. Executives may fill their time with other tasks, but leading and running a company requires explicit skills different from those needed for any other corporate position. The good news is that those skills are easy to learn, fun to do, and not time-consuming. In an entertaining style, Cross offers executives the fast track to the top leadership position, focusing on two aspects: thinking and character. And while 60 minutes may seem like a quick fix, as Cross sees it, three 60-minute sessions a week devoted solely to considering your business and your role as leader are crucial to business and leadership success—and the payoff is proven. In 60-Minute CEO, Dick Cross brings over 25 years of experience of transforming companies in various stages of underperformance into industry powerhouses. Cross combines his knowledge and experience with the stories and lessons of preeminent leaders and thinkers including General George Patton and Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9780814409183","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Employer’s Legal Advisor","authors":["Thomas M.

There were searing questions about how the crisis was allowed to happen and calls for immediate reform from Capital Hill, the news media, and the general public. Multiple scandals sent real fear through the investing community and brought unprecedented heat on the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). There was little doubt that the SEC had to fix rules that permitted bad behavior, shake off decades of complacency and enforce existing laws.\n\nWall Street lawyer Norm Champ spent nearly 20 years dealing with the SEC on behalf of his clients and as an industry representative working to educate the agency about hedge funds. Believing he could help reform the deeply-flawed agency, Champ left his career in the private sector and joined the SEC. As Director of the Division of Investment Management, he became a key player in stabilizing trillions of dollars of investor capital while reenergizing the SEC’s culture and management.\n\nIn Going Public, Champ presents a rare, insider’s look at how the SEC operates and explains exactly how the agency impacts the overall economic health of the country. He examines the inner workings of hedge funds, economic policy and politics, investing, and inefficient and frustrating federal agencies.

More and more, AI-based machines are replacing human beings, and online environments are gathering our data and using it to manipulate us. This loss of human autonomy amounts to nothing less than a societal phase change, a fundamental paradigm shift. The same institutions will remain—schools, banks, churches, and corporations—but they will radically change form, obey new rules, and use new tools. William H. Davidow and Michael S. Malone go deeply into the enormous implications of these developments. They show why increases in productivity no longer translate into increases in the GDP and how zero cost, one-to-many communications have been turned into tools for cybercrime and propaganda. Many of the book's recommendations—such as using taxes to control irresponsible internet behavior and enabling people to put their data into what are essentially virtual personal information “safety deposit boxes”—are bold and visionary, but we must figure out how we will deal with these emerging challenges now, before the Autonomous Revolution overcomes us.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Innovation"]},{"id":"9781422170885","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Decide and Deliver","authors":["Marcia Blenko","Michael C.

How can your company make the most of this potential competitive advantage and business strategy? Kellie McElhaney, one of the world's leading experts on CSR strategy, offers a detailed process for seamlessly integrating your CSR efforts into your overall business objectives. “My goal,” she writes, “is not to tell you how to force your CSR strategy to be more authentic. My goal is actually to help you develop a CSR strategy that is authentic because of its natural linkage to your company's mission, vision, and values.” Just Good Business lays out a framework of seven principles that help you develop CSR initiatives that make good business sense and tell the world about them in ways that are compelling and memorable. McElhaney offers a wealth of practical advice on implementation, including how to measure the results of your CSR. McElhaney draws on over ten years of previously unpublished CSR consulting engagements inside companies grappling with developing strategically aligned CSR initiatives. The book's case vignettes, examples, best practices, and strategic recommendations span a host of industries and sectors and draw upon her work with leading corporations, such as McDonald's, Nokia, Levi Strauss, Digicel, Birkenstock, Gap Inc., HP, and Pepperidge Farm.

Forman"],"pages":"54","publication_date":"March 2007","description":"The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is an advanced technique that supports decision makers in structuring complex decisions, quantifying intangible factors, and evaluating choices in multiobjective decision situations. It is a comprehensive and rational decision-making framework that provides a powerful methodology for determining relative worth among a set of elements. AHP is especially suitable for complex decisions that involve the comparison of decision elements which are difficult to quantify. The AHP, and its more recent version the Analytic Network Process (ANP), were developed by Dr. Thomas Saaty and have been applied in a wide variety of decision situations in organizations worldwide. AHP is particularly applicable in managing software complexity, and in Quality Function Deployment (QFD), as presented in Chapter 11 of the book Design for Trustworthy Software.\n\nThis short cut illustrates the application of AHP in prioritizing complex design issues. It also shows how AHP and its supporting software, Expert Choice (EC), can handle much higher levels of complexities accurately and expeditiously than the prioritization matrices introduced in Chapter 7 of Design for Trustworthy Software. In addition to solutions facilitated by EC, this short cut also illustrates two known approximations to AHP solutions using manual calculations. Manual calculations can be used to solve relatively less complex problems. They are presented in this short cut to illustrate the first principles and the steps involved in AHP.\n\nThis short cut is a reproduction of Chapter 8 of the book Design for Trustworthy Software and introduces AHP with a simple example. It can be used either as a methodology in trustworthy software design process or as a standalone introductory presentation on AHP.\n\nThis short cut should be of interest to software and quality professionals. In particular, it would be of value to the CMMI, Six Sigma, and DFSS communities worldwide, especially those who have acquired or plan to acquire Green Belt, Black Belt, Master Black Belt, or similar competencies in various quality management disciplines.

Some seek a major overhaul of the statute, arguing that considerable cleanup still needs to be done. Others oppose major changes, asserting that cleanup is almost complete. One of the most contentious issues in the debate is whether the taxes that once stocked the Superfund Trust Fund need to be reinstated. The answer depends in large part on how much money EPA will need to implement the Superfund program. To inform this discussion, the U.S. Congress asked Resources for the Future (RFF) to estimate the program's future costs. The results of this research are included in Superfund's Future, a book that will become an essential reference for all participants in the debate about one of the nation's most controversial environmental programs.","tags":["Business","Operations","Green Business Practices"]},{"id":"9781631576485","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Deconstructing Management Maxims, Volume I","authors":["Kevin Wayne"],"pages":"136","publication_date":"February 2017","description":"A contrarian challenge to the status quo, this book vigorously champi­ons healthy skepticism in management theory and practice.

But few realize that being a sponsor is just as important to career growth as finding one.\n\nAccording to new research from economist and thought leader Sylvia Ann Hewlett, senior executives who sponsor rising talent are 53 percent more likely to be promoted than those who don't. Similarly, middle-level managers who have proteges are 167 percent more likely to be given stretch assignments. Well-chosen proteges contribute stellar performance, steadfast loyalty, and capabilities that you, the sponsor, may lack, thus increasing how fast and how far you can go.\n\nBut how do you find standout proteges, let alone develop them so that they're able to come through for you and your organization?\n\nThis book has the answers you need. Combining powerful new data and rich examples drawn from in-depth interviews with leaders from companies such as Unilever, Aetna, Blizzard Entertainment, and EY, The Sponsor Effect provides a seven-step playbook for how you can become a successful sponsor.

When leadership practices fit the customer promise and company type, the organization thrives. But apply the wrong practices and the mismatch pulls the enterprise apart.

If you know how well the customer experience is satisfying your customers and you know how to increase their satisfaction, you can then increase sales, return visits, recommendations, loyalty, and brand engagement across all channels. More reliable and more useful data leads to better decisions and better results. Innovating Analytics is also about the need for a comprehensive measurement ecosystem to accurately assess and improve the other elements of customer experience. This is a time of great change and great opportunity. The companies that use the right tools and make the right assessments of how to satisfy their customers will have the competitive advantage.\n\nInnovating Analytics introduces an index that measures a customer's likelihood to recommend and the likelihood to detract. The current concept of the Net Promoter Score (NPS) that has been adopted by many companies during the last decade—is no longer accurate, precise or actionable. This new metric called the Word of Mouth Index (WoMI) has been tested on hundreds of companies and with over 1.5 million consumers over the last two years.\n\nAuthor Larry Freed details the improvement that WoMI provides within what he calls the Measurement Ecosystem.

Whether it sells computers, clothing, or cars, your firm's fate is increasingly linked to that of many other firms, all of which must collaborate effectively in order for each to thrive. This phenomenon has changed the basis of competition from battle between firms to battles between networks of firms--and more than ever before, success depends on managing assets your company doesn't own.\n\nIn The Keystone Advantage, Marco Iansiti and Roy Levien offer a new lens for understanding how these ubiquitous and complex business networks behave and explore the implications for strategy formulation, innovation, and operations management. Iansiti and Levien argue that biological ecosystems provide a powerful analogy to the functioning of business networks. Just as \"keystone species\" in nature play central roles in their ecosystems, companies such as Walmart, Microsoft, and Li & Fung deploy \"keystone strategies\" to actively shape and regulate the workings of their business ecosystems--dramatically improving their own performance in the process. Iansiti and Levien argue that the best keystones simplify the challenge of connecting a very large and distributed network of companies to their customers and provide \"platforms\" that other firms can leverage to increase productivity, enhance stability, and spur innovation.\n\nDrawing from more than ten years of research and practical experience across a range of industries, the authors identify three specific roles that firms play within business ecosystems: keystone, dominator, and niche. The book lays out a framework any firm can use to assess the characteristics of its own ecosystem, reevaluate its technology and operations strategy, and formulate specific tactics for gaining sustainable competitive advantage.\n\nPractical and insightful, The Keystone Advantage will help leaders, managers, and policy makers to understand, analyze, and successful execute strategy in today’s networked environments.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy"]},{"id":"9781947843424","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Developing Strengths-Based Project Teams","authors":["Martha Buelt","Connie Plowman"],"pages":"172","publication_date":"September 2018","description":"Developing Strengths-Based Project Teams integrates common project management and strengths-based talent development language to help you and your project team learn about and become a strengths-based project team.\n\nEveryone has talents and strengths.

Few people had a chance to age. Today, thanks to extraordinary medical, demographic, and economic shifts, most of us expect to live long lives. Consequently, the world is witnessing a powerful new version of retirement, driven by the power and needs of the Baby Boomer generation. Consumers over age 50 account for more than half of all spending and control more than 70% of our total net worth – yet are largely ignored by youth-focused marketers. How will work, family, and retirement be transformed to accommodate two billion people over the age of 60 worldwide? In the coming years, we’ll see explosive business growth fueled by this unprecedented longevity revolution.  What Retirees Want presents the culmination of 30 years of research by world-famous \"Age Wave\" expert Ken Dychtwald, Ph.D., and author and consultant Robert Morison. It explains how the aging of the Baby Boomers will forever change our lives, businesses, government programs, and the consumer marketplace. This exciting new stage of life, the \"Third Age,\" poses daunting questions:\n\nWhat will \"old\" look like in the years ahead? With continued advances in longevity, all of the traditional life-stage markers and boundaries will need to be adjusted.\nWhat new products and services will boom as a result of this coming longevity revolution? \nWhat unconscious ageist marketing practices are hurting people – and business growth? \nWill the majority of elder boomers outlive their pensions and retirement savings and how can this financial disaster be prevented?\nWhat incredible new technologies of medicine, life extension, and human enhancement await us in the near future?\nWhat purposeful new roles can we create for elder boomers so that the aging nations of the Americas, Europe, and Asia capitalize on the upsides of aging?\nWhich pioneering organizations and companies worldwide have created marketing strategies and programs that resonate with the quirky and demanding Boomer generation?\n\nIn this entertaining, thought-provoking, and wide-ranging book, Dychtwald and Morison explain how individuals, businesses, non-profits, and governments can best prepare for a new era – where the needs and demands of the \"Third Age\" will set the lifestyle, health, social, marketplace, and political priorities of generations to come.","tags":["Business","Economics","Next Economy"]},{"id":"9781466563292","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Implementing Standardized Work","authors":["Alain Patchong"],"pages":"93","publication_date":"October 2012","description":"This book, the first in The One-Day Expert series dedicated to Standardized Work, is about operator performance measurement.

The Lean Prescription: Powerful Medicine for Our Ailing Healthcare System tells the story of how Dr. Gabow led Denver Health to become the first healthcare organization to be awarded the Shingo Bronze Medallion Prize for Operational Excellence.Detailing the foundational Lean principles, the book provides readers with the benefit of the experience of an integrated healthcare system's successful seven-year Lean journey. This book grew out Gabow’s 40 years' experience as a practicing physician, teacher, researcher, and leader of a large, urban public healthcare system.About 10 years into her 20 years as CEO of the healthcare system, she began to look at how one could actually make healthcare work right. After a year of study, she and her team concluded that Lean was exactly what healthcare needed. During the seven-year Lean journey that followed, Denver Health dramatically improved quality of care. Denver Health achieved a reduction of the expected mortality rate to the lowest among the academic health center members of the University Health System Consortium in 2011.The financial results were equally impressive. Denver Health realized almost $200 million of well-documented, hard financial benefit over seven years.This book provides authoritative guidance on how to effectively implement a Lean transformation in a healthcare system that includes hospitals, HMOs, community health centers, call centers, and paramedics. Providing an accessible explanation of the Lean philosophy and tools, the book includes helpful exercises and examples of Lean applications. The book goes beyond the hospital environment to the broader healthcare sector.\n\nIn December 2015, Gabow and Goodman were awarded the Shingo Research and Professional Publication Award for the book. The Shingo Research and Professional Publication Award recognizes and promotes research and writing regarding new knowledge and understanding of lean and operational excellence.","tags":["Business","Project & Product Management","Product Management","Lean"]},{"id":"9781439894194","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Finance Policy for Renewable Energy and a Sustainable Environment","authors":["Michael Curley"],"pages":"258","publication_date":"March 2014","description":"Environmental finance is about creating the greatest environmental benefit for the largest number of people at the lowest possible cost.

Studies repeatedly point to the impact communication skills have on the ability of managerial leaders to succeed or fail. Too often individuals move into managerial leadership roles without awareness of the need to improve their communication skills. These individuals may be subject matter experts whose technical skills allowed them to succeed as individual team members, but when placed in managerial leadership roles, they fail because they lacked the relationship building skills needed to foster teamwork. Therefore, this book provides the communication principles that are so critical for today's managerial leader. It builds a solid foundation while it guides readers in strategies to enhance their written, oral, and interpersonal communication skills. Most research has stated, and the author has found true in her own managerial leadership roles, a leader spends the majority of his or her day interacting with others. As managerial leaders, individuals face many challenging situations such as determining how to inspire a shared vision about goals and objectives, building trust within their unit, listening with an open mind, giving feedback, and encouraging collaboration, to name a few. The focus switches for the managerial leader from doing things to leading others. Therefore, this book is for anyone who currently serves as a managerial leader or for anyone who desires to manage and lead others. Most managerial communication books focus on the important written and oral communication skills. While the author believes these skills are critically important, she found in her role, as a managerial leader, she devoted the majority of her time to interpersonal communication. Leaders need to build teams and to maintain relationships with all stakeholders. The best way to make that happen is through skills such as listening, asking questions, and giving feedback. Therefore, this book includes an emphasis on interpersonal communication. As Chris M. Martin stated in a recent article, \"The ability to communicate effectively may be the number one management quality.\" Therefore, this book will raise awareness relative to oral, written, and interpersonal communication skills so that individuals can become better managerial leaders.","tags":["Business","Project & Product Management","Product Management","Communication Strategy"]},{"id":"9780596157777","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Twitter API: Up and Running","authors":["Kevin Makice"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"March 2009","description":"This groundbreaking book provides you with the skills and resources necessary to build web applications for Twitter.

But in managing talent, most firms still use one-size-fits-all HR practices. With today's diverse workforces, this approach is preventing organizations from attracting, retaining, and leveraging top talent.In Workforce of One, Susan Cantrell and David Smith show how exceptional companies are tailoring work experiences to employees' talents and interests-customizing job duties, training, recognition, and even compensation, work schedules, and performance appraisals. Their reward? Lower turnover, greater productivity, improved profit margins.The authors present four customization strategies: -Segmenting your workforce; for example, by life stage and learning style -Offering modular choices; e.g., choices regarding rewards, learning needs, or job duties -Defining broad and simple rules, such as evaluating work by outcomes, not time invested, or hiring for potential in addition to specific skills -Fostering employee-defined personalization, whereby employees define their own people practices (e.g., using peer-to-peer technologies to learn from one another) Drawing on extensive proprietary research, the authors explain how to combine aspects of all four strategies to address your organization's unique needs. Improving workforce performance through customized work experiences is the holy grail of the HR function.

In Making the World Work Better: The Ideas That Shaped a Century and a Company, journalists Kevin Maney, Steve Hamm, and Jeffrey M. O’Brien mark the Centennial of IBM’s founding by examining how IBM has distinctly contributed to the evolution of technology and the modern corporation over the past 100 years.\n\nThe authors offer a fresh analysis through interviews of many key figures, chronicling the Nobel Prize-winning work of the company’s research laboratories and uncovering rich archival material, including hundreds of vintage photographs and drawings. The book recounts the company’s missteps, as well as its successes. It captures moments of high drama — from the bet-the-business gamble on the legendary System/360 in the 1960s to the turnaround from the company’s near-death experience in the early 1990s. The authors have shaped a narrative of discoveries, struggles, individual insights and lasting impact on technology, business and society. Taken together, their essays reveal a distinctive mindset and organizational culture, animated by a deeply held commitment to the hard work of progress.\n\nIBM engineers and scientists invented many of the building blocks of modern information technology, including the memory chip, the disk drive, the scanning tunneling microscope (essential to nanotechnology) and even new fields of mathematics. IBM brought the punch-card tabulator, the mainframe and the personal computer into the mainstream of business and modern life. IBM was the first large American company to pay all employees salaries rather than hourly wages, an early champion of hiring women and minorities and a pioneer of new approaches to doing business--with its model of the globally integrated enterprise. And it has had a lasting impact on the course of society from enabling the US Social Security System, to the space program, to airline reservations, modern banking and retail, to many of the ways our world today works.\n\nThe lessons for all businesses — indeed, all institutions — are powerful: To survive and succeed over a long period, you have to anticipate change and to be willing and able to continually transform. But while change happens, progress is deliberate. IBM — deliberately led by a pioneering culture and grounded in a set of core ideas — came into being, grew, thrived, nearly died, transformed itself… and is now charting a new path forward for its second century toward a perhaps surprising future on a planetary scale.","tags":["Business"]},{"id":"9780134008127","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Disrupt: Think the Unthinkable to Spark Transformation in Your Business","authors":["Luke Williams"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"September 2015","description":"&>Master a complete five-step program for identifying and executing on disruptive business opportunities!  Now updated and even more effective, Luke Williams' Disrupt, Second Edition combines the design industry's most powerful \"disruptive thinking\" techniques with real business implementation discipline.\n\nDrawing on his pioneering experience innovating at the legendary frog design (and teaching innovation at NYU), Williams shows exactly how to generate and execute on a steady stream of disruptive strategies.

Demoulas, the company's managers and rank-and-file workers struck back. Risking their own livelihoods to restore the job of their beloved boss they walked out, but they didn't walk far.

Although economics is sometimes dismissed as a discourse of practical relevance to only a relatively small circle of academicians and policy analysts who call themselves economists, sound economic reasoning benefits any manager of a business, whether they are involved with production/operations, marketing, finance, or corporate strategy. Along with enhancing decision making, the field of economics provides a common language and framework for comprehending and communicating phenomena that occur within a business, as well as between a business and its environment. This text addresses the core of a subject commonly called managerial economics, which is the application of microeconomics to business decisions. Key relationships between price, quantity, cost, revenue, and profit for an individual firm are presented in form of simple conceptual models. The text includes key elements from the economics of consumer demand and the economics of production. The book discusses economic motivations for expanding a business and contributions from economics for improved organization of large firms. Market price quantity equilibrium, competitive behavior, and the role of market structure on market equilibrium and competition are addressed. Finally, the text considers market regulation in terms of the generic problems that create the need for regulation and possible remedies for those problems. Although the academic literature of managerial economics often employs abstract mathematics and large corporations create and use sophisticated mathematical models that apply economics, this book focuses on concepts, terminology, and principles, with minimal use of mathematics. The reader will gain a better understanding of why businesses and markets function as they do and how those institutions can function better.","tags":["Business","Economics"]},{"id":"9780470640043","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Dice Have No Memory: Big Bets and Bad Economics from Paris to the Pampas","authors":["William Bonner"],"pages":"352","publication_date":"April 2011","description":"Right now, Congress, the Fed, and the Treasury are all gambling with your future and your money.

Current theories and practices cannot solve these problems, mainly because test specifications, especially lifetime tests, express their results as either pass or fail; these results thus provide little useful quantitative information. In a clear, concise presentation, Improving Reliability and Quality for Product Success discusses how to eradicate failures in hardware products and, consequently, achieve greater success in the marketplace.\n\nEvolved from the author’s more than thirty years of experience, the book redefines quality and reliability terminology, explains failure mechanics, and analyzes why reliability accidents occur in the products of established corporations. The author presents a new prevention methodology in easily understood qualitative and scientific terms. Without excess discussions of the complex related mathematics, he creates principles that enable readers to identify problems before product release into the market. These novel concepts and methodology can reduce product troubles by establishing test specifications that produce quantified outcomes that constitute conclusive judgment data.\n\nMany books that cover reliability theory/engineering/practice are geared towards professionals with advanced mathematical skills and would not necessarily be of use to executives and CEOs, who may not be quality or reliability experts but need to understand these principles when making decisions. This book addresses this important but neglected audience, introducing novel ideas based on back-to basics quality/reliability concepts in an easily understood manner. In addition, it explains basic, fresh new methods for maximizing customer satisfaction and securing a competitive edge in performance.","tags":["Business","Project & Product Management","Product Management"]},{"id":"9781606491553","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Production Line Efficiency","authors":["Sabry Shaaban"],"pages":"125","publication_date":"May 2010","description":"This book covers the area of unpaced, unbalanced production lines.

A series of experiments are presented to illustrate the issues involved in improving performance through production line imbalance.

But Harrison wasn’t content to uphold that reputation; he knew it could be even better. As an IRONMAN triathlete, he had a drive to push boundaries; as a two-time cancer survivor, he had a deeper empathy for patients and a greater sense of urgency. Harrison led an ambitious transformation that has unleashed Intermountain’s workforce not only to improve the organization but to look beyond it and tackle a range of problems that have plagued both the industry and our broader society. Bucking the prevailing culture of conflict and polarization, leaders at all levels are empowered to convene diverse stakeholders in unorthodox ways to solve problems that affect everyone.\n\nIn Possibility Unleashed, you’ll learn what happens when you:\n\nWalk in others’ shoes\nEmbrace an outsider’s perspective\nLook in the mirror\nFix what isn’t broken . . . yet\nUnlock the genius at the bedside (or at the front line)\nAsk “What if?”\nMake “frenemies”\nGo upstream\nStand up for what’s right\nColor outside the (red and blue) lines\n\nYou’ll find real-life examples of how this works in action—from a liberal, Harvard-trained program manager partnering with a leading gun rights advocate to address the issue of firearm-assisted suicides to a healthcare organization fighting high prices and drug shortages by working with its competitors to establish a not-for-profit generic drug company that benefits all. And while other health systems stand by as their communities struggle with poverty, crime, and other seemingly nonmedical issues, Intermountain is investing millions to address them, recognizing that they in turn profoundly affect people’s health. It’s a radical approach to leadership that shuns the status quo to create lasting transformative change. In Possibility Unleashed, you’ll discover the blueprint to making a far greater impact on society than you’d imagined while also building strong, financially healthy organizations where people love to work.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9780321492371","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Creating a Presentation in Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2007 for Windows: Visual QuickProject Guide","authors":["Tom Negrino"],"pages":"144","publication_date":"February 2007","description":"If you want to make a great presentation fast but don’t want to get bogged down in the details, then you need a Visual QuickProject Guide!You don’t need to know every feature—you just want to know how to get your project done.

There is a focus on the recently promoted notion of Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI), and some light is shed on the inevitable impediments of its meaningful implementation with respect to the normative structure of contemporary market societies. A particular matter of concern is the normative interlock between science and the market around the notion of neutrality, and the narrowing room for ethics reflexivity. The RRI Challenge outlines avenues for further conceptualization so that RRI can fulfil its emancipatory potential as social critique. This involves challenging the current politico-economic framework of the knowledge-creation process, and re-examining key conceptual dyads in innovation governance such as: governance/government, hard law/soft law, risk/fault, uncertainty/indeterminacy and morality/ethics.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy"]},{"id":"9780470527610","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Facebook® for Dummies®, 2nd Edition","authors":["Leah Pearlman","Carolyn Abram"],"pages":"348","publication_date":"November 2009","description":"The eagerly anticipated update to the bestselling first edition is here!\n\nFacebook's popularity is seemingly unstoppable.

Here, Gerald Harris uses seven concepts from quantum physics to pry open minds, eradicate unhealthy groupthink, spur creativity, and revitalize strategic planning.Explaining quantum concepts in plain language and using real-world examples, Harris inspires innovation while providing practical guidance for applying these ideas in actual planning situations. Just as light has a dual nature—it can be a wave and a particle—so the needs and wants of a customer can be both discrete and continuous, or the market focus of an organization can be both targeted and many faceted. Likewise, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle—that we cannot know both the position and the speed of an electron—reminds us that it is impossible to be aware of every single relevant fact before we make a decision. Planning, he shows, must be a learning-forward process that continually adjusts to new information. Harris's lessons act as triggers for inquiry, giving you an opportunity to discover more innovative and successful strategies.","tags":["Business"]},{"id":"53863MIT61131","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"What Tech Pioneers Can Learn From Emerging Markets","authors":["Frieda Klotz"],"pages":"6","publication_date":"June 2019","description":"Technology leaders are not shy about pushing the boundaries of their industries, and sometimes they go further — challenging the prevailing rules of society at large.

Woody Allen famously said that 80 percent of success is just showing up; but any entrepreneur can tell you that it's the other 20 percent that's key. The founders of Garden Fresh took that old saying to heart, building so many strategic advantages into their products and business that their 'sales' team didn't have to do any selling—they simply had to show up. In this book, you'll find out what kind of legwork goes into building a mega-success product, and the strategies, methods, and just plain stubbornness that helped two guys from Detroit build a market leader.\n\nGarden Fresh Gourmet is now the number-one fresh salsa in the US, shipping over a million units every week to Costco, Walmart, Whole Foods, and other national chains—and it all began with two middle-aged guys with negative funds and plenty of ideas. This book shares their journey, insight, and passion to help you build a better business and take it to the top.\n\nLearn how two entrepreneurs went from major debt to major revenue\nDiscover the key characteristics of a product that sells itself\nConsider why selling out might not be the ultimate goal\nTrack a journey of 'irrational persistence' from rags to riches\n\nGarden Fresh Gourmet is an inspiration beyond the journey—the way you run things at the top matters, too.

The CEO of a Fortune 500 firm explains it best: \"I am looking at 23 different strategic initiatives. Trying to develop and implement so many strategies is like trying to change the driver, tires, the oil, and the bumpers; paint the body; and tune the engine. And doing all of this on a car that's running at full speed.\"\n\nThe answer used to be found in strategy. But in the past decade, the commonly deployed large-scale strategic exercises were largely discredited. They were slow and elaborate and did not deliver the expected returns, let alone help make sense of a glut of initiatives or cope with an increasingly unpredictable future.\n\nThe Future of Strategy brings strategy back from those big top-down plans. It answers the questions of executives facing tumultuous business conditions and rapidly shifting markets: Is strategy still possible? Yes. Aren't strategies outdated before they can be implemented? Not if they are done right. Rather than developing strategy, aren't we better off being agile and able to capitalize on emerging trends faster than our peers? Agility complements strategy; it cannot replace it.\n\nThis book is about reversing course and repositioning strategy in its rightful place as the overarching management system. The authors introduce their core methodology, designed to future proof companies against the friction and \"fog of war\" that inexorably accompany changing times. They synthesize three fundamental principles that, when combined, provide the means to reclaim strategy:\n\nTake direct cues from fundamental trends affecting the company going forward\nEngage people across the company to translate these cues into strategy and effectively eliminate the handover hurdle between formulation and execution, a major reason for strategy failure\nCapture the output as competitive opportunities and manage their life cycles--when some have run their course, others are ready to take over\n\nStrategy today requires stepping over the shadows of one's own ingrained beliefs to capture new opportunities. This book reveals the inner workings of transformational strategies developed by leaders who gradually become more successful by advancing winning combinations of attitudes, values, habits, and practices.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy"]},{"id":"9781492048725","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Data, Money, and Regulation","authors":["Cornelia Lévy-Bencheton"],"pages":"30","publication_date":"September 2015","description":"Big data and the data science revolution have spawned new technologies and analytical approaches that have changed the course of many businesses—and could change the course of the banking industry.

The measure was humungous in scale and led to a sharp contraction in money supply for a short period. Although demonetization’s proponents have contended that it would cleanse the economy of black money and make transactions more formal and digital, its implementation certainly could have been better. The effects of demonetization on the Indian economy are debatable and will vary by sector. Its effectiveness will be talked about and studied by economists and policy makers for decades to come.\n\nDemonetization has made only a minor dent in the GDP. It has helped to bring more people into the tax net and has reduced the size of the informal economy. With the increased use of digital payments, economic transactions become recorded. This book examines the very concept, history, critique, and impact on the overall economy and black money, the move toward less-cash economy and digitalization, government–RBI relations, along with an assessment of two years of demonetization.

In 2019, the gap between the percentage of women and the percentage of men in the workforce was the smallest on record. But despite these statistics, women remain underrepresented in positions of power and status, with the highest-paying jobs the most gender-imbalanced. Even in fields where the numbers of men and women are roughly equal, or where women actually make up the majority, leadership ranks remain male-dominated.\n\nThe persistence of these inequalities begs the question: Why haven't we made more progress?\n\nIn Glass Half-Broken, Colleen Ammerman and Boris Groysberg reveal the pervasive organizational obstacles and managerial actions—limited opportunities for development, lack of role models and sponsors, and bias in hiring, compensation, and promotion—that create gender imbalances. Bringing to light the key findings from the latest research in psychology, sociology, organizational behavior, and economics, Ammerman and Groysberg show that throughout their careers—from entry-level to mid-level to senior-level positions—women get pushed out of the leadership pipeline, each time for different reasons.

Trillions of dollars of financial assets and shareholder value destroyed; worldwide GDP stalled; new jobs vanishingly scarce. But this isn’t just a severe recession. It’s evidence that our economic institutions are obsolete—a set of ideas inherited from the industrial age that no longer work for business, people, society, or the future. In The New Capitalist Manifesto, economic strategist Umair Haque argues that business as usual has outgrown the old paradigm of short-term growth, competition at all costs, adversarial strategy, and pushing costs onto future generations. These outworn assumptions are good for creating only “thin” value—gains that are largely illusory and produce diminishing returns every year. For “thick” value—enduring, meaningful, sustainable advantage that deeply benefits the larger society—Haque details five new cornerstones of prosperity in the twenty-first century:•Loss advantage: From value chains to value cycles•Responsiveness: From value propositions to value conversations •Resilience: From strategy to philosophy•Creativity: From protecting a marketplace to completing a marketplace•Difference: From goods to bettersThe New Capitalist Manifesto makes a passionate, razor-sharp economic case that these methods will produce a more enduring prosperity for business as well as society.","tags":["Business","Economics"]},{"id":"9781637425138","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Managing Millennials","authors":["Jacqueline Cripps"],"pages":"138","publication_date":"November 2023","description":"Leadership.

How integrated should economies really be? How much regulation is right? Many people fuse these two dimensions of choice into one, either favoring both globalization and deregulation—or opposing both of them.It doesn’t have to be that way.In World 3.0, award-winning author and economist Pankaj Ghemawat reveals the folly in both of these responses. He calls for a third worldview—one in which both regulation and cross-border integration coexist and complement one another.Ghemawat starts by exposing common assumptions about globalization to hard data, proving that the world is not nearly as globalized as we think. And he explains why the potential gains from further integration are much larger than even pro globalizers tend to believe. He then tackles market failures and fears—job losses, environmental degradation, macroeconomic volatility, and trade and capital imbalances—that opponents of globalization often invoke. Drawing on compelling data, he shows that increased globalization can actually alleviate some of these problems. Finally, Ghemawat describes how a wide range of players—businesses, policy makers, citizens, media—can help open up flows of ideas, people, and goods across borders, but in ways that maximize the benefits and minimize the potential side effects. World 3.0 dispels powerfully entrenched—but incorrect—assumptions about globalization. Provocative and bold, this new book explains how people around the world can secure their collective prosperity through new approaches to cross-border integration. Ghemawat’s thinking will surprise and move you—no matter where you stand on globalization.","tags":["Business","Economics"]},{"id":"9781631579769","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Hypocrisy of the African Public Finance Management Framework","authors":["Kamudoni Nyasulu"],"pages":"126","publication_date":"September 2017","description":"Huge headlines across Africa have lamented the debilitating effects of corruption and fraud on the African economies and development. But is Africa ready for this fight? Do the antifraud practitioners possess strategies to equip Africa for this fight? This book highlights some of the major challenges facing developing and post conflict African countries with regard to, among others, (1) policy, political will, and legal framework in the prevention and deterrence of fraud and corruption; (2) strategies and coordination of institutional frameworks and institutions; (3) lack of human and infrastructural resources; and (4) the time- and energy-intensive nature of fraud detection, investigation, and resolution. The leadership and citizens of these countries are aware of the effects of fraud and corruption, but lack the strategies and sometimes the resources to prevent, deter, detect, investigate, or resolve fraud and corruption incidences. This is compounded by huge deficits in compliance because laws are either ignored or deliberately contravened, and regulations and ethical practices are circumvented. The book makes comments on some initiatives that have been tried at different levels of governance to stimulate debate in search of effective approaches to equip Africa fight fraud and corruption.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance"]},{"id":"9781422172605","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Managing Change","authors":["Harvard Business Review"],"pages":"96","publication_date":"September 2009","description":"Every day on the job, you face common challenges.

She includes a timely discussion of how clarity of purpose can improve board and director effectiveness. Informed by her long experience serving public, private, and family owned corporate boards as well as those of charitable, and government organizations, she provides essential context regarding the evolution of board practice as well as candid discussion of the issues involved in the relentless effort to improve corporate governance processes.

Based on what? Are their decisions conscious or unconscious? Can they explain each decision they make? What tools can they use to improve their  decision-making process? What rules of thumb (heuristics) can they use when faced with decision-making challenges? These are some of the questions this book is about. During the past 30 years, as an entrepreneur and senior executive of several medium-sized Canadian hi-tech businesses, the author observed his decision-making processes to be based either on experience or on advice received from colleagues. Seldom were decisions based on formal or informal academic-based methods. Discussing decision-making methods with other executives of comparable business backgrounds confirms they rely on similar methods when looking for solutions to challenging business problems. There is no substitute for years of experience in any human endeavour. However, tapping into some of the methods and lessons learned from personal experience can result in useful principles for others to follow. These principles might be useful especially for entrepreneurs interested in building their businesses or executives looking for some additional help in acquiring a better decision-making mouse-trap.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy"]},{"id":"9781607284994","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Connection Culture","authors":["Michael Lee Stallard"],"pages":"160","publication_date":"April 2015","description":"Human connection affects much more than the bottom line.\n\nOrganizations thrive when employees feel valued, the environment is energized, and high productivity and innovation are the norm.
