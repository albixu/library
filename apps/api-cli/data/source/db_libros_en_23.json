But surprisingly little empirical evidence has captured either the magnitude of digital disruption or how incumbents are reacting. Leaders know they have a problem but lack guidance to determine the right course of action. In a global survey of 2,000 C-suite executives in more than 60 countries, McKinsey & Co. found that few companies are responding appropriately to digital disruption. While 90% of companies indicated that they are engaged in some form of digitization, only 16% said their companies have responded with a bold strategy and at scale; only 30% of companies are focusing on new ways to bundle demand or resegment their market. Based on these numbers, some leaders might assume that they have plenty of time to get their digital acts together. But the authors argue that this would be a dangerous assumption because new digital entrants are seizing a significant share of revenue across regions and industries.The authors highlight three bold tactics companies can use:1. Develop new customer segments. Rather than just defending existing business lines through cost cutting, automation, or service improvements for existing customers, companies should focus on developing new customer segments. Medialaan NV, a leading free-to-air video broadcaster in Belgium, spotted young customers moving to platforms such as Netflix or YouTube. In response, it bought a mobile virtual operator with attractive data plans, thus becoming one of the few traditional broadcast companies to grow its TV audience in the youth segment.2. Introduce new business models. Innovative companies are experimenting with business models intended to disrupt their own legacy strategies. When Schibsted Media Group of Oslo, Norway, saw that its print classified advertising was drying up, it moved the classified business to a free online marketplace. Today, more than 80% of the group’s earnings come from commissions on sales from its consumer e-commerce platform. 3. Redefine the value chain. When digital entrants threatened its payment services business, Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) chose to confront the disrupters head-on with a new open payments platform that hosts an ecosystem of applications and devices for merchants and is open to third-party developers. Although the platform and its ecosystem contribute to the disruption of the traditional banking value-add chain, it also positions CBA to compete with digital entrants.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Digital Transformation"]},{"id":"9780240521893","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Adobe Photoshop Elements 8 for Photographers","authors":["Philip Andrews"],"pages":"535","publication_date":"May 2013","description":"A complete reference guide for all levels of photographers who use Adobe Photoshop Elements.","tags":["Design","Design Tools","Adobe Design Tools","Adobe Photoshop"]},{"id":"0321438434","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Secrets of Podcasting: Audio Blogging for the Masses, Second Edition","authors":["Bart G.

In this series of essays, photographer and teacher Guy Tal shares his thoughts and experiences as an artist who seeks to express more in his images than the mere appearance of the subject portrayed. Tal makes an argument to consider creative landscape photography—expressing something of the photographer's conception through the use of natural aesthetics—as a form of visual art that is distinct from the mere representation of beautiful natural scenes. Tal covers topics such as the art of photography, approaches to landscape photography, and the experiences of a working photographic artist. His essays also include reflections on nature and man’s place in it, living a meaningful life, and living as an artist in today’s world. The book is decidedly non-technical and focuses on philosophy, nature, and visual expression. It was written for those photographers with a passion and interest in creative photography. Anyone who is pursuing their work as art, is in need of inspiration, or is interested in the writings of a full-time working photographic artist will benefit from reading this book. The book is visually punctuated with Tal’s inspiring and breathtaking photography. “Some images look like things, while others feel like things; some images are of things, while others are about things. …A creative image is not a record of a scene nor a substitute for a real experience. Rather, it is an experience in itself—an aesthetic experience—something new that the artist has given the world, rather than a contrived view of something that already existed independent of them.” ~Guy Tal **** Guy Tal’s photography is thoughtful, compassionate, and poetic; it’s no wonder then that his writings evoke similar feelings in me. If you want to be a better camera user, read your manual. If you want to be a stronger, deeper photographer, read Guy Tal. ~David duChemin","tags":["Design","Visual Design","Photography"]},{"id":"9780240516844","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Fine Cuts: The Art of European Film Editing","authors":["Roger Crittenden"],"pages":"416","publication_date":"August 2012","description":"Roger Crittenden reveals the experiences of many of the greatest living European film editors through his warm and perceptive interviews which offer a unique insight into the art of editing - direct from masters of the craft.\n\nIn their interviews the editors relate their experience to the directors they have worked with, including:\n\nAgnes Guillemot- (Godard, Truffaut, Catherine Breillat)\nRoberto Perpignani- (Welles, Bertolucci, Tavianni Brothers)\nSylvia Ingemarsson- (Ingmar Bergman)\nMichal Leszczylowski- (Andrei Tarkovsky, Lukas Moodysson)\nTony Lawson (Nic Roeg, Stanley Kubrick, Neil Jordan)\nand many more.\n\nForeword by Walter Murch - three-time Oscar-winning Editor of 'Apocalypse Now', 'The English Patient', 'American Graffiti', 'The Conversation' and 'The Godfather Part II and III'.","tags":["Design","Visual Design","Film & Video"]},{"id":"9780240810829","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Introduction to Media Production, 4th Edition","authors":["Gorham Kindem","Robert B.

Executives often know they must break with the status quo, but there are few signposts indicating the best way forward. Executives have long been exhorted to conduct analyses of internal and external environments and construct scenarios of the future. However, seeing strategy in this way has some serious weaknesses. It assumes that accuracy can be achieved through rigorous analysis and conscientious efforts to overcome individual biases in perception. It also assumes that the process will be relatively frictionless and primarily analytical. But research has found that most forecasting efforts fail to attain the desired precision.To study how managers make strategy in conditions of considerable uncertainty, the authors took an in-depth look at five technology strategy projects inside the Advanced Technology Strategy Group at a communications technology company that was experiencing a period of high industry turbulence. The authors observed managers’ struggles to forecast the future and discovered that managers could not imagine new futures for the company without rethinking the past and reconsidering present concerns. A new future could not shape strategic choices unless it was connected in a narrative that showed ho it relates to the past and the present. When managers settled on a particular narrative, they could make choices.Strategy making amid volatility thus involves constructing and reconstructing strategic narratives that reimagine the past and present in ways that allow the organization to explore multiple possible futures. In comparing strategy projects, the authors found that the more work managers do to create novel strategic narratives, the more likely they are to explore alternatives that break with the status quo. In other words, to get to an alternative future, you have to create a story about the past that connects to it Furthermore, the authors found that to gain traction within an organization, strategic narratives need to be seen as coherent, plausible and acceptable to most key stakeholders within the company.","tags":["Data","Data Science","Data Science Tasks","Statistics","Time Series","Forecasting"]},{"id":"9781484200131","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Pro Grunt.js","authors":["James Cryer"],"pages":"176","publication_date":"April 2015","description":"Pro Grunt.js gets you quickly up-to-speed with this popular JavaScript-based task runner.

Originally seen simply as a practical way to illuminate dark scenes with portable light, flash today is used for a host of creative and nuanced applications, including supplementing daylight, designing complex scenes lit by multiple light sources, and simply creating beautiful, controllable light for portraiture.\n\nWith LCD screens on DSLRs, the ability to get instant feedback on lighting setups is a great help in advancing one’s lighting capabilities and encouraging experimentation. However, flash photography can still be a difficult artistic and technical challenge. It’s simple to get that harsh deer-in-the-headlights look from built-in automatic flash, but it is a far cry from beautiful light. Creating natural-looking images is not nearly as straightforward. Mastering the properties of light and the ability to manipulate, craft, and direct it is a lifelong endeavor. Those diving into Speedlights need some help. Manuals are terse and the terminology is confusing—this is where Mastering Canon EOS Flash Photography comes in. \n\nThis is the complete book on the subject, guiding you through Canon’s Speedlite system, from off-camera portable flash to professional studio lighting. It covers the fundamentals of flash metering technology, discusses key lighting concepts, and documents a wide range of Canon and third-party equipment.

You just want to find what you need so you can move forward with your work. You're not alone. How Do I Do That Thing in InDesign? is here to answer your questions quickly and clearly.  \n\nAdobe InDesign is the clear software of choice for designers in desktop publishing and typesetting. With it, designers create professional, eye-catching posters, flyers, brochures, magazines, newspapers, presentations, books, and ebooks. But because it has so much power and depth, sometimes the things you need are…well…kinda hidden or not really obvious.\n\nThere will be a lot of times when you need to get something done in InDesign, but you have no idea where Adobe hid that feature, or what the “secret handshake” is to do that thing you need now so you can get back to working. That’s why this book was created: to get you to the technique, the shortcut, or exactly the right setting, right now.\n\nHere's how it works: When you need to know how to do a particular thing, you turn to the chapter where it would be found, find the thing you need to do (it’s easy—each page covers just one single topic), and designer and author Dave Clayton tells you exactly how to do it just like he was sitting there beside you, using the same casual style as if he were telling a friend. That way, you get back to working in InDesign fast.\n\nThis isn’t a book of theory, full of confusing jargon and detailed multi-step concepts.

With an imaginative design and a forward-thinking mission, Ableton continues their legacy with Live 9, a software package that drives music production to the cutting edge while squarely meeting the needs of the composer, producer, perform, songwriter, DJ, and beyond. With such a progressive approach to its development, some of you may feel a bit disoriented or even intimidated at first sight of Live’s unconventional design, especially those of you coming from a traditional Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) background. If you are new to DAWs, DJ style programs, or software music production in general, then you’ll soon be right at home with the \"parallel concept\" of Live’s Session and Arrangement Views. For the rest of you, you’ll have to rethink your approach to composing, arranging and producing music just a bit; but it will be a worthwhile adjustment. That is why this book has been written: to help reinvent the experienced software-based music producer and to unleash the new user. The goal here is to build and cultivate a strong understanding of Live 9’s concepts and to provide material that will engage all DAW users alike. With this goal in mind, at the end of each reading you should feel that your current skills and knowledge base have been elevated to the next level. For the current Ableton Love user – yes, you - there is plenty here to unlock!

Pinpoint and close vulnerabilities using effective computer forensics!\n\nThe primary purpose of computer forensics is to enable organisations to pinpoint where the malware has infected their computer systems and which files have been infected, so that they can close the vulnerability. More and more organisations have realised that they need to acquire a forensic capability to ensure they are ready to cope with an information security incident.\n\nThis pocket guide illustrates the technical complexities involved in computer forensics, and shows managers what makes the discipline relevant to their organisation. For technical staff, the book offers an invaluable insight into the key processes and procedures that are required.\n\nBenefits to business include:\nDefend your company effectively against attacks By developing a computer forensic capability, your organisation will be better prepared to defend itself in the event of a cyber attack. Surveys of the threat landscape have indicated a significant upswing of insider activity. Forensics within the organisation can be used to identify possible insider misuse of systems or information. In addition, this pocket guide looks at how you can optimise your IT infrastructure so as to enhance the efficiency of incident analysis. This will also minimise the operational impact on your computer systems in the event that a forensic analysis is required.\nBe proactive Being proactive does not just mean making sure your organisation's IT infrastructure is one that can support forensic analysis of incidents. Forensics is now no longer merely a tool to identify what has gone wrong: it can also be used as a mechanism for alerting you to the fact that something has gone wrong. Being proactive therefore implies stepping up your organisation's ability to detect attacks. Detection of attacks is an extremely useful attribute for your organisation to have: the sooner you know about the problem, the sooner you can begin to deal with it.\nSecure evidence that will stand up in court Undertaking forensics is not a simple task. It is not always possible to understand the true consequences of insider misuse until after completion of the investigation. Once the extent of the damage becomes clear, you may want to exercise the option of taking legal action against the perpetrator. This means that it is essential for you to follow correct procedure, so as to safeguard any evidence gathered. This book explains the key steps you need to take to maintain the integrity of the investigation and preserve the evidence.\nCounter encryption Encryption is a double-edged sword. Encryption has a legitimate purpose as a tool deployed by information security professionals. However, the opportunity to conceal data has obvious attractions for the criminal, meaning that encryption is also a technique widely used by hackers. This book looks at how encryption is used to impede a forensic investigation, and examines ways of solving the problem. The most effective tactic for countering encryption is to locate the key material and crack the password that protects it, using a password cracker such as Cain & Abel.\n\nTools, techniques and procedures\n\nThe underground economy makes millions of pounds a year from cybercrime. Because no system or network can be completely secure, any sensible organisation will have mechanisms in place in advance to deal with the consequences of a cyber attack. Digital forensics assists companies and public sector organisations to identify how and where their computer systems have been abused.\n\nThe purpose of this pocket guide is to provide an introduction to the tools, techniques and procedures utilised within computer forensics. It is an easy to understand, introductory text, which gives an overview of the digital forensics domain, discussing procedural, technical and human-related aspects, without confiusing readers with technical jargon.\n\n'...In view of the significance of information assets for modern organisations and the number of high profile incidents that come to the light of publicity, this Pocket Guide is an essential resource for every IT professional…'\n\nTheo Tryfonas, Lecturer in Systems Engineering, University of Bristol\n\nBuy this book and harness the power of computer forensics to benefit your organisation!","tags":["Security","Digital Forensics","Computer Forensics"]},{"id":"9781498736824","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"R for Programmers","authors":["Dan Zhang"],"pages":"374","publication_date":"January 2016","description":"Unlike other books about R, written from the perspective of statistics, this book is written from the perspective of programmers, providing a channel for programmers with expertise in other programming languages to quickly understand R.

Do your customers use any of these words to describe what you sellor how you sell it? If so, welcome to the club. Inundated by fakes and sophisticated counterfeits, people increasingly see the world in terms of real or fake. They would rather buy something real from someone genuine rather than something fake from some phony. When deciding to buy, consumers judge an offering's (and a company's) authenticity as much asif not more thanprice, quality, and availability. In Authenticity, James H. Gilmore and B. Joseph Pine II argue that to trounce rivals companies must grasp, manage, and excel at rendering authenticity. Through examples from a wide array of industries as well as government, nonprofit, education, and religious sectors, the authors show how to manage customers' perception of authenticity by: recognizing how businesses \"fake it;\" appealing to the five different genres of authenticity; charting how to be \"true to self\" and what you say you are; and crafting and implementing business strategies for rendering authenticity. The first to explore what authenticity really means for businesses and how companies can approach it both thoughtfully and thoroughly, this book is a must-read for any organization seeking to fulfill consumers' intensifying demand for the real deal.","tags":["Design","Branding"]},{"id":"9780240814698","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Focus On Photographing People","authors":["Haje Jan Kamps"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"November 2012","description":"Taking good photographs of people is a combination of many factors: What is the best light for the subject?

Bell"],"pages":"7","publication_date":"October 2012","description":"Online retailing is far and away the fastest growing retail sector in the United States. The growth is being fed by two forces: (1) traditional retailers are getting their “Internet acts” together, and (2) “pure play” retailers are becoming increasingly innovative.\n\nThe authors studied two groups: online retailers selling popular-brand consumables for the home, such as laundry detergent, pet supplies and diapers (represented by Netgrocer.com and Diapers.com); and online retailers selling specialty items, including fashion eyeglasses and apparel for men (represented by WarbyParker.com and Bonobos.com). They came up with a set of findings that may have important implications not just for pure-play Internet retailers but for more traditional retailers, too. Among them:\n\nIndividual consumer acceptance depends on offline shopping costs. For Internet retailers, the best market opportunities are with customers in locations where offline retail shopping is limited and costs (including sales tax) are high.\n\nSales evolution is structured and predictable. Although initial online sales in a particular region, and some geographic variation in sales across regions, may be driven by offline product costs, growth is fueled by the sharing of information among friends and neighbors. The authors’ research on Netgrocer.com, an online retailer that delivers groceries, found that ZIP codes with lots of new customers tended to be adjacent to areas that had high concentrations of customers in earlier periods.\n\nMigrating from “good” to “great” requires expansion to niche locations. Although sales emerge first in areas where customers face high offline shopping costs and are propagated through local customer interactions, in order for online retailers to extend their reach they need to tap into hundreds or thousands of markets that individually represent few sales but collectively add up to significant numbers.\n\nDifferent locations require different customer acquisition strategies. In ZIP codes with a high physical density of customers, offline word of mouth can be particularly powerful. Traditional print advertising tended to work well in less dense environments.","tags":["Business","Digital Economy","E-Commerce"]},{"id":"9780321637031","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Learning Quartz Composer: A Hands-On Guide to Creating Motion Graphics with Quartz Composer","authors":["Graham Robinson","Surya Buchwald"],"pages":"192","publication_date":"July 2012","description":"Create Amazing Real-Time Motion Graphics with Quartz Composer!\n\nApple’s Quartz Composer makes it amazingly easy to create real-time graphics of all kinds: for screensavers, animations, kiosk art, film effects, Dashboard Widgets, graphically-rich apps, and more.

To explore how digital technologies are changing the way companies do business, MIT Sloan Management Review and Deloitte surveyed more than 4,800 respondents and interviewed 19 business and thought leaders. The central question the authors asked: How are companies using digital technologies — such as social media, data and analytics, mobile devices and cloud computing — to compete and operate differently? Using results from these quantitative and qualitative data, the authors provide insights on the state of digital business and what managers need to know and do to navigate and benefit from these trends. A key concept behind this research is digital business maturity. The authors asked survey respondents to “imagine an ideal organization transformed by digital technologies and capabilities that improve processes, engage talent across the organization, and drive new and value-generating business models” and then to rate their company against that ideal on a scale of 1-10 (with 10 being the closest to the ideal). Forty-five percent of respondents placed their companies in the middle or “developing” group (ratings 4-6), while 29% put their companies in the higher “maturing” category (ratings 7-10). The remaining 26% placed their companies in the lower “early” group (ratings 1-3). Perhaps the main insight is that the key drivers of digital transformation are not the digital technologies themselves but business factors — in particular, strategy, culture and talent development. Effective digital strategies are less about acquiring and implementing the right technology than about reconfiguring the business to take advantage of the information these technologies enable. The authors found that the objectives of a company’s digital strategy also differ depending on digital maturity. The vast majority of companies surveyed want to use digital technologies to improve customer interactions. What differentiates the most mature companies, however, is a willingness to use digital to transform their business more broadly. Respondents expressed a strong preference for working for a digitally mature company. However, a surprisingly high number of employees were dissatisfied with how their companies were reacting to digital trends overall.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Digital Transformation"]},{"id":"53863MIT65323","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Are Enterprise Social Platforms All Talk?","authors":["Burcu Bulgurcu","Wietske Van Osch","Gerald C.

It’s more of that “Ah ha—so that’s how they do it,” straight-to-the-point, skip-the-technojargon stuff you can really use today that made part 1 so successful. In parts 1 through 4 of this series, the most popular chapter in the book has always been the last chapter: “Photo Recipes to Help You Get ‘The Shot’.” In each of those chapters, Scott shows a final image and then describes how to get that type of shot. Here, in part 5, he gives you what you’ve been waiting for: an entire book of nothing but those amazing photo recipes. But, he took it up a big notch by adding a behind-the-scenes photo for every single recipe. Now you can see exactly how it was done, so you can get that exact same look every time. In these extra pages, each spread allows you to dig in a little deeper and really unlock the power of these recipes. Scott breaks each spread into four segments: (1) he explains exactly what you’re seeing behind the scenes, (2) he lists all of his camera settings, and lens and lighting info—it’s all there, (3) he gives you his thought process, so you learn exactly why he does it this way, and (4) he shares all the post-processing in Lightroom or Photoshop that goes on after the shoot (this is something other books leave out). Plus, the whole book is packed with tips and insights you won’t find anywhere else. This isn’t a book of theory, full of confusing jargon and detailed concepts. This is a book on which button to push, which settings to use, and exactly how and when to use them. With around 100 of the most popular photographic “tricks of the trade,” the entire book is designed to get you shooting like a pro starting today. You’re gonna love it.","tags":["Design","Visual Design","Photography"]},{"id":"9780133005578","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Adobe® Dreamweaver® CS6 Classroom in a Book®","authors":["Adobe Creative Team"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"June 2012","description":"Creative professionals seeking the fastest, easiest, most comprehensive way to learn Adobe Dreamweaver CS6 choose Adobe Dreamweaver CS6: Classroom in a Book from the Adobe Creative Team.

We know this because they’ve actively listed one or more of these things as interests under their real names right next to their profile photo.\n\nUnfortunately, the amount of people who hope to turn their creativity into a professional career wildly outnumber the very select few who actually end up doing so. Why is that? Are they lazy? Uninformed? Uninspired?\n\nIn reality, it’s none of the above. The biggest reasons many amazingly gifted people never pursue a career in creativity are because they don’t know where to start or how to do so.\n\nProfessional creativity has always been a bit of an enigma to those who seek it. The average person believes every artist is a starving one, while the average artist will tell you there is an impenetrable wall between commerce and art.\n\n¿\n\nNeither of these statements is true, and the end result of all this misinformation is that many incredibly talented people don’t realize that there are others like them out in the world making a (rather good) living by doing something they love.\n\nThis book provides a comprehensive list of creative jobs in advertising, career best practices, and advice from experts in their field, helping talented creative people:\n\nUnderstand the vast universe of creative occupations in advertising\n\nChoose which career path to follow\n\nMaster the social and business politics of the creative world\n\nLearn the truth about the Advertising industry (the good, the bad, and the ugly) from people who are already making money doing it\n\nThere are many books about teaching people how to be creative or how to find their inner creativity. This is not one of those books.\n\nCreativity isn’t something you can actually teach. You either have it, or you don’t.\n\nThis book is for those who have it. You’ve heard how ridiculously talented you are your whole life. People already crave your work and envy your skills. Friends ask you for favors. “A+” is the baseline for your art. Your work has graced the front of refrigerators, dorm rooms, and cubicles for years.\n\nThis book is for you–the rock stars, juggernauts, and creative beasts who know you’re talented, but don’t know how to use your skills to attain and maintain a career. Whether you want a solo career, your own business, a position at a well-known company, or a promotion from within, this book will be your guide.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Marketing","Digital Marketing","Social Media Marketing"]},{"id":"9781457179402","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","authors":["James Johnson"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"December 2012","description":"The Canon EOS 5D Mark III is the latest in Canon's line of full-frame DSLR cameras.

TV is moving through a period of rapid change. Governments around the world are switching from analogue to digital forms of transmission to further expand the amount of content that TV signals can carry. At the same time, competition for eyeballs has also grown from outside that traditional marketplace with the emergence of the Internet. The roll-out of broadband and increased bandwidth has had the greatest impact on television because online technology can readily convey the same content. All these changes have created a great deal more competition for viewers within the traditional TV marketplace. The Internet has proven to be especially popular with young people who have adopted its applications to a far greater extent than their elders, though even the latter have now begun to take up online activities in significant numbers. Are these audiences the same? Do people make a choice between these two media or do they use them both at different times and for different reasons? Can television utilise the Internet in profitable ways to enhance its market position? Will television have to evolve from its current state to provide the kinds of content reception services to which people have become accustomed in the online world?

Kane"],"pages":"7","publication_date":"January 2016","description":"Few CEOs of large companies leverage the power of Twitter to the fullest extent. As of September 2014, only 42 Fortune 500 CEOs had Twitter accounts. The authors argue that rather than waiting for impressions to be driven by the media or by individuals with ulterior motives, CEOs can use Twitter to help shape their public image and that of their companies.\n\nThe authors studied the Twitter activity of 25 CEOs of publicly traded companies who were active on Twitter and identified common patterns and themes. Based on the type of content tweeted most often, the authors classified the CEOs they studied into four groups: Generalists, Expressionists, Information Mavens, and Business Mavens.\n\nGeneralists used Twitter to share a wide range of content. At times they tweeted about personal opinions and interests; other times, they tweeted information closely related to the business (for example, strategy, existing products and services, customer references, etc.). However, on average they had the smallest networks among the groups of CEOs, perhaps because they were not sharing information that was unique.\n\nExpressionists used Twitter extensively for non-business content sharing. These CEOs shared their opinions about events and politics and gave their followers an insight into their daily lives. In many ways, they used Twitter as a brand-building platform for themselves as they do for their companies.\n\nInformation Mavens frequently shared links to information, news, and other happenings. However, they did not generally tweet information specific to their company, acting more like curators of content. As a result, relatively few people retweeted or “favorited” their tweets.\n\nBusiness Mavens used Twitter extensively and primarily shared business-related content. In contrast to the other CEO groups that the authors identified, Business Mavens often shared new product announcements, information about existing products, customer references, and information about management initiatives and strategy. Although they also used Twitter to share content related to personal opinions and interests and links to other interesting information, the majority of their tweets were business-related. As a group, the Business Mavens produced tweets that were retweeted and favorited more often than those of CEOs in the other three groups, and they had significantly larger follower networks.\n\nThe authors’ research suggests that certain types of CEO tweets are more likely to be favorited and retweeted than others: tweets that provide new information about the company’s products and services; tweets that refer to external validation; and tweets that share customer stories and refer to customers.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Marketing","Digital Marketing","Social Media Marketing"]},{"id":"53863MIT59236","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Surviving in an Increasingly Digital Ecosystem","authors":["Peter Weill","Stephanie L.

The minimalist photographer works with the idea that the brain and the eye are far more important than the camera. Author Steve Johnson begins by asking you, the reader, to look inward and make the connections between your nature and your photography. Why do you want to take photographs and what subject matter are you attracted to? What type of photographer are you now and what type of photographer would you like to become? These are important questions to consider when deciding what approach works best for you. In subsequent chapters, you'll learn about the equipment and workflow of a minimalist photographer as Johnson discusses the strengths and weaknesses of various types of cameras and explains why the biggest or most expensive piece of equipment is not always the best. He also addresses the importance of lighting and teaches you how to achieve effective lighting without spending a lot of money. Also included are discussions about aesthetics and composition, as well as a brief history of photography and the future of the art form.","tags":["Design","Visual Design","Photography"]},{"id":"9781317359234","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Directors Tell the Story, 2nd Edition","authors":["Bethany Rooney","Mary Lou Belli"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"April 2016","description":"Move over, movies: the freshest storytelling today is on television, where the multi-episodic format is used for rich character development and innovative story arcs.

This book teaches programmers using simple examples and metaphors and explains the underlying concepts of writing effective automated unit tests. Many, if not most, ABAP programmers learned their programming and testing skills before the ABAP development environment provided an automated unit testing facility.  \n\nAutomated Unit Testing with ABAP: A Practical Approach offers hope and salvation to ABAP programmers who continue to toil with antiquated manual unit testing processes, taking them by the hand and lifting them out of that dungeon of despair with a modern and proven alternative. It begins by explaining how the xUnit family of automated testing frameworks provides a quick and effective means of insuring high-quality software. It then focuses on the ABAP Unit Testing Facility, the xUnit framework applicable specifically to the ABAP language, showing how it can be used to bring ABAP applications underautomated testing control, from old legacy applications to those newly written.\n\nWhereas xUnit testing has been widely accepted with developers writing in many other programming languages, it is an unfortunate fact in the ABAP community that many programmers still are unfamiliar with xUnit concepts and do not know how to begin implementing automated unit testing into their development process. This book demonstrates how to refactor programs so they become designed for testability, showing how to use process encapsulation and test isolation to facilitate automated testing, including a thorough explanation of test-driven development and the use of test doubles. The book:\n\nShows how to write automated unit tests for ABAP\nInstills ABAP programmers with the confidence to refactor poorly written code\nExplains how an automated testing harness facilitates rapid software development\nTeaches how to utilize test-driven development (TDD) withABAP\nOffers advice and tips on the best ways to write automated unit tests\n\nWhat You Will Learn\n\nBecome familiar with the xUnit approach to testing\nKnow the ABAP statements that interfere with running automated unit tests and how to accommodate them\nUnderstand what it means to isolate code for testing and how this is achieved\nGain the confidence to refactor poorly written code\nMake ABAP programs designed for testability\nReap the benefits of spending less time manually unit testing ABAP programs\nUse test-driven development (TDD) with ABAP programming\nUse configurable test doubles in ABAP\n\nWho This Book Is For\n\nABAP programmers who remain unfamiliar with the automated unit testing facility and those who already use it butwant to improve their skill writing and using automated tests. The book addresses the reluctance and trepidation felt by procedural ABAP programmers who need to know some object-oriented concepts to use this facility, expands their horizons, and helps them step through the doorway leading to a different approach to program design.","tags":["Data","Data Science","Data Science Tasks","A/B Testing"]},{"id":"9780760377307","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Cartooning Made Easy: Circle, Triangle, Square","authors":["Margherita Cole"],"pages":"128","publication_date":"October 2022","description":"Cartooning Made Easy: Circle, Triangle, Square shows you how to use basic shapes to illustrate cute cartoon characters, animals, facial features, objects, and more.","tags":["Design","Visual Design","Film & Video","Animation"]},{"id":"9781627883573","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Art of Cardboard","authors":["Lori Zimmer"],"pages":"160","publication_date":"July 2015","description":"Breathe new life into your art with this incredible new take on a seemingly mundane material.

Current education and practice need to evolve to ensure that the discipline of design meets sustainability drivers and equips students, teachers and professionals for the near-future. New approaches, methods and tools are urgently required as sustainability expands the context for design and what it means to be a 'designer'. Design activists, who comprise a diverse range of designers, teachers and other actors, are setting new ambitions for design. They seek to fundamentally challenge how, where and when design can catalyse positive impacts to address sustainability. They are also challenging who can utilise the power of the design process. To date, examination of contemporary and emergent design activism is poorly represented in the literature. This book will provide a rigorous exploration of design activism that will re-vitalise the design debate and provide a solid platform for students, teachers, design professionals and other disciplines interested in transformative (design) activism.\n\nDesign Activism provides a comprehensive study of contemporary and emergent design activism. This activism has a dual aim - to make positive impacts towards more sustainable ways of living and working; and to challenge and reinvigorate design praxis,. It will collate, synthesise and analyse design activist approaches, processes, methods, tools and inspirational examples/outcomes from disparate sources and, in doing so, will create a specific canon of work to illuminate contemporary design discourse.\n\nDesign Activism reveals the power of design for positive social and environmental change, design with a central activist role in the sustainability challenge. Inspired by past design activists and set against the context of global-local tensions, expressions of design activism are mapped. The nature of contemporary design activism is explored, from individual/collective action to the infrastructure that supports it generating powerful participatory design approaches, a diverse toolbox and inspirational outcomes. This is design as a political and social act, design to enable adaptive societal capacity for co-futuring.","tags":["Design"]},{"id":"9781119152729","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"A Course in Statistics with R","authors":["Prabhanjan N.

How are you supposed to answer that? What does “good” even mean?\n\nWhat if you were equipped to ask better, more specific questions of your work so that you could answer them more directly, and in doing so, bring more specific action and intention to the act of creating photographs? What if asking the right questions allowed you to establish a more helpful and pragmatic approach to your image-making? In The Heart of the Photograph, photographer and author David duChemin helps you learn to ask (and find your own answers to) better questions of your work in order to craft more successful photographs. Photographs that express and connect, photographs that are strong and, above all, yours.\n\nFrom the big-picture questions—What do I want this image to accomplish?—to the more detail-oriented questions that help you get there—What is the light doing? Where do the lines lead?—David walks you through his own questions and process so that you can establish your own. Along the way, there are discussions of the building blocks from which compelling photographs are made, such as gesture, balance, scale, harmony, perspective, story, memory, symbolism, and much more. The Heart of the Photograph is not a theoretical book. It is an immensely practical and truly useful book that empowers you to ask better, more helpful questions of you and your work so that you can produce images that fulfill your vision and intention for them.","tags":["Design","Visual Design","Photography"]},{"id":"9781491975022","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Collaborative Product Design","authors":["Austin Govella"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"May 2019","description":"You can launch a new app or website in days by piecing together frameworks and hosting on AWS.

What if asking the right questions allowed you to establish a more helpful and pragmatic approach to your image-making? In The Heart of the Photograph, photographer and author David duChemin helps you learn to ask (and find your own answers to) better questions of your work in order to craft more successful photographs. Photographs that express and connect, photographs that are strong and, above all, yours.\n\nFrom the big-picture questions—What do I want this image to accomplish?—to the more detail-oriented questions that help you get there—What is the light doing?

Database administrators will be able to make sound architectural decisions in a fast-changing landscape of virtualized servers and container-based solutions based on the empirical method presented in this book for answering “what if” questions about database performance.\nToday’s database administrators face numerous questions such as: \nWhat if we consolidate databases using multitenant features? \nWhat if we virtualize database servers as Docker containers? \nWhat if we deploy the latest in NVMe flash disks to speed up IO access?\nDo features such as compression, partitioning, and in-memory OLTP earn back their price? \nWhat if we move our databases to the cloud?\nAs an administrator, do you know the answers or even how to test the assumptions?\nDatabase Benchmarking and Stress Testing introduces you to database benchmarking using industry-standard test suites such as the TCP series of benchmarks, which are the same benchmarks that vendors rely upon. You’ll learn to run these industry-standard benchmarks and collect results to use in answering questions about the performance impact of architectural changes, technology changes, and even down to the brand of database software. You’ll learn to measure performance and predict the specific impact of changes to your environment. You’ll know the limitations of the benchmarks and the crucial difference between benchmarking and workload capture/reply. \nThis book teaches you how to create empirical evidence in support of business and technology decisions. It’s about not guessing when you should be measuring. Empirical testing is scientific testing that delivers measurable results. Begin with a hypothesis about the impact of a possible architecture or technology change. Then run the appropriate benchmarks to gather data and predict whether the change you’re exploring will be beneficial, and by what order of magnitude. Stop guessing. Start measuring. Let Database Benchmarking and Stress Testing show the way.\nWhat You'll Learn\nUnderstand the industry-standard database benchmarks, and when each is best used\nPrepare for a database benchmarking effort so reliable results can be achieved\nPerform database benchmarking for consolidation, virtualization, and cloud projects\nRecognize and avoid common mistakes in benchmarking database performance\nMeasure and interpret results in a rational, concise manner for reliable comparisons\nChoose and provide advice on benchmarking tools based on their pros and cons\nWho This Book Is For\nDatabase administrators and professionals responsible for advising on architectural decisions such as whether to use cloud-based services, whether to consolidate and containerize, and who must make recommendations on storage or any other technology that impacts database performance","tags":["Data","Data Engineering","Database Architecture"]},{"id":"9781484265970","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Immersive 3D Design Visualization: With Autodesk Maya and Unreal Engine 4","authors":["Abhishek Kumar"],"pages":"302","publication_date":"December 2020","description":"Discover the methods and techniques required for creating immersive design visualization for industry.

And yet, while many leaders and managers recognize the threat from digital--and the potential opportunity--they lack a common language and compelling framework to help them assess it and guide them in responding. They don't know how to think about their digital business model.\n\nIn this concise, practical book, MIT digital research leaders Peter Weill and Stephanie Woerner provide a powerful yet straightforward framework that has been field-tested globally with dozens of senior management teams.

Looking at these dimensions in combination results in four distinct business models, each with different capabilities. The book then sets out six driving questions, in separate chapters, that help managers and executives clarify where they are currently in an increasingly digital business landscape and highlight what's needed to move toward a higher-value digital business model.\n\nFilled with straightforward self-assessments, motivating examples, and sharp financial analyses of where profits are made, this smart book will help you tackle the threats, leverage the opportunities, and create winning digital strategies.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Digital Transformation"]},{"id":"9781784391904","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Java Hibernate Cookbook","authors":["Yogesh Prajapati","Vishal Ranapariya"],"pages":"250","publication_date":"September 2015","description":"Learn how to use Hibernate, a powerful Java object-relational mapping framework, with the \"Java Hibernate Cookbook.\" This book is designed to help developers quickly grasp the capabilities of Hibernate, taking you from installation to building real-world applications.\n\nWhat this Book will help me do\n\nInstall and configure Hibernate for Java development.\nUtilize annotations to streamline Hibernate configuration.\nImplement collection mappings such as lists, maps, and sets.\nUnderstand and create associations between different entities.\nIntegrate Hibernate with other frameworks to develop enterprise solutions.\n\nAuthor(s)\n\nNone Prajapati and None Ranapariya are experienced Java developers and authors with a passion for sharing knowledge about cutting-edge frameworks and tools.

Focusing on contemporary picturebooks, Sandra Beckett shows that the picturebook has traditionally been seen as a children’s genre, but in the eyes of many authors, illustrators, and publishers, it is a narrative form that can address any and all age groups. Innovative graphics and formats as well as the creative, often complex dialogue between text and image provide multiple levels of meaning and invite readers of all ages to consider texts that are primarily marketed as children’s books. The interplay of text and image that distinguishes the picturebook from other forms of fiction and makes it a unique art form also makes it the ultimate crossover genre. Crossover picturebooks are often very complex texts that are challenging for adults as well as children. Many are characterized by difficult \"adult\" themes, genre blending, metafictive discourse, intertextuality, sophisticated graphics, and complex text-image interplay. Exciting experiments with new formats and techniques, as well as novel interactions with new media and technologies have made the picturebook one of the most vibrant and innovative contemporary literary genres, one that seems to know no boundaries. Crossover Picturebooks is a valuable addition to the study of a genre that is gaining increasing recognition and appreciation, and contributes significantly to the field of children’s literature as a whole.","tags":["Design","Visual Design","Illustration"]},{"id":"9781317309338","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Photography Handbook, 3rd Edition","authors":["Terence Wright"],"pages":"292","publication_date":"January 2016","description":"The new edition of The Photography Handbook builds on previous editions’ illuminating overview of the history, theory and practice of the creation and consumption of photographic images, and engages with the practical and theoretical implications of the explosion of new platforms for making, viewing and distributing images.\n\nNew materials in this edition includes new chapters on ‘Photo-elicitation’ and ‘Photography and Technological Change’, exploration and analysis of ‘selfie’ culture, and extensive discussion of the work and practices by a new generation photographic artists.\n\nThe Photography Handbook, Third edition also features:\n\nexploration and discussion of key photographic terms, including composition, framing, visualisation, formalism and realism\nanalysis of the ethics of photojournalism, and ethical issues specific to digital photography practice today\ncase studies illustrating different photographic production practices and specific related issues, including an assignment for the Guardian, the Libyan People’s Bureau siege, and the work of war photographers\na foregrounding of digital photographic practices, and exploration of areas including photographic manipulation, digital photojournalism, citizen journalists and copyright on the internet\nend of chapter summaries of key points, and an extensive glossary of essential photography terms.\n\nThe Photography Handbook, Third edition is an invaluable resource for students, scholars and practitioners of photography, and all those seeking to understand its place in today’s society.","tags":["Design","Visual Design","Photography"]},{"id":"9781492018780","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"The Dramatic Portrait, 1st Edition","authors":["Chris Knight"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"April 2017","description":"Without light, there is no photograph. As almost every photographer knows, the word “photograph” has its roots in two Greek words that, together, mean “drawing with light.” But what is less commonly acknowledged and understood is the role that shadow plays in creating striking, expressive imagery, especially in portraiture. It is through deft, nuanced use of both light and shadow that you can move beyond shooting simply ordinary, competent headshots into the realm of creating dramatic portraiture that can so powerfully convey a subject’s inner essence, communicate a personal narrative, and express your photographic vision.\n\nIn The Dramatic Portrait: The Art of Crafting Light and Shadow, Chris Knight addresses portraiture with a unique approach to both light and shadow that allows you to improve and elevate your own portraiture. He begins with the history of portraiture, from the early work of Egyptians and Greeks to the sublime treatment of light and subject by artists such as Caravaggio, Rembrandt, and Vermeer. Chris then dives into a deep, hands-on exploration of light, shadow, and portraiture, offering numerous lessons and takeaways. He covers:\n• The qualities of light: hard, soft, and the spectrum in between\n• The relationships between light, subject, and background, and how to control them\n• Lighting patterns such as Paramount, Rembrandt, loop, and split\n• Lighting ratios and how they affect contrast in your image\n• Equipment: from big and small modifiers to grids, snoots, barn doors, flags, and gels\n• Multiple setups for portrait shoots, including those that utilize one, two, and three lights\n• How color contributes to drama and mood, eliciting an emotional response from the viewer\n• How to approach styling your portrait, from wardrobe to background\n• The post-processing workflow, including developing the RAW file, maximizing contrast, color grading, retouching, and dodging and burning for heightened drama and effect\n• How all of these elements culminate to help you define your personal style and create your own narrative","tags":["Design","Visual Design","Photography"]},{"id":"9781457189319","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"One Flash!","authors":["Tilo Gockel"],"pages":"232","publication_date":"July 2015","description":"Amazing images are possible with just one flash!

Coined by Paul Otlet in 1934 in his Traite de Documentation, \"hyperdocumentation\" refers to the concept of documentation that is constantly being expanded and extended in its functionalities and prerogatives.While, according to Otlet, everything could potentially be documented in this way, increasingly we find that it is our lives that are being hyperdocumented. Hyperdocumentation manifests as an increase not only in the quantity of information that is processed but also in its scope, as information is progressively integrated across areas that were previously poorly documented or even undocumented.","tags":["Software Development","Coding Practices","Documentation"]},{"id":"9781785280252","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Introduction to R for Business Intelligence","authors":["Jay Gendron"],"pages":"228","publication_date":"August 2016","description":"Master the essentials of using R for Business Intelligence in this practical guide.

Beckett"],"pages":"398","publication_date":"June 2013","description":"This book situates the picturebook genre within the widespread international phenomenon of crossover literature, examining an international corpus of picturebooks — including artists’ books, wordless picturebooks, and celebrity picturebooks — that appeal to readers of all ages. Focusing on contemporary picturebooks, Sandra Beckett shows that the picturebook has traditionally been seen as a children’s genre, but in the eyes of many authors, illustrators, and publishers, it is a narrative form that can address any and all age groups. Innovative graphics and formats as well as the creative, often complex dialogue between text and image provide multiple levels of meaning and invite readers of all ages to consider texts that are primarily marketed as children’s books. The interplay of text and image that distinguishes the picturebook from other forms of fiction and makes it a unique art form also makes it the ultimate crossover genre. Crossover picturebooks are often very complex texts that are challenging for adults as well as children. Many are characterized by difficult \"adult\" themes, genre blending, metafictive discourse, intertextuality, sophisticated graphics, and complex text-image interplay. Exciting experiments with new formats and techniques, as well as novel interactions with new media and technologies have made the picturebook one of the most vibrant and innovative contemporary literary genres, one that seems to know no boundaries. Crossover Picturebooks is a valuable addition to the study of a genre that is gaining increasing recognition and appreciation, and contributes significantly to the field of children’s literature as a whole.","tags":["Design","Visual Design","Illustration"]},{"id":"9781317309338","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Photography Handbook, 3rd Edition","authors":["Terence Wright"],"pages":"292","publication_date":"January 2016","description":"The new edition of The Photography Handbook builds on previous editions’ illuminating overview of the history, theory and practice of the creation and consumption of photographic images, and engages with the practical and theoretical implications of the explosion of new platforms for making, viewing and distributing images.\n\nNew materials in this edition includes new chapters on ‘Photo-elicitation’ and ‘Photography and Technological Change’, exploration and analysis of ‘selfie’ culture, and extensive discussion of the work and practices by a new generation photographic artists.\n\nThe Photography Handbook, Third edition also features:\n\nexploration and discussion of key photographic terms, including composition, framing, visualisation, formalism and realism\nanalysis of the ethics of photojournalism, and ethical issues specific to digital photography practice today\ncase studies illustrating different photographic production practices and specific related issues, including an assignment for the Guardian, the Libyan People’s Bureau siege, and the work of war photographers\na foregrounding of digital photographic practices, and exploration of areas including photographic manipulation, digital photojournalism, citizen journalists and copyright on the internet\nend of chapter summaries of key points, and an extensive glossary of essential photography terms.\n\nThe Photography Handbook, Third edition is an invaluable resource for students, scholars and practitioners of photography, and all those seeking to understand its place in today’s society.","tags":["Design","Visual Design","Photography"]},{"id":"9781119747116","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Building a Digital Future","authors":["Lipi Sarkar","Vinnie Bansal"],"pages":"336","publication_date":"May 2021","description":"The dramatic events of 2020 have clarified the urgent need for digital transformation in countless organizations.\n\nThe rise of remote work and the rapidly increasing use of cloud technologies are just two drivers of the relentless pace of digital disruption.

The three-dimensional perspective focuses on the changes in the marketplace for flat steel sheets, the responsiveness and sensitivity to these market changes, and applying the best available technology to obtain a high quality product. Prior to this study, technology transfer has been examined in a bivariate relationship, namely, how technology transfer contributed to the development process in developing countries and Newly Industrialized Countries (NICs).\n\nThe framework formulated in this study showed that Japan was lagging behind all the steel-producing countries because, like the NICs, it imported the physical and organizational technologies that fostered its prosperity. Based on primary and secondary research, this study revealed that high levels of operational efficiency and sophisticated product quality were achieved through continuous improvement culminating in Computer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM) consisting of Real Time Process Control.

During this period, a small group of sound professionals in Hollywood wrote and published a critical journal about the craftsmanship, new technology, and changing aesthetics that excited conversation in their community. Their work has been edited and compiled here for the first time.\n\nDavid Stone is a sound editor, a veteran of roughly 100 Hollywood feature films, such as Gremlins, Top Gun, Die Hard, Speed, and Ocean’s 11. He was a Supervising Sound Editor for projects as varied as Predator, Edward Scissorhands, Beauty and the Beast, Batman Returns, City Slickers 2, and Dolores Claiborne. He has collected Golden Reel awards for Best Sound Editing five times, and won the 1992 Academy Award® for best Sound Effects Editing, for his supervising work on Bram Stoker’s Dracula. In 2015, he received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the San Luis Obispo Jewish Film Festival in California. Stone is now a Professor and former Chair of Sound Design at Savannah College of Art and Design. Between 1989 and 1994, he was the editor of Moviesound Newsletter, which was published by Vanessa Ament.\n\nDr. Vanessa Theme Ament is the author of The Foley Grail, and a contributor to Sound: Dialogue, Music, and Effects (the Silver Screen Series). She is on the steering committee for Cinesonika, an international film festival and conference. A veteran Foley artist, sound editor, and voice actor from Los Angeles, she also writes and sings jazz, and is a member of the American Federation of Musicians, SAG-AFTRA, Actors Equity, and the Editors Guild.

These methods embrace change in requirements even late in the project. The ability to change software is because of certain practices that are followed within teams, such as Test Driven Development, Pair Programming, and Continuous Integration. Continuous Integration provides a way for software teams to integrate their work more than once a day, and promotes confidence in the software that is being developed by the team. It is thought that this practice is difficult to apply when continuously integrating the database with application code; hence, Evolutionary Database Development is considered a mismatch with agile methods. Pramod Sadalage shows that this is not necessarily true.\n\nContinuous Integration changed the way software is written. Why not extend and make the database part of the same Continuous Integration cycle so that you can see integrated results of your application as well as your database?

Ward","Dantar P. Oosterwal","Durward K. Sobek II"],"pages":"116","publication_date":"April 2018","description":"This book describes what could be termed n 'engineering development secret' -- the creation and application of visible knowledge to propel effective product development. Visible knowledge is a tool nearly lost in the West, but it has been used to great effect by Toyota in its 50 year march from non-competitiveness to its current status as the preeminent global automobile company.\n\nVisible Knowledge for Flawless Design presents the reader with a systematic approach to create, capture, and display knowledge in a way that allows development teams to optimize the design of their products and production processes. Visible knowledge not only applies to knowledge management, but also provides a means of collaboration to facilitate better decision-making in the development process. The book provides a brief history and background of the technique, then takes the reader through example problems in a step-by-step workbook style that facilitates practice and application. It concludes with suggestions on implementation in the reader’s work environment.\n\nDr. Allen Ward is the patriarch of Lean Product Development. His efforts led to the rediscovery of Visible Knowledge and the recognition of its importance in the development of new manufactured products. Allen was driven by a desire to test his hypothesis that the optimal design would be achieved through a 'design compiler' that would simultaneously evaluate all design variables to maximize the overall benefit for the customer. Or more simply put, if all of the data and trade-offs to a design were defined in advance, then simultaneously evaluating the design factors would lead developers to the optimal design solution.\n\nDr. Ward set out to study design processes in industry to understand how companies evaluated design parameters to optimize their designs. He discovered only one company in which developers methodically created knowledge, evaluated parameters in advance of making design decisions according to his hypothesis for optimal design, and reused that knowledge in subsequent design cycles. This company was Toyota and the development system employed there was multiple times more effective and efficient than anything else he found in his research. Dr. Ward referred to the technique he uncovered as 'visible knowledge.' By carefully understanding the relationships between design parameters and product performance, then creating visible representations of those relationships, new knowledge is generated in such a way that engineering comparisons can be made quickly and efficiently resulting in faster decision-making with less design iteration. The general form of the solutions can then be stored and applied on all future problems that fit the form, greatly extending the development capability of the development team. Dr. Ward wrote a manuscript to describe visible knowledge, but tragically passed away before it was ever published. Visible Knowledge for Flawless Design is the completion of that manuscript. It has been corrected and compiled for publication in an effort to keep it as close as possible to the original manuscript, but updated and augmented in key areas to keep the text current and provide additional insight and examples.","tags":["Design","Product Design"]},{"id":"9780124080805","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Accelerating MATLAB with GPU Computing","authors":["Jung W.

You will learn how to gather data effectively, and also how to understand the philosophy and implementation of each type of chart, so as to be able to represent the results visually.\n\nWith the popularity of the R language, the art and practice of creating data visualizations is no longer the preserve of mathematicians, statisticians, or cartographers. As technology leaders, we can gather metrics around what we do and use data visualizations to communicate that information. Pro Data Visualization Using R and JavaScript combines the power of the R language with the simplicity and familiarity of JavaScript to display clear and informative data visualizations.\n\nGathering and analyzing empirical data is the key to truly understanding anything. We can track operational metrics to quantify the health of our products in production. We can track quality metrics of our projects, and even use our data to identify bad code. Visualizing this data allows anyone to read our analysis and easily get a deep understanding of the story the data tells.

Some design choices can lead to wrong conclusions or mistaken impressions. Graphic software relies on defaults to deliver something if you make a minimal effort, but that something is not likely to be exactly what you want.\n\nVisual Data Insights Using SAS ODS Graphics provides examples using experience-based design principles. It presents examples of bar charts, pie charts, and trend lines or time series plots, the graph types commonly used in business, other organizations, and the media for visual insight into data. Newer graphs are also included: dot plots, needle plots, waterfall charts, butterflycharts, heat maps, bubble plots, step plots, high-low plots, and donut charts. In addition, there are basic tools of statistics: scatter plots, box plots, histograms, fit and confidence plots, and distributions.\n\nAuthor LeRoy Bessler introduces unique creations, including sparsely annotated time series, maximally informative bar charts, better box plots, histograms based on interesting atypical rationales, and much more.\n\nThe examples use SAS sample data sets as input. Any SAS user can experiment with the code presented to see what else is possible, or adapt it to repurpose the design and apply it with a customized version of that code.\n\nWhat You’ll Learn\n\nCreate graphs that are easily and quickly interpreted, and without ambiguity\nSupply precise data values that are correct on the graph and correctly associated with the graphic visual elements\nTake advantage of widely applicable (but not necessarily available elsewhere) design examples\nAvoid bad practices that are encouraged by poor examples elsewhere\nGet past sub-optimal designs and results that are built into software defaults\nTake advantage of less familiar capabilities available in the software\n\nWho This Book Is For\n\nSAS software users who want to understand their data and/or visually deliver their results","tags":["Data","Data Science","Data Science Tasks","Data Visualization"]},{"id":"9781484239674","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Data Professionals at Work","authors":["Malathi Mahadevan"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"October 2018","description":"Enjoy reading interviews with more than two dozen data professionals to see a picture of what it’s like to work in the industry managing and analyzing data, helping you to know what it takes to move from your current expertise into one of the fastest growing areas of technology today.

And in addition to knowing how to use your flash, you need to know which modifiers and triggers you might need, and you need to learn use them quickly.That’s why this book was created: to quickly get you to the technique, the setting, or exactly the right thing you need to do right now to improve your work.Here’s how it works: When you need to know how to do a particular thing, you turn to the chapter where it would be found, find the thing you need to do (it’s easy, each page covers just one single topic), and Scott tells you exactly how to do it just like he was sitting there beside you, using the same casual style as if he were telling a friend. That way, you get back to shooting fast.This isn’t a book of theory, full of confusing jargon and complicated concepts. This is a book on which settings to use, and exactly how and when to use them. The whole book is written in Scott’s plain-English, down-to-earth style, which makes the experience more like the two of you are out together on a shoot.\n\nIt’s time to fall truly head-over-heels in love with your flash, so you can start creating the type of images with your flash that you’ve always dreamed of, and this is the book that can take you there.","tags":["Design","Visual Design","Photography"]},{"id":"9781681987811","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Mastering Color Mixing with Watercolors","authors":["Isabelle Roelofs","Fabien Petillion"],"pages":"144","publication_date":"April 2021","description":"Learn to create any color from a basic palette of just 11 colors!\n\nWhat if you could create any color you wanted, from a basic palette of just 11 colors?

Your options will be limited only by your imagination.\n\nIn this color mixing book, Isabelle Roelofs and Fabien Petillion first walk you step by step through the basics of watercolor pigments, paper, and color mixing techniques. Using just 11 colors, you’ll learn to bring more variety to your primary colors, create basic colors (such as Payne’s Gray and Van Dyck Brown), and create your own secondary colors. This approach works no matter what brand of paints you use, as each of the 11 colors is identified by its universal pigment color (such as PY154).\n\nOnce you’re underway color mixing, you’ll see how four artists interpret that basic palette to create thematic color palettes tailored to different subject matter, such as flowers, landscapes, portraits, and animals. Finally, you’ll solidify your understanding of color mixing by analyzing five watercolor paintings to see how the color was achieved and how the painting was developed, layer by layer, to achieve the final result.","tags":["Design","Visual Design","Graphic Design","Color"]},{"id":"9781592532391","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"1,000 Icons, Symbols, and Pictograms","authors":["Blackcoffee Design"],"pages":"320","publication_date":"September 2006","description":"A catalog of 1,000 symbol and icon designs in an affordable format.","tags":["Design","Visual Design","Graphic Design"]},{"id":"9780240811086","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Sound, Lighting and Video: A Resource for Worship","authors":["Brad Herring"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"September 2012","description":"Lights, Camera,Worship! is a manual for all of your technical needs.

The ability to interchange text, audio, and visual communication over the Internet has fundamentally transformed the way news organizations operate. Convergence has enabled media companies to gather, disseminate, and share information over a variety of platforms. Throughout the history of journalism, it has been common for journalists to study one medium, such as traditional print or broadcast, and to anticipate a career working only in their chosen field. However, the 21st century journalist has fluidity to write and deliver news content in a variety of formats. (source: http://www.convergencejournalism.com/)\n\n\nBroadcast News Writing, Reporting, and Producing presents a solid foundation for any student learning how to become a broadcast journalist ? in today's world of convergent journalism, it is more important than ever that broadcast textbooks cover the most current trends in media. Convergent journalism (the coverage of news across multiple delivery platforms such as the internet, television, podcasts, ipods, blogs, etc) is here to stay ? broadcast journalism continues to morph as newer and more advanced content platforms are hatched and developed, and broadcast journalists must understand how to write, report, and produce for multiple platforms simultaneously. Just one crucial fact remains: students will need training on how to perform successfully in a world in which current events aren't just shown on the ten o'clock evening news.\n\nBroadcast News Writing, Reporting, and Producing will be completely overhauled to reflect the trends of convergent journalism on every page. New co-author Frank Barnas brings a multi-faceted perspective of writing, reporting, and producing that allows for multi-platform delivery systems, and shows students with real-world examples the functions and practices of today's media. The new edition will be rewritten and restructured to accommodate common 16-week course modules, and will be divided into four major sections of the news: gathering, writing, reporting, and producing. Sidebars featuring how examples used in the text relate to convergence in journalism help students to draw connections easily between current stories and trends in the industry.\n\nThe comprehensive approach of this text brings a multi-faceted perspective of writing, reporting, and producing that is needed more than ever in today's world of convergent journalism. This newest edition is being completely overhauled by the experienced journalist Frank Barnas. New photos and illustrations, a restructuring of the text, expanded end-of-chapter exercises, newer and more relevant examples, and more information on producing all contribute to giving readers what they need most: a nuanced understanding of how the media of today function in a world without news boundaries.","tags":["Design","Visual Design","Film & Video","Television Production"]},{"id":"9780134429168","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Time Lapse Photography, Long Exposure & Other Tricks of Time: From Snapshots to Great Shots, First Edition","authors":["John Carucci"],"pages":"224","publication_date":"February 2016","description":"In the newest entry in Peachpit's popular From Snapshots to Great Shots series, photographer John Carucci shares amazing techniques for creative time-related photography techniques, including long-exposure, time-lapse, and high-speed photography.\n\nCarucci starts by reviewing your equipment needs, including filters, image stabilizers (tripods, monopods, beanbags, etc.), software, and more.

The text contains real-life applications of some multidimensional aggregations (most of which have been designed by international organizations such as the United Nations\n\nDevelopment Program and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development) that help to judge the performance of a country in the various dimensions of well-being.\n\nThe text offers an evaluation of how well a society is doing with respect to achievements of all the individuals in the dimensions considered and clearly investigates how achievements in the dimensions can be evaluated from different perspectives. The author includes a detailed scrutiny of alternative techniques for setting weights to individual dimensional metrics and offers an extensive analysis into both the descriptive and welfare theoretical approaches to the concerned multi-attribute measurement and related issues. This important resource:\n\n• Contains a synthesis of multidimensional welfare, inequality, poverty, and vulnerability analysis\n\n• Examines aggregations of achievement levels in the concerned dimensions of well-being from various standpoints\n\n• Shows how to measure poverty using panel data instead of restricting attention to a single period and when we have imprecise information on dimensional achievements\n\n• Argues that multidimensional analysis is intrinsically different from marginal distributions-based analysis\n\nWritten for students, teachers, researchers, and scholars, Analyzing Multidimensional Well-Being: A Quantitative Approach puts the focus on various approaches to the measurementof the many aspects of well-being and quality of life.\n\nSatya R.

It is a thorough reference to the 3GPP and MPEG Parametric Stereo standards and the MPEG Surround multi-channel audio coding standard. It describes key developments in coding techniques, which is an important factor in the optimization of advanced entertainment, communications and signal processing applications.\n\nUntil recently, technologies for coding audio signals, such as redundancy reduction and sophisticated source and receiver models did not incorporate spatial characteristics of source and receiving ends. Spatial audio coding achieves much higher compression ratios than conventional coders. It does this by representing multi-channel audio signals as a downmix signal plus side information that describes the perceptually-relevant spatial information.\n\nWritten by experts in spatial audio coding, Spatial Audio Processing:\n\nreviews psychoacoustics (the relationship between physical measures of sound and the corresponding percepts) and spatial audio sound formats and reproduction systems;\n\nbrings together the processing, acquisition, mixing, playback, and perception of spatial audio, with the latest coding techniques;\n\nanalyses algorithms for the efficient manipulation of multiple, discrete and combined spatial audio channels, including both MP3 and MPEG Surround;\n\nshows how the same insights on source and receiver models can also be applied for manipulation of audio signals, such as the synthesis of virtual auditory scenes employing head-related transfer function (HRTF) processing and stereo to N-channel audio upmix.\n\nAudio processing research engineers and audio coding research and implementation engineers will find this an insightful guide.

It will be of particular interest to bioinformaticians with an interest in immunology, as well as to immunologists, and other biologists who need to understand how advances in theoretical and computational immunobiology can transform their working practices.","tags":["Data","Data Science","Data Science Domains","Bioinformatics"]},{"id":"9780135447260","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Learn Adobe After Effects CC for Visual Effects and Motion Graphics, First Edition","authors":["Conrad Chavez","Joe Dockery"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"April 2019","description":"Motion graphics are no longer just for movie and television screens.

Do you have a system for assigning and tracking content data on your photos? If you make a living as a photographer, do your images bear your copyright and contact information, or do they circulate in the marketplace unprotected?\n\nAs professional photographer and author Peter Krogh sees it, \"your DAM system is fundamental to the way your images are known, both to you and to everyone else.\" DAM, or Digital Asset Management, in the world of digital photography refers to every part of the process that follows the taking of the picture, through final output and permanent storage. Anyone who shoots, scans or stores digital photographs, is practicing some form of digital asset management. Unfortunately, most of us don't yet know how to manage our files (and our time) very systematically, or efficiently.\n\nIn The DAM Book: Digital Asset Management for Photographers, Krogh brings clarity to the often overwhelming task of managing digital photographs, with a solid plan and practical advice for fellow photographers on how to file, find, protect and re-use photographs. Following a thorough overview of the DAM system and de-mystifications of metadata and digital archiving, Krogh focuses on best practices for digital photographers using Adobe Photoshop CS2. He explains how to use Adobe Bridge, the new CS2 navigational software that replaces the File Browser introduced in Photoshop 7, with full details on integrating Bridge, Camera Raw and Digital Asset Management software.\n\nCompellingly presented in four-color format, The DAM Book: Digital Asset Management for Photographers brings Krogh's award-winning creative approach to a subject that could have been technically intimidating. Instead, Krogh's twenty years of experience and instructive visual storytelling make this material not only accessible, but compulsory reading for serious digital photographers.","tags":["Design","Visual Design","Film & Video","Digital Asset Management"]},{"id":"9781118456033","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Nonparametric Statistical Process Control","authors":["Subhabrata Chakraborti","Marien Graham"],"pages":"448","publication_date":"April 2019","description":"A unique approach to understanding the foundations of statistical quality control with a focus on the latest developments in nonparametric control charting methodologies\n\nStatistical Process Control (SPC) methods have a long and successful history and have revolutionized many facets of industrial production around the world. This book addresses recent developments in statistical process control bringing the modern use of computers and simulations along with theory within the reach of both the researchers and practitioners. The emphasis is on the burgeoning field of nonparametric SPC (NSPC) and the many new methodologies developed by researchers worldwide that are revolutionizing SPC.\n\nOver the last several years research in SPC, particularly on control charts, has seen phenomenal growth. Control charts are no longer confined to manufacturing and are now applied for process control and monitoring in a wide array of applications, from education, to environmental monitoring, to disease mapping, to crime prevention. This book addresses quality control methodology, especially control charts, from a statistician’s viewpoint, striking a careful balance between theory and practice. Although the focus is on the newer nonparametric control charts, the reader is first introduced to the main classes of the parametric control charts and the associated theory, so that the proper foundational background can be laid. \n\nReviews basic SPC theory and terminology, the different types of control charts, control chart design, sample size, sampling frequency, control limits, and more\nFocuses on the distribution-free (nonparametric) charts for the cases in which the underlying process distribution is unknown\nProvides guidance on control chart selection, choosing control limits and other quality related matters, along with all relevant formulas and tables\nUses computer simulations and graphics to illustrate concepts and explore the latest research in SPC\n\nOffering a uniquely balanced presentation of both theory and practice, Nonparametric Methods for Statistical Quality Control is a vital resource for students, interested practitioners, researchers, and anyone with an appropriate background in statistics interested in learning about the foundations of SPC and latest developments in NSPC.","tags":["Data","Data Science","Data Science Tasks","Statistics"]},{"id":"9781491978337","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Improve your data quality using sampling distribution","authors":["Andrew Bruce","Peter Bruce"],"pages":"11","publication_date":"December 2016","description":"Statistical methods are central to the techniques involved in capturing value from data.

A common example can be seen during any televised football game, in which information about the game is digitally overlaid on the field as the players move and position themselves. Another application is Google Glass, which enables users to see AR graphics and information about their location and surroundings on the lenses of their \"digital eyewear\", changing in real-time as they move about.\n\nAugmented Reality Law, Privacy, and Ethics is the first book to examine the social, legal, and ethical issues surrounding AR technology. Digital eyewear products have very recently thrust this rapidly-expanding field into the mainstream, but the technology is so much more than those devices. Industry analysts have dubbed AR the \"eighth mass medium\" of communications. Science fiction movies have shown us the promise of this technology for decades, and now our capabilities are finally catching up to that vision.\n\nAugmented Reality will influence society as fundamentally as the Internet itself has done, and such a powerful medium cannot help but radically affect the laws and norms that govern society. No author is as uniquely qualified to provide a big-picture forecast and guidebook for these developments as Brian Wassom. A practicing attorney, he has been writing on AR law since 2007 and has established himself as the world's foremost thought leader on the intersection of law, ethics, privacy, and AR. Augmented Reality professionals around the world follow his Augmented Legality® blog. This book collects and expands upon the best ideas expressed in that blog, and sets them in the context of a big-picture forecast of how AR is shaping all aspects of society.\n\nAugmented reality thought-leader Brian Wassom provides you with insight into how AR is changing our world socially, ethically, and legally.\nIncludes current examples, case studies, and legal cases from the frontiers of AR technology.\nLearn how AR is changing our world in the areas of civil rights, privacy, litigation, courtroom procedure, addition, pornography, criminal activity, patent, copyright, and free speech.\nAn invaluable reference guide to the impacts of this cutting-edge technology for anyone who is developing apps for it, using it, or affected by it in daily life.","tags":["Data","Data Engineering","Data Security & Privacy"]},{"id":"9780132835985","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"CS5.5 Update: Adobe After Effects CS5 Classroom In a Book","authors":["Adobe Creative Team"],"pages":"1","publication_date":"June 2011","description":"This Creative Suite 5.5 update includes coverage of the latest features in Adobe After Effects CS5.5","tags":["Design","Design Tools","Adobe Design Tools","Adobe After Effects"]},{"id":"9780321683953","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Adobe Photoshop Elements 8 Classroom in a Book","authors":["Adobe Creative Team"],"pages":"448","publication_date":"December 2009","description":"Adobe Photoshop Elements 8 Classroom in a Book is the most thorough and comprehensive way for you to master all the new features in Adobe's consumer-targeted image editing software.

This utility used a form named Data Description Specifications (DDS) to define the database physical (PF) and logical (LF) files (base tables, views, and indexes).\n\nIn 1988, IBM announced the AS/400. The OS/400 operating system also contained a built-in RDMS, however, IBM offered Structured Query Language (SQL) as an alternative to DDS for creating databases.

It presents techniques, tricks, and solutions for dealing with badly shot elements, coloration artifacts, and mismatched lighting that bedevil actual compositors working on real shots. Readers are offered in-depth practical methods for matte extraction, despill procedures, compositing operations, and color correction--the \"meat and potatoes\" of all digital effects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompositing is the artistic blending of several disparate elements from a variety of sources into a single image while making all the component elements appear to be in the same light space and shot with the same camera. When confronted with a bad composite any observer will recognize that something is wrong--the artist will know what is causing the problem, and the technician will know how to fix it. A good compositor must be both an artist and a technician.\n\nWritten by a senior compositor with over ten years' experience in both feature film and broadcast television, this book offers a broad range of alternative solutions that will save hours of fiddling with composites trying to get them to look right when the basic tools aren't working.

It's even more of that \"Ah ha, so that' s how they do it,\" straight-to-the-point, skip-the-techno-jargon stuff people can really use today, and that made volume 1 the world's best-selling book on digital photography. This book truly has a brilliant premise, and here's how Scott describes it: \"If you and I were out on a shoot and you asked me, 'Hey Scott, I want the light for this portrait to look really soft and flattering. How far back should I put this softbox?' I wouldn't give you a lecture about lighting ratios, or flash modifiers. In real life, I'd just turn to you and say, 'Move it in as close to your subject as you possibly can, without it actually showing up in the shot.' Well, that's what this book is all about: you and I out shooting where I answer questions, give you advice, and share the secrets I've learned, just like I would with a friend--without all the technical explanations and techie photo speak.\" Each page covers a single concept on how to make your photography better. Every time you turn the page, you'll learn another pro setting, tool, or trick to transform your work from snapshots into gallery prints. If you're tired of taking shots that look \"okay,\" and if you're tired of looking in photography magazines and thinking, \"Why don't my shots look like that?\" then this is the book for you. This isn't a book of theory, full of confusing jargon and detailed concepts. This is a book on which button to push, which setting to use, and when to use it. With another 200 of the most closely guarded photographic \"tricks of the trade,\" this book gets you shooting dramatically better-looking, sharper, more colorful, more professional-looking photos every time.","tags":["Design","Visual Design","Photography"]},{"id":"0321410971","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Transcending CSS: The Fine Art of Web Design","authors":["Andy Clarke","Molly E.

This book introduces the rising trend of SoLoMo consumers who embrace an omnichannel marketing approach. Consumers are rapidly moving between channels and platforms, which is why marketers are finding it so difficult to implement an integrated marketing strategy. Today’s consumers can check into a store with the use of a geolocation service (Foursquare), redeem an offer that is available, and share their comment on that platform. Then immediately they can post an update on their Facebook timeline, referencing the retailer’s page. SoLoMo consumers have three basic characteristics: SOcial media engagement, LOcal findability, and smartphone MObility. The authors conceptualize this new marketing approach, and provide examples to illustrate the case. The SoLoMo phenomenon has completely changed the way marketers need to operate their campaigns, from the way they conceive of their relationship with the customer to the way they design and operate campaigns.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Marketing","Digital Marketing"]},{"id":"9781606499412","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Fostering Brand Community Through Social Media","authors":["William F.

Companies such as Geico, Dell and eBay are adapting the traditional “one-way” advertising message and using it as a stepping-stone to begin a two-way dialogue with consumers via social media.\n\nMarketers know that theoretically, social media should be a powerful way to generate sustainable, positive word-of-mouth marketing. If marketers can only select the right social media platform, design the right message and engage the right users to spread that message, their campaign should be a success. But until now, that’s been a big if.\n\nThe authors propose a seven-step framework for success in social media marketing campaigns. Their framework involves identifying social media users who are not only influential but also particularly interested in the company’s product or service category and then recruiting and incentivizing those influencers to talk about the company’s product or service. The authors describe the implementation of their seven-step framework at Hokey Pokey Ice Cream Creations, an upscale ice-cream retailer with more than a dozen outlets across India. Hokey Pokey’s social media campaign resulted in substantial increases in brand awareness, social media ROI and sales revenue growth rate for the company. The authors also explain three new metrics they developed for use in social media marketing campaigns: the Customer Influence Effect, which measures the influence a social media user has on other users in the network; the Stickiness Index, which helps identify social media users who actively discuss the company’s product or service category; and Customer Influence Value, which helps measure the monetary gain or loss realized by a company in social marketing campaigns by accounting for an individual’s influence on purchases by other customers and prospects.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Marketing","Digital Marketing","Social Media Marketing"]},{"id":"9780134434964","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Domain-Driven Design Distilled, 1/e","authors":["Vaughn Vernon"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"May 2016","description":"Domain-Driven Design (DDD) software modeling delivers powerful results in practice, not just in theory, which is why developers worldwide are rapidly moving to adopt it.

Gilbert"],"pages":"292","publication_date":"December 2019","description":"What is inclusive design? It is simple. It means that your product has been created with the intention of being accessible to as many different users as possible. For a long time, the concept of accessibility has been limited in terms of only defining physical spaces. However, change is afoot: personal technology now plays a part in the everyday lives of most of us, and thus it is a responsibility for designers of apps, web pages, and more public-facing tech products to make them accessible to all. Our digital era brings progressive ideas and paradigm shifts – but they are only truly progressive if everybody can participate.\nIn Inclusive Design for a Digital World, multiple crucial aspects of technological accessibility are confronted, followed by step-by-step solutions from User Experience Design professor and author Regine Gilbert. Think about every potential user who could be using your product. Could they be visually impaired? Have limited motor skills? Be deaf or hard of hearing? This book addresses a plethora of web accessibility issues that people with disabilities face. Your app might be blocking out an entire sector of the population without you ever intending or realizing it. For example, is your instructional text full of animated words and Emoji icons? This makes it difficult for a user with vision impairment to use an assistive reading device, such as a speech synthesizer, along with your app correctly.

Perry"],"pages":"499","publication_date":"May 2024","description":"This book teaches you how to evaluate a distributed system from the perspective of immutable objects. You will understand the problems in existing designs, know how to make small modifications to correct those problems, and learn to apply the principles of immutable architecture to your tools.\nMost software components focus on the state of objects. They store the current state of a row in a relational database. They track changes to state over time, making several basic assumptions: there is a single latest version of each object, the state of an object changes sequentially, and a system of record exists.\nThis is a challenge when it comes to building distributed systems. Whether dealing with autonomous microservices or disconnected mobile apps, many of the problems we try to solve come down to synchronizing an ever-changing state between isolated components. Distributed systems would be a lot easier to build if objects could not change.\nAfter reading The Art of Immutable Architecture, you will come away with an understanding of the benefits of using immutable objects in your own distributed systems. You will learn a set of rules for identifying and exchanging immutable objects, and see a collection of useful theorems that emerges and ensures that the distributed systems you build are eventually consistent. Using patterns, you will find where the truth converges, see how changes are associative, rather than sequential, and come to feel comfortable understanding that there is no longer a single source of truth. Practical hands-on examples reinforce how to build software using the described patterns, techniques, and tools. By the end of the book, you will possess the language and resources needed to analyze and construct distributed systems with confidence.\nThe assumptions of the past were sufficient for building single-user, single-computer systems. But aswe expand to multiple devices, shared experiences, and cloud computing, they work against us. It is time for a new set of assumptions. Start with immutable objects, and build better distributed systems.\n\nWhat You Will Learn\nEvaluate a distributed system from the perspective of immutable objects \nRecognize the problems in existing designs, and make small modifications to correct them\nStart a new system from scratch, applying patterns\nApply the principles of immutable architecture to your tools, including SQL databases, message queues, and the network protocols that you already use \nDiscover new tools that natively apply these principles \nWho This Book Is For\nSoftware architects and senior developers.

The mission is to keep the user in mind at each step or milestone as the developer progresses through the project. The process is how that mission is accomplished through collaboration and the use of research, design and development technologies. This book walks you through a developer's journey through the UX process, from start to finish. \n\nA Guide to UX Design and Development concentrates on the intersection of what is called “DesignOps” and “DevOps.” That intersection is where collaboration between all members of the team, including stakeholders and clients, occurs and neither DesignOps nor DevOps can go beyond being considered just buzzwords if they instead silo design and development. To highlight the UX Mission and illustrate the responsibility developers also hold for the user experience, authors Tom Green and Joseph Labrecque take you througha hypothetical project involving the development of a parking app for a municipal parking authority. As the book progresses, they concentrate on the developer's journey through the whole project from discovery to product release. In this journey, you will see how developers can make an impact and contribute to the user experience.\n\nThis will include such topics as why there is a need for both a user journey map and a technical journey map. The authors explain why prototyping is not as complicated as it is made out to be because it is simply an early low-cost and disposable minimal viable product that gives the developer a deep understanding of the project's intent in support of the UX Mission. You will also explore the creation and use of design systems and why the developer's role is just as important as the people who create the design system. The role and responsibility of the developer in user testing is discussed in the context of a variety of testing and assessment methodsconducted to achieve the UX mission.\n\nFinally, you’ll gain an understanding of how design and development deliverables are negotiated, prepared and sent out for research at each step of the process, and how the developer is involved.\n\nWhat You Will Learn\n\nUnderstand the evolving role of the developer in a team-based environment\nLearn the five stages of the UX process \nDiscover the importance of collaboration and communication with stakeholders, designers, and developers at every stage of the process\nLearn a variety of design and development documents created during the UX process\n\nWho This Book Is For\n\nDevelopers and designers involved in the UX Process, as well as developers trying to make sense of the confusing amount of information out there regarding their role in the UX process.","tags":["Design","Product Design","User Experience (UX)"]},{"id":"9780760391617","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Debt-Free Art Degree: Foundations in Drawing","authors":["Marco Bucci"],"pages":"176","publication_date":"November 2024","description":"Debt-Free Art Degree: Foundations in Drawing offers an affordable, easy-to-follow education in drawing that includes all the instruction and encouragement you need to succeed.","tags":["Design","Visual Design","Drawing & Painting"]},{"id":"9780133892956","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Social Media Analytics: Techniques and Insights for Extracting Business Value Out of Social Media","authors":["Matthew Ganis","Avinash Kohirkar"],"pages":"350","publication_date":"December 2015","description":"Transform Raw Social Media Data into Real Competitive Advantage\n\nThere’s real competitive advantage buried in today’s deluge of social media data.

There are many techniques currently available to encrypt and secure our communication channels. Data hiding techniques can take data confidentiality to a new level as we can hide our secret messages in ordinary, honest-looking data files.\n\nSteganography is the science of hiding data. It has several categorizations, and each type has its own techniques in hiding. Steganography has played a vital role in secret communication during wars since the dawn of history. In recent days, few computer users successfully manage to exploit their Windows® machine to conceal their private data.\n\nBusinesses also have deep concerns about misusing data hiding techniques. Many employers are amazed at how easily their valuable information can get out of their company walls. In many legal cases a disgruntled employee would successfully steal company private data despite all security measures implemented using simple digital hiding techniques.\n\nHuman right activists who live in countries controlled by oppressive regimes need ways to smuggle their online communications without attracting surveillance monitoring systems, continuously scan in/out internet traffic for interesting keywords and other artifacts. The same applies to journalists and whistleblowers all over the world.\n\nComputer forensic investigators, law enforcements officers, intelligence services and IT security professionals need a guide to tell them where criminals can conceal their data in Windows® OS & multimedia files and how they can discover concealed data quickly and retrieve it in a forensic way.\n\nData Hiding Techniques in Windows OS is a response to all these concerns. Data hiding topics are usually approached in most books using an academic method, with long math equations about how each hiding technique algorithm works behind the scene, and are usually targeted at people who work in the academic arenas.

This new, second edition of Robust Statistics: Theory and Methods (with R) presents a broad coverage of the theory of robust statistics that is integrated with computing methods and applications. Updated to include important new research results of the last decade and focus on the use of the popular software package R, it features in-depth coverage of the key methodology, including regression, multivariate analysis, and time series modeling. The book is illustrated throughout by a range of examples and applications that are supported by a companion website featuring data sets and R code that allow the reader to reproduce the examples given in the book.\n\nUnlike other books on the market, Robust Statistics: Theory and Methods (with R) offers the most comprehensive, definitive, and up-to-date treatment of the subject. It features chapters on estimating location and scale; measuring robustness; linear regression with fixed and with random predictors; multivariate analysis; generalized linear models; time series; numerical algorithms; and asymptotic theory of M-estimates.\n\nExplains both the use and theoretical justification of robust methods\nGuides readers in selecting and using the most appropriate robust methods for their problems\nFeatures computational algorithms for the core methods\n\nRobust statistics research results of the last decade included in this 2nd edition include: fast deterministic robust regression, finite-sample robustness, robust regularized regression, robust location and scatter estimation with missing data, robust estimation with independent outliers in variables, and robust mixed linear models.\n\nRobust Statistics aims to stimulate the use of robust methods as a powerful tool to increase the reliability and accuracy of statistical modelling and data analysis. It is an ideal resource for researchers, practitioners, and graduate students in statistics, engineering, computer science, and physical and social sciences.","tags":["Data","Data Science","Data Science Tasks","Statistics"]},{"id":"9781317383444","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Independent Filmmaking and Digital Convergence","authors":["Vladan Nikolic"],"pages":"292","publication_date":"December 2016","description":"Independent Filmmaking and Digital Convergence: Transmedia and Beyond offers a comprehensive analysis of the technological changes of the past few decades in independent film and media-making, and explores new strategies and practices in media production, exhibition and distribution for independent producers and content creators.

Statistical Learning with Sparsity: The Lasso and Generalizations presents methods that exploit sparsity to help recover the underlying signal in a set of data.\n\nTop experts in this rapidly evolving field, the authors describe the lasso for linear regression and a simple coordinate descent algorithm for its computation. They discuss the application of ℓ1 penalties to generalized linear models and support vector machines, cover generalized penalties such as the elastic net and group lasso, and review numerical methods for optimization. They also present statistical inference methods for fitted (lasso) models, including the bootstrap, Bayesian methods, and recently developed approaches. In addition, the book examines matrix decomposition, sparse multivariate analysis, graphical models, and compressed sensing. It concludes with a survey of theoretical results for the lasso.\n\nIn this age of big data, the number of features measured on a person or object can be large and might be larger than the number of observations. This book shows how the sparsity assumption allows us to tackle these problems and extract useful and reproducible patterns from big datasets.

Unfortunately, traditional test design techniques are often ineffective and unreliable for revealing the various kinds of faults that may occur. This book introduces three new software testing techniques: Two-Phase Model-Based Testing, the Action-State Testing, and the General Predicate Testing, all of which work best when applied with efficient fault revealing capabilities.\n\nYou’ll start with a short recap of software testing, focusing on why risk analysis is obligatory, how to classify bugs practically, and how fault-based testing can be used for improving test design. You’ll then see how action-state testing merges the benefits of state transition testing and use case testing into a unified approach. Moving on you’ll look at general predicate testing and how it serves as an extension of boundary value analysis, encompassing morecomplex predicates. \n\nTwo-phase model-based testing represents an advanced approach where the model does not necessarily need to be machine-readable; human readability suffices. The first phase involves a high-level model from which abstract tests are generated. Upon manual execution of these tests, the test code is generated. Rather than calculating output values, they are merely checked for conformity. The last part of this book contains a chapter on how developers and testers can help each other and work as a collaborative team. \n\nWhat You'll Learn\n\nApply efficient test design techniques for detecting domain faults\nWork with modeling techniques that combine all the advantages of state transition testing and uses case testing\nGrasp the two-phase model-based testing technique\nUse test design efficiently to find almost all the bugs in an application\n\nWho This Book Is For\n\nSoftware developers, QA engineers, and, business analysts","tags":["Data","Data Science","Data Science Tasks","A/B Testing"]},{"id":"9780128001141","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"An Introduction to Probability and Statistical Inference, 2nd Edition","authors":["George G.

As almost every photographer knows, the word “photograph” has its roots in two Greek words that, together, mean “drawing with light.” But what is less commonly acknowleEAed and understood is the role that shadow plays in creating striking, expressive imagery, especially in portraiture. It is through deft, nuanced use of both light and shadow that you can move beyond shooting simply ordinary, competent headshots into the realm of creating dramatic portraiture that can so powerfully convey a subject’s inner essence, communicate a personal narrative, and express your photographic vision.\n\nIn The Dramatic Portrait: The Art of Crafting Light and Shadow, Chris Knight addresses portraiture with a unique approach to both light and shadow that allows you to improve and elevate your own portraiture. He begins with the history of portraiture, from the early work of Egyptians and Greeks to the sublime treatment of light and subject by artists such as Caravaggio, Rembrandt, and Vermeer. Chris then dives into a deep, hands-on exploration of light, shadow, and portraiture, offering numerous lessons and takeaways. He covers:\n\n• The qualities of light: hard, soft, and the spectrum in between\n• The relationships between light, subject, and background, and how to control them\n• Lighting patterns such as Paramount, Rembrandt, loop, and split\n• Lighting ratios and how they affect contrast in your image\n• Equipment: from big and small modifiers to grids, snoots, barn doors, flags, and gels\n• Multiple setups for portrait shoots, including those that utilize one, two, and three lights\n• How color contributes to drama and mood, eliciting an emotional response from the viewer\n• How to approach styling your portrait, from wardrobe to background\n• The post-processing workflow, including developing the RAW file, maximizing contrast, color grading, retouching, and doEAing and burning for heightened drama and effect\n• How all of these elements culminate to help you define your personal style and create your own narrative","tags":["Design","Visual Design","Photography"]},{"id":"9781119044963","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Becoming a Graphic and Digital Designer: A Guide to Careers in Design, 5th Edition","authors":["Steven Heller","Veronique Vienne"],"pages":"336","publication_date":"April 2015","description":"Begin your graphic design career now, with the guidance of industry experts\n\nBecoming a Graphic and Digital Designer is a single source guide to the myriad of options available to those pursuing a graphic design career.

The Digital Zone System (DZS) is an innovative methodology for editing digital images that mimics the Zone System created by Adams. With this book, author Robert Fisher presents a practical guide for editing digital images with a level of control previously unattainable without significant manual work. He walks the reader through the background of Adam's original Zone System and points out similarities to current digital processes including Expose to the Right (ETTR) and high dynamic range imaging (HDRI). Learn to use luminance masks to separate an image into \"one-stop\" zones of brightness, similar to the zones in Adams's Zone System, that can be worked on individually or in groups. This makes the DZS a powerful tool for converting color images to black and white. You will also gain tremendous control over how color is adjusted in your images by learning to isolate and adjust color in specific targeted areas. These DZS processes are quicker and simpler than the tedious work of using global adjustments and painting in layer masks to isolate the effects of an adjustment layer.In this book, you will learn how to use the Digital Zone System for editing color images, converting images to black and white, and tone mapping HDR images. Also included are brief discussions of color management, setting up Photoshop, printing, and exposure for digital images. The book is richly illustrated with step-by-step screenshots and stunning example images that show the benefits of the Digital Zone System over commonly used digital editing methods. Once mastered, the DZS will allow you to produce a higher level of quality in your images, at a faster pace and with greater ease than ever before.","tags":["Software Development","Graphics Programming","Digital Image Processing"]},{"id":"9780415829588","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Digital Audio Editing","authors":["Simon Langford"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"October 2013","description":"Whether you’re comping a vocal track, restoring an old recording, working with dialogue or sound effects for film, or imposing your own vision with mash-ups or remixes, audio editing is a key skill to successful sound production.

Instead, Vanessa gives you the basics you need so that you can start shooting right away without becoming overwhelmed with technical jargon.\n\nOnce you’re set up and ready to go, Vanessa jumps right into Part Two with specific photo scenarios and real-world situations where you’ll learn key techniques for using your flash to create consistent, beautiful photographs. For each scenario, Vanessa provides the goal for the shoot, a gear list, the step-by-step shooting instructions, and images that show both the progress of the shoot and the behind-the-scenes shots or lighting diagrams of the setup. She also discusses problems you may encounter, variations on the shot, and additional practical scenarios for each situation.\n\nJust a few examples include:\n\n• Recreating the golden hour at any time\n• Shooting groups\n• Making indoors look like outdoors\n• Enhancing natural light\n• Using flash at events\n• Working in harsh sunlight\n• Creating silhouettes\n• Shooting at sunset\n• Fixing an ugly-light room\n• And much more\n\nFinally, Part Three tackles the questions you’ll likely have once you’ve got the basics under your belt and you’re already creating great photos with your off-camera flash—things like high-speed sync, sync speed, a practical understanding of the inverse square law, etc. There is also a helpful FAQ section at the end of the book.","tags":["Design","Visual Design","Photography"]},{"id":"9781838821654","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Advanced Deep Learning with TensorFlow 2 and Keras - Second Edition","authors":["Rowel Atienza"],"pages":"512","publication_date":"February 2020","description":"This definitive guide delves into the breadth of deep learning methodologies, emphasizing hands-on applications with TensorFlow 2 and Keras.

For example, the chapter on database monitoring explains how to monitor database availability, database changes, database security, database backups, database growth, database workload, database performance, and database capacity.\n\nThe chapters of this book are logically organized into four parts that closely track the way your database administration career will naturally evolve. Part 1 gives you necessary background in relational database theory and Oracle Database concepts, Part 2 teaches you how to implement an Oracle database correctly, Part 3 exposes you to the daily routine of a database administrator, and Part 4 introduces you to the fine art of performance tuning. Each chapter has exercises designed to help you apply the lessons of the chapter. Each chapter also includes a list of reference works that contain more information on the topic of the chapter.\n\nIn this book, you'll find information that you won't find in other books on Oracle Database. Here you'll discover not only technical information, but also guidance on work practices that are as vital to your success as technical skills. The author's favorite chapter is \"The Big Picture and the Ten Deliverables.\" If you take the lessons in that chapter to heart, you can quickly become a much better Oracle database administrator than you ever thought possible.\n\nWhat you'll learn\n\nTheory of relational database management systems\n\nOracle Database internals\n\nLicensing, architecture, and sizing\n\nSoftware installation and database creation\n\nUsing indexes to improve performance\n\nUser management and data loading\n\nHow to monitor all aspects of your database\n\nHow to solve and fix problems\n\nDatabase backups and database recovery\n\nDatabase maintenance\n\nDatabase tuning\n\nSQL tuning\n\nWho this book is for\n\nIf you are an IT professional who has been thrust into an Oracle database administration role without the benefit of formal training, or you just want to understand how Oracle Database works, this book is for you. It's the book the author wishes he'd had when he first started using Oracle Database many years ago. It's the book that he would have liked to have given to the many IT colleagues and friends who, over the years, have asked him to teach them the basics of Oracle Database.","tags":["IT Operations","Service Administration","Database Administration"]},{"id":"0131963635","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Idealized Design: Creating an Organization’s Future","authors":["Russell L.

In relation to others, and in relation to the past? Commonly associated with the ideas of benchmarking and baselining, comparative assessment is an important part of organizational management, but this broadly defined undertaking lacks clear conceptual framing and methodological foundations. At the same time, the readily available transactional data make robust tracking and measurement possible at an unprecedented scale, but also accentuate the impact of assessment paradox: To be truly meaningful, exact magnitudes-expressed values often need to be ‘translated’ into qualitative, assessment-laden categories, but that task is impeded by lack of established approaches for doing so.\n\nInspired by these observations, Probabilistic Benchmarking frames the notions of benchmarking and baselining as two complementary but distinct mechanisms of comparative assessment that make use of informational contents of organizational data to contribute unbiased, systematic, and consistent evaluation of outcomes or states of interest. In that general context, this book provides much-needed conceptual and methodological clarity to guide construction and use of benchmarks and baselines, and re-casts the idea of assessment standards in the context of data-derived estimates, to better align the practice of comparative assessment with the emerging realities of the Age of Data.\n\nThis pioneering research-based but application-minded book bridges the gap between theory and practice. It will greatly benefit professionals, business students and others interested in the broad domain of organizational assessment.","tags":["IT Operations","Service Administration","Database Administration","Data Quality"]},{"id":"9781839219856","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Deep Learning Workshop","authors":["Mirza Rahim Baig","Thomas Joseph","Nipun Sadvilkar"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"July 2020","description":"The Deep Learning Workshop is a hands-on guide designed to teach you the principles of deep learning using TensorFlow and Keras.

Not matching supply with demand can make or break any business, and that's why forecasting is so invaluable. Forecasting can appear as a frightening topic with many arcane equations to master. For this reason, the authors start out from the very basics and provide a non-technical overview of common forecasting techniques as well as organizational aspects of creating a robust forecasting process. The book also discusses how to measure forecast accuracy to hold people accountable and guide continuous improvement. This book does not require prior knowledge of higher mathematics, statistics, or operations research. It is designed to serve as a first introduction to the non-expert, such as a manager overseeing a forecasting group, or an MBA student who needs to be familiar with the broad outlines of forecasting without specializing in it.","tags":["Data","Data Science","Data Science Tasks","Statistics","Time Series","Forecasting"]},{"id":"9781789451115","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Face Analysis Under Uncontrolled Conditions","authors":["Romain Belmonte","Benjamin Allaert"],"pages":"320","publication_date":"November 2022","description":"Face analysis is essential for a large number of applications such as human-computer interaction or multimedia (e.g. content indexing and retrieval).

Is it truly valuable to support decision-making ? What kind of decision can be truly supported and how can I handle residual uncertainty ? How much refined should the mathematical description be, given the true data limitations ? Could the uncertainty be reduced through more data, increased modeling investment or computational budget ? Should it be reduced now or later ? How robust is the analysis or the computational methods involved ? Should / could those methods be more robust ? Does it make sense to handle uncertainty, risk, lack of knowledge, variability or errors altogether ? How reasonable is the choice of probabilistic modeling for rare events ? How rare are the events to be considered ? How far does it make sense to handle extreme events and elaborate confidence figures ? Can I take advantage of expert / phenomenological knowledge to tighten the probabilistic figures ? Are there connex domains that could provide models or inspiration for my problem ?\n\nWritten by a leader at the crossroads of industry, academia and engineering, and based on decades of multi-disciplinary field experience, Modelling Under Risk and Uncertainty gives a self-consistent introduction to the methods involved by any type of modeling development acknowledging the inevitable uncertainty and associated risks. It goes beyond the \"black-box\" view that some analysts, modelers, risk experts or statisticians develop on the underlying phenomenology of the environmental or industrial processes, without valuing enough their physical properties and inner modelling potential nor challenging the practical plausibility of mathematical hypotheses; conversely it is also to attract environmental or engineering modellers to better handle model confidence issues through finer statistical and risk analysis material taking advantage of advanced scientific computing, to face new regulations departing from deterministic design or support robust decision-making.\n\nModelling Under Risk and Uncertainty:\n\nAddresses a concern of growing interest for large industries, environmentalists or analysts: robust modeling for decision-making in complex systems.\n\nGives new insights into the peculiar mathematical and computational challenges generated by recent industrial safety or environmental control analysis for rare events.\n\nImplements decision theory choices differentiating or aggregating the dimensions of risk/aleatory and epistemic uncertainty through a consistent multi-disciplinary set of statistical estimation, physical modelling, robust computation and risk analysis.\n\nProvides an original review of the advanced inverse probabilistic approaches for model identification, calibration or data assimilation, key to digest fast-growing multi-physical data acquisition.\n\nIllustrated with one favourite pedagogical example crossing natural risk, engineering and economics, developed throughout the book to facilitate the reading and understanding.\n\nSupports Master/PhD-level course as well as advanced tutorials for professional training\n\nAnalysts and researchers in numerical modeling, applied statistics, scientific computing, reliability, advanced engineering, natural risk or environmental science will benefit from this book.","tags":["Data","Data Science","Data Science Tasks","Statistics"]},{"id":"9780123750303","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Designing with the Mind in Mind","authors":["Jeff Johnson"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"May 2010","description":"Early user interface (UI) practitioners were trained in cognitive psychology, from which UI design rules were based.

And if you take enough pictures, you’re bound to get lucky and create a few “keepers” that impress family and friends. But eventually, you hit a wall; you know you’re relying more on luck than skill. Even learning to control the fundamental, technical components of the craft—shutter speed, aperture, and ISO—only takes you so far. The real challenges remain: How can you learn to make good images consistently? And how can you really start to “see” photographic possibilities all around you?\n\nIn Making Photographs, photographer, educator, and author Ibarionex Perello teaches you how to face and conquer such challenges. He shares the approach and techniques he’s honed over the last 15 years conducting workshops and teaching photography courses to countless students of the craft. The key to this approach, Ibarionex argues, is to develop and implement a visual workflow that allows you to create a repeatable process for your photography. This workflow revolves around the four “visual draws”—light and shadow, line and shape, color, and gesture. As Ibarionex discusses each of these visual draws, you’ll learn how to move beyond merely “looking” at the world around you to “seeing” photographic possibilities at every turn. It is this act of seeing that gives photography its magic—and you the vital tool you need to improve your work. Rather than simply taking pictures, you'll begin making photographs.\n\nIbarionex also covers topics such as exposure, composition, preparation, lighting, the role of emotion, culling your images, self-assessment, and post-processing. Alongside discussion of these themes and principles, he presents the stories behind his photographs, which reveal his thought process as he works through a scene; shares entries from his personal photographic journal, relaying successes, failures, discoveries, and breakthroughs; and includes assignments and personal challenges to inspire and motivate you to put these principles into immediate action in your photography.","tags":["Design","Visual Design","Photography"]},{"id":"9781118002766","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"SolidWorks® 2011 Assemblies Bible","authors":["Matt Lombard"],"pages":"648","publication_date":"August 2011","description":"A fan of theSolidWorks Bible, but want more detail on assemblies?

Now it's shaking things up again as editor Walter Murch, director Anthony Minghella, and a long list of Hollywood heavy-hitters are proving that this under-$1,000 software can (and should) be used to edit a multi-million dollar motion picture! This book tells the story of that endeavor: the decision to use Final Cut Pro, the relationship between the technology and art (and craft) of movie-making, how Final Cut Pro was set up and configured for Cold Mountain, how the software's use affected the work flow, and its implications for the future of filmmaking. More than anything, however, this is Murch's own story of what seemed to many a crazy endeavor-- told through photos, journal entries, email musings, and anecdotes that give readers an inside view of what the film editor does and how this particular film progressed through post-production. The book includes, in his own words, Murch's vision, approach, and thoughts on storytelling as he shapes Cold Mountain under the intense pressures of completing a major studio film.\n\nWith Academy Awards for his work on Apocalypse Now and The English Patient, sound and film editor Walter Murch is one of the few universally acknowledged editing masters in cinema. Along with George Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola, he is one of the founding members of the Northern California cinema community. Author Charles Koppelman has been writing screenplays and directing video and film since the early 1980s, including the independent feature film, Dumbarton Bridge, award-winning documentaries, and commercials.\n\n\"An exploration inside the editorial engine-room of a major feature film - the first book of its kind ever and sure to remain the best. Charles Koppelman chronicles Walter Murch's astonishing high-wire trapeze act as he works his way through the first large-scale implementation of Apple's Final Cut Pro editing software. Must be read by anyone interested in film, computers, or how the creative process unfolds.\" -- Francis Ford Coppola, director of The Conversation, The Godfather, Apocalypse Now\n\n\"This is probably the subtlest and most tender account of what a craftsman brings to a motion picture ever written. It is fascinating in its detail and awesome in its gradual uncovering of the ear, the eye and the soul of Walter Murch. The book may seem technical, or 'professional,' but any reader will be thrilled by the description of a struggle and the necessary commitment to it. To be read by anyone who has ever thought it might be fun to make a movie.\" -- David Thomson, film critic and author of The Biographical Dictionary\n\n\"BEHIND THE SEEN is not only revelatory in terms of technical innovation, but it reads like a thrilling suspense novel. Superbly written and paced, the book captures the brilliant and daring film/sound editor-scientist Walter Murch in all his passionate and creative glory. Charles Koppelman has crafted a truly unique addition to the canon of film history, delivering a must-read for anyone interested in how movies are made.\" --Barry Gifford, author of Wild at Heart, Lost Highway and City of Ghosts\n\n\"... excellent, original and tremendously informative book... Koppelman's account reads like a thriller...

Traditionally this has been done by using passive crossover units built into the loudspeaker boxes; this is the simplest solution, but it is also a bundle of compromises. The high cost of passive crossover components, and the power losses in them, means that passive crossovers have to use relatively few parts. This limits how well the crossover can do its basic job.\n\nActive crossovers, sometimes called electronic crossovers, tackle the problem in a much more sophisticated manner. The division of the audio into bands is performed at low signal levels, before the power amplifiers, where it can be done with much greater precision. Very sophisticated filtering and response-shaping networks can be built at comparatively low cost. Time-delay networks that compensate for phyical misalignments in speaker construction can be implemented easily; the equivalent in a passive crossover is impractical because of the large cost and the heavy signal losses. Active crossover technology is also directly applicable to other band-splitting signal-processing devices such as multi-band compressors.\n\nThe use of active crossovers is increasing. They are used by almost every sound reinforcement system, by almost every recording studio monitoring set-up, and to a small but growing extent in domestic hifi. There is a growing acceptance in the hifi industry that multi-amplification using active crossovers is the obvious next step (and possibly the last big one) to getting the best possible sound. There is also a large usage of active crossovers in car audio, with the emphasis on routing the bass to enormous low-frequency loudspeakers.\n\nOne of the very few drawbacks to using the active crossover approach is that it requires more power amplifiers; these have often been built into the loudspeaker, along with the crossover, and this deprives the customer of the chance to choose their own amplifier, leading to resistance to the whole active crossover philosophy. A comprehensive proposal for solving this problem is an important part of this book.\n\nThe design of active crossovers is closely linked with that of the loudspeakers they drive. A chapter gives a concise but complete account of all the loudspeaker design issues that affect the associated active crossover.\n\nThis book is packed full of valuable information, with virtually every page revealing nuggets of specialized knowledge never before published. Essential points of theory bearing on practical performance are lucidly and thoroughly explained, with the mathematics kept to an essential minimum. Douglas' background in design for manufacture ensures he keeps a wary eye on the cost of things.\n\nFeatures:\n\nCrossover basics and requirements\n\nThe many different crossover types and how they work\n\nDesign almost any kind of active filter with minimal mathematics\n\nMake crossover filters with very low noise and distortion\n\nMake high-performance time-delay filters that give a constant delay over a wide range of frequency\n\nMake a wide variety of audio equaliser stages: shelving, peaking and notch characteristics\n\nAll about active crossover system design for optimal noise and dynamic range\n\nThere is a large amount of new material that has never been published before. A few examples: using capacitance multipliers in biquad equalisers, opamp output biasing to reduce distortion, the design of NTMTM notch crossovers, the design of special filters for filler-driver crossovers, the use of mixed capacitors to reduce filter distortion, differentially elevated internal levels to reduce noise, and so on.\n\nDouglas wears his learning lightly, and this book features the engaging prose style familiar from his other books The Audio Power Amplifier Design Handbook, Self on Audio, and the recent Small Signal Audio Design.","tags":["Design","Music & Audio"]},{"id":"9781466553316","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Developing Essbase Applications","authors":["Cameron Lackpour"],"pages":"445","publication_date":"June 2012","description":"If you love Essbase and hate seeing it misused, then this is the book for you.

Schmidt, Inventor of ACE, from the Foreword\n\nThis book is a must-have for every ACE programmer. For the beginner, it explains step-by-step how to start using ACE. For the more experienced programmer, it explains in detail the features used daily, and is a perfect reference manual. It would have saved me a lot of time if this book had been available some years ago! --Johnny Willemsen, Senior Software Engineer, Remedy IT, The Netherlands\n\nWith a large C++ code base, we rely on ACE to enable a cross-platform client-server framework for data quality and data integration.

For non-Korean-speaking viewers, subtitles are crucial to the experience. Enter Viki Inc., a company that hosts content for streaming and provides subtitles and closed captions. Viki both eliminates language barriers and introduces the content to an otherwise unserved audience.\n\nTraditionally, subtitles are created by a bilingual translator hired by the producer or broadcaster. But the process is expensive and slow to scale. To overcome these challenges, Viki developed a business model leveraging a community of more than 150,000 volunteers. This model allows Viki to crowdsource subtitles for Asian content in numerous languages. Viki rewards volunteers with gamified badges, the ability to view videos not otherwise available in their region, early access to new shows, and an advertising-free, high-definition experience of the content.\n\nThe combination of rapidly increasing internet video adoption rates and a greater appetite for foreign content — both in Asia and globally — has become a big opportunity for Viki, which was acquired by Tokyo-based Rakuten Inc. for a reported price of $200 million in 2013.\n\nThe authors argue that Viki's story exemplifies a larger trend playing out in Asia. They see Viki as an archetype of a new generation of companies leveraging business model innovation to drive growth in Asia. But to understand this type of business model innovation in its proper context, it's important to understand Viki's forerunners. The authors describe two distinct, yet overlapping, waves of business innovation from emerging markets in Asia in recent years: one decades old and still going, and another that is newer and includes companies like Viki.\n\nThe first wave primarily exploited differences in labor and other input costs between developed and developing markets. By contrast, the second wave is driven primarily by business model innovation and typically leverages new technology. These companies are characterized by extensive and often radical reconfigurations of the profit formula, resources, processes, and relationships within a broader stakeholder ecosystem. They may have a global orientation from the start.\n\nEstablished companies, the authors argue, can also embrace the opportunity for business model innovation. The authors cite examples such as Medtronic Inc. and MetLife Inc., which have both been experimenting with new business models in Asia. The authors also offer suggestions for how established companies can start to explore business model innovation.","tags":["Design","Visual Design","Film & Video"]},{"id":"0596527683","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Practical Color Management: Eddie Tapp on Digital Photography","authors":["Eddie Tapp","Rick Lucas"],"pages":"168","publication_date":"October 2006","description":"The second book in this acclaimed series from noted photographer and digital imaging expert Eddie Tapp delves into color management, a topic that has needlessly become a mystery to experienced digital photographers, whether they're avid amateurs, serious students, or working professionals.

Woerner"],"pages":"8","publication_date":"July 2015","description":"The business world is rapidly digitizing, breaking down industry barriers and creating new opportunities while destroying long-successful business models. Given the amount of turmoil digital disruption is causing, authors Peter Weill and Stephanie L. Woerner of the MIT Center for Information Systems Research say it’s time for companies to evaluate these threats and opportunities and create new business options for the more-connected future of digital ecosystems. In recent research, board members at large companies estimated that 32% of their company’s revenue would be under threat from digital disruption in the next five years; 60% of board members felt their boards should spend significantly more time on this issue next year. Despite the threats from companies including Uber, Airbnb and Amazon, increasing digitization offers opportunities for companies to leverage strong customer relationships and increase cross-selling, the authors argue. The authors offer a framework, supported by examples, for helping managers think about their competitive environments. “The combination of moving from value chains to ecosystems and increasing consumer knowledge,” the authors write, “provides business leaders with four distinct business models, each with associated capabilities and relationships.” Companies can choose to operate as (1) suppliers, (2) omnichannel businesses, (3) modular producers or (4) ecosystem drivers. The authors found that businesses focused narrowly on value chains were at a disadvantage compared with those that thought more broadly about their business ecosystems. Companies that had 50% or more of their revenues from digital ecosystems and understood their end customers better than their average competitor saw 32% higher revenue growth and 27% higher profit margins than their industry averages. As they prepare for growing digital disruption, companies have two major decisions to make. First, they need to decide the extent to which they want to control the value chain or become part of a more complex ecosystem. Second, they need to decide how much they want to invest in knowing their end customers. Companies with ecosystem drivers as their dominant business model had the highest margins and growth of all the four options in the companies the authors studied.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Digital Transformation"]},{"id":"9781430264064","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Disaster Recovery, Crisis Response, and Business Continuity: A Management Desk Reference","authors":["Jamie Watters"],"pages":"316","publication_date":"December 2013","description":"You're in charge of IT, facilities, or core operations for your organization when a hurricane or a fast-moving wildfire hits.

While individuals traditionally have seen ownership as the most desirable way, increasing numbers of consumers are paying to temporarily access or share products and services rather than buy or own them. This so-called “sharing economy” is growing rapidly, although estimates for the current size of the nascent market vary substantially. Well-known examples of successful startups built on collaborative consumption systems include Airbnb Inc.\n\nGrowth in sharing systems has been particularly fueled by the Internet with its rise of social media systems, which facilitate connections between peers eager to share their possessions. The central conceit of collaborative consumption is simple: obtain value from untapped potential residing in goods that are not entirely exploited by their owners.\n\nThe sharing economy might represent a serious threat to established industries. However, the authors’ research suggests six ways in which companies can respond: (1) by selling use of a product rather than ownership, (2) by supporting customers in their desire to resell goods, (3) by exploiting unused resources and capacities, (4) by providing repair and maintenance services, (5) by using collaborative consumption to target new customers, and (6) by developing entirely new business models enabled by collaborative consumption.","tags":["Business","Digital Economy","Gig Economy"]},{"id":"53863MIT60309","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"How Digital Leadership Is(n’t) Different","authors":["Gerald C.

Tap into one or more of these, and your brand will stick forever.\n\nIn Branding Between the Ears, world-renowned marketing thought leader Sandeep Dayal explains how to leverage behavioral psychology, social anthropology, and neuroscience to decode what goes on in consumer minds—and create effective marketing strategies to build the kind of loyalty that fuels today’s iconic brands. Dayal reveals that most successful cognitive brands are architected around three questions consumers ask themselves:\n\nDoes this brand give me good vibes?\nDoes what this brand says make sense to me?\nWill I be happier if I buy this brand?\nThese three factors—good brand vibes, brand sense, and brand resolve—are the hidden mantra that push customers off the fence of indecision, and get them not just to admire, but actually buy the brands again and again.Branding Between the Ears reveals paradigm shifts in building and executing brands that are informed by a burgeoning body of research in brain sciences, and offers a better way to make brands that not just stand out, but connect with consumers and embed deeply in their thoughts to drive choice.Dayal is the marketing thought leader who predicted that “consumer collaboration” would be the key factor in winning people’s trust online and giving consumers control over their personal information would be central to gaining their trust—issues that are unfolding today.Now, with Branding Between the Ears he provides equally prescient principles and new ideas for gaining the competitive edge in a largely uncertain future and winning with cognitive power brands.","tags":["Design","Branding"]},{"id":"9781789340990","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Hands-On Deep Learning with Go","authors":["Gareth Seneque","Darrell Chua"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"August 2019","description":"Dive into the world of deep learning with Go, the programming language designed for scalable and efficient development.

Kirk also helps you edit recordings in Rogue Amoeba’s Fission audio editor.\n\nYou’ll learn how to pipe sound through Audio Hijack to enhance its quality without recording. For example, by boosting the volume or tweaking the bass—movies on Netflix never sounded better!\n\nYou’ll also discover special features such as reusable sessions, recording to more than one file (and format) at once, scheduling recordings, time shifting during live playback, effects like ducking and panning, adding automatic metadata before recording, and more. And you'll learn how to use Audio Hijack as a powerful tool for live streaming or broadcasting.\n\nThe Fission chapter has directions for trimming, cropping, adding, replacing, splitting, and fading audio.

Virtually every choice we make hinges on how someone generates data . . . and how someone else interprets it--whether we realize it or not.\n\nWhere do you send your child for the best education? Big Data. Which airline should you choose to ensure a timely arrival? Big Data. Who will you vote for in the next election? Big Data.\n\nThe problem is, the more data we have, the more difficult it is to interpret it. From world leaders to average citizens, everyone is prone to making critical decisions based on poor data interpretations.\n\nIn Numbersense, expert statistician Kaiser Fung explains when you should accept the conclusions of the Big Data \"experts\"--and when you should say, \"Wait . . . what?\" He delves deeply into a wide range of topics, offering the answers to important questions, such as:\n\nHow does the college ranking system really work?\nCan an obesity measure solve America's biggest healthcare crisis?\nShould you trust current unemployment data issued by the government?\nHow do you improve your fantasy sports team?\nShould you worry about businesses that track your data?\n\nDon't take for granted statements made in the media, by our leaders, or even by your best friend. We're on information overload today, and there's a lot of bad information out there.\n\nNumbersense gives you the insight into how Big Data interpretation works--and how it too often doesn't work. You won't come away with the skills of a professional statistician. But you will have a keen understanding of the data traps even the best statisticians can fall into, and you'll trust the mental alarm that goes off in your head when something just doesn't seem to add up.\n\nPraise for Numbersense\n\n\"Numbersense correctly puts the emphasis not on the size of big data, but on the analysis of it. Lots of fun stories, plenty of lessons learned—in short, a great way to acquire your own sense of numbers!\"Thomas H. Davenport, coauthor of Competing on Analytics and President’s Distinguished Professor of IT and Management, Babson College\n\n\"Kaiser’s accessible business book will blow your mind like no other. You’ll be smarter, and you won’t even realize it. Buy. It. Now.\"Avinash Kaushik, Digital Marketing Evangelist, Google, and author, Web Analytics 2.0\n\n\"Each story in Numbersense goes deep into what you have to think about before you trust the numbers. Kaiser Fung ably demonstrates that it takes skill and resourcefulness to make the numbers confess their meaning.\"John Sall, Executive Vice President, SAS Institute\n\n\"Kaiser Fung breaks the bad news—a ton more data is no panacea—but then has got your back, revealing the pitfalls of analysis with stimulating stories from the front lines of business, politics, health care, government, and education. The remedy isn’t an advanced degree, nor is it common sense. You need Numbersense.\"Eric Siegel, founder, Predictive Analytics World, and author, Predictive Analytics\n\n\"I laughed my way through this superb-useful-fun book and learned and relearned a lot.

Wolf\n\nStock photography is getting more and more popular. Predictably so with magazines, publishing houses and advertising agencies, but even more so with private persons who, for instance, buy stock photos in order to use them on their websites. For you to be a successful stock photographer, though, it takes more than just uploading your latest holiday snapshots on the website of whatever agency.\n\nIn this completely revised edition of his German-language bestseller, Robert Kneschke – a German bestselling author, well-known blogger and successful stock photographer – demonstrates what a good stock photo is all about and what you can do to make it sell. Newcomers eager to earn just a little extra money will benefit from reading the book as well as amateur photographers who have been selling photos for years and are now aiming for the professional champions league.\n\nThe book is divided in two parts: “Taking Photos” and “Selling Photos”.\n\nThe first part focuses on technical aspects of the shooting and presents perfect examples of lovely, popular and attractive images which will easily sell. It deals with Props, locations and the different ways of working with models and it gives brief overviews of stock audio and stock video. This part is supplemented with an additional chapter on US Copyright Law Basics for Photographers written by Nancy E. Wolff, a practicing lawyer for more than twenty years, Legal Counsel of the Picture Archive Council of America (PACA) and author of “The Professional Photographer’s Legal Handbook”.\n\nThe second part of the book introduces the reader into the necessary routine and workflow he or she should follow as a professional stock photographer. Keywording and statistics, though often underestimated, are essential parts of a stock photographer’s job, so Robert Kneschke deals with them extensively and thoroughly. The author also lists the most popular agencies, weighs their pros and cons and shows the various licensing models on the market. Real world examples of stock photographers and their earnings and interviews with them allow the reader an even deeper insight into the business mechanics of stock photography.\n\nIf you are looking for advice on how to find your way around as a professional in a highly competitive market and how to make money with your own photos, this classic by Robert Kneschke is the book to consult.\n\nTestimonials referring to previous editions\n\nI´ve said it before and I´ll say it again: This book is definitely THE classic on stock photography in the German-language book market.fotografr.de\n\nThis is the book for people who are serious about making money with their own photos. The author himself is making a living from taking photos and selling them. So he knows what he is writing about. I assume there are very few people who know so much about the different ways of licensing and selling with all sorts of microstock agencies involved.DigitalPhoto\n\nRobert Kneschke – quite impressively – shows in his book, that stock photography is more than just trying to sell holiday and animal photos. Going far beyond such topics as choosing the right subject and technical details of the actual shooting, the book gives professional advice on legal matters, key wording as well as well-grounded background information on how to eventually make money with your own photosChip","tags":["Design","Visual Design","Photography"]},{"id":"9780136071433","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Blown to Bits: Your Life, Liberty, and Happiness After the Digital Explosion, First Edition","authors":["Hal Abelson","Ken Ledeen","Harry Lewis"],"pages":"384","publication_date":"June 2008","description":"“If you want to understand the future before it happens, you’ll love this book. If you want to change the future before it happens to you, this book is required reading.”\n\n–Reed Hundt, former Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission\n\n \n\n“There is no simpler or clearer statement of the radical change that digital technologies will bring, nor any book that better prepares one for thinking about the next steps.”\n\n–Lawrence Lessig, Stanford Law School and Author of Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace\n\n \n\n“Blown to Bits will blow you away. In highly accessible and always fun prose, it explores all the nooks and crannies of the digital universe, exploring not only how this exploding space works but also what it means.”\n\n–Debora Spar, President of Barnard College, Author of Ruling the Waves and The Baby Business\n\n \n\n“This is a wonderful book–probably the best since Hal Varian and Carl Schultz wrote Digital Rules. The authors are engineers, not economists. The result is a long, friendly talk with the genie, out of the lamp, and willing to help you avoid making the traditional mistake with that all-important third wish.”\n\n–David Warsh, Author of Knowledge and the Wealth of Nations\n\n \n\n“Blown to Bits is one of the clearest expositions I’ve seen of the social and political issues arising from the Internet. Its remarkably clear explanations of how the Net actually works lets the hot air out of some seemingly endless debates. You’ve made explaining this stuff look easy. Congratulations!”\n\n–David Weinberger, Coauthor of The Cluetrain Manifesto and Author of Everything Is Miscellaneous: The Power of the New Digital Disorder.\n\n \n\n“Blown to Bits is a timely, important, and very readable take on how information is produced and consumed today, and more important, on the approaching sea change in the way that we as a society deal with the consequences.”\n\n–Craig Silverstein, Director of Technology, Google, Inc.\n\n \n\n“This book gives an overview of the kinds of issues confronting society as we become increasingly dependent on the Internet and the World Wide Web. Every informed citizen should read this book and then form their own opinion on these and related issues.

Miller, Senior Director for Technology Policy and Strategy, Microsoft Corporation\n\n \n\n“Most writing about the digital world comes from techies writing about technical matter for other techies or from pundits whose turn of phrase greatly exceeds their technical knowledge.

What a pleasure to see real teachers offering such excellent framework for students in a digital age to explore and understand their digital environment, code and law, starting with the insight of Claude Shannon. I look forward to you teaching in an open online school.”\n\n–Professor Charles Nesson, Harvard Law School, Founder, Berkman Center for Internet and Society\n\n \n\n“To many of us, computers and the Internet are magic. We make stuff, send stuff, receive stuff, and buy stuff. It’s all pointing, clicking, copying, and pasting. But it’s all mysterious. This book explains in clear and comprehensive terms how all this gear on my desk works and why we should pay close attention to these revolutionary changes in our lives. It’s a brilliant and necessary work for consumers, citizens, and students of all ages.”\n\n–Siva Vaidhyanathan, cultural historian and media scholar at the University of Virginia and author of Copyrights and Copywrongs: The Rise of Intellectual Property and How it Threatens Creativity\n\n \n\n“The world has turned into the proverbial elephant and we the blind men. The old and the young among us risk being controlled by, rather than in control of, events and technologies. Blown to Bits is a remarkable and essential Rosetta Stone for beginning to figure out how all of the pieces of the new world we have just begun to enter–law, technology, culture, information–are going to fit together. Will life explode with new possibilities, or contract under pressure of new horrors? The precipice is both exhilarating and frightening. Hal Abelson, Ken Ledeen, and Harry Lewis, together, have ably managed to describe the elephant. Readers of this compact book describing the beginning stages of a vast human adventure will be one jump ahead, for they will have a framework on which to hang new pieces that will continue to appear with remarkable speed. To say that this is a ‘must read’ sounds trite, but, this time, it’s absolutely true.”\n\n–Harvey Silverglate, criminal defense and civil liberties lawyer and writer\n\n \n\nEvery day, billions of photographs, news stories, songs, X-rays, TV shows, phone calls, and emails are being scattered around the world as sequences of zeroes and ones: bits. We can’t escape this explosion of digital information and few of us want to–the benefits are too seductive. The technology has enabled unprecedented innovation, collaboration, entertainment, and democratic participation.\n\n \n\nBut the same engineering marvels are shattering centuries-old assumptions about privacy, identity, free expression, and personal control as more and more details of our lives are captured as digital data.\n\n \n\nCan you control who sees all that personal information about you? Can email be truly confidential, when nothing seems to be private? Shouldn’t the Internet be censored the way radio and TV are? Is it really a federal crime to download music? When you use Google or Yahoo! to search for something, how do they decide which sites to show you? Do you still have free speech in the digital world? Do you have a voice in shaping government or corporate policies about any of this?\n\n \n\nBlown to Bits offers provocative answers to these questions and tells intriguing real-life stories.

Professional or not, images surround us in our everyday lives. What makes successful photographers stand out? What drives us to revisit the same images over and over? All images tell a story.

Award-winning philanthropy executive Edgar Villanueva draws from the traditions from the Native way to prescribe the medicine for restoring balance and healing our divides.  Though it seems counterintuitive, the philanthropic industry has evolved to mirror colonial structures and reproduces hierarchy, ultimately doing more harm than good. After 14 years in philanthropy, Edgar Villanueva has seen past the field's glamorous, altruistic façade, and into its shadows: the old boy networks, the savior complexes, and the internalized oppression among the “house slaves,” and those select few people of color who gain access. All these funders reflect and perpetuate the same underlying dynamics that divide Us from Them and the haves from have-nots. In equal measure, he denounces the reproduction of systems of oppression while also advocating for an orientation towards justice to open the floodgates for a rising tide that lifts all boats. In the third and final section, Villanueva offers radical provocations to funders and outlines his Seven Steps for Healing. With great compassion—because the Native way is to bring the oppressor into the circle of healing—Villanueva is able to both diagnose the fatal flaws in philanthropy and provide thoughtful solutions to these systemic imbalances. Decolonizing Wealth is a timely and critical book that preaches for mutually assured liberation in which we are all inter-connected.","tags":["Design","Design Process","Design Thinking"]},{"id":"9780814415092","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Wild West 2.0: How to Protect and Restore Your Online Reputation on the Untamed Social Frontier","authors":["Michael Fertik","David Thompson"],"pages":"272","publication_date":"June 2010","description":"Your reputation can be made or destroyed - in just a few clicks.","tags":["Design","Product Design","Web Design","Reputation Systems"]},{"id":"9780132476638","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"How Being a Design-Driven Company Will Get You From Good to Great","authors":["Robert Brunner","Stewart Emery","Russ Hall"],"pages":"11","publication_date":"February 2010","description":"This Element is an excerpt from Do You Matter?: How Great Design Will Make People Love Your Company (ISBN: 9780137142446) by Robert Brunner and Stewart Emery. Available in print and digital formats.\n\nBuilding the shared understandings, values, and commitments that make for a truly outstanding design- and experience-driven company.\n\nYou need a development process that centers on people and experience.

In this groundbreaking book, Frank starts right at the beginning with how to find models, find great locations, work with backgrounds (you’ll be amazed at his tricks for creating stunning backgrounds for just a few bucks), and work by yourself or with a team (stylist, hair stylist, and makeup artist) to create an image that will get your photography noticed. Then, it’s on to an in-depth look at the lighting setups and looks that made Frank famous (complete with diagrams and detailed explanations). You’ll see how Frank lights his images (you’ll be shocked at how simple most of his lighting setups are and you’ll be able to create these same setups yourself), plus he covers the critical little stuff nobody else is talking about, including: how to calibrate your monitor (and why it’s so important); how to use a color target to nail your color every single time; and why (and how) to use a light meter to get consistent, reproducible lighting each and every shoot. Frank also shares his own retouching techniques through step-by-step tutorials, and he takes you from start to finish through a number of different looks so you can see exactly how it’s done, and recreate these same looks yourself. If you’ve ever wished there was one book that covers it all, the whole process of photographing models from start to finish, not leaving anything out, then this is the book for you.","tags":["Design","Visual Design","Photography"]},{"id":"9780470449929","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Nikon® D90 Digital Field Guide","authors":["J.

Instead, it does something that virtually no other Elements book has ever done–it tells you flat-out which settings to use, when to use them, and why. If you’re looking for one of those “tell-me-everything-about-the-Unsharp-Mask-filter” books, this isn’t it. You can grab any other Elements book on the shelf, because they all do that. Instead, this book gives you the inside tips and tricks of the trade for organizing, correcting, editing, sharp¿ening, retouching, and printing your photos like a pro. You’ll be absolutely amazed at how easy and effective these techniques are–once you know the secrets. LEARN HOW THE PROS DO IT Each year Scott trains thousands of digital photographers and, almost without exception, they have the same questions and face the same problems–that’s exactly what he covers in this book.

According to the U.S. government, China accounted for nearly 80% of all IP thefts from U.S.- headquartered organizations in 2013, causing an estimated $300 billion in lost business. For European manufacturers, the loss of IP in China reduced potential profits by 20%. The effects from IP leakage are visible in counterfeited items including toys, luxury goods and automotive and aircraft parts. But IP violations go beyond products. They extend to pirated operational processes and entire business and service models. For many multinational corporations, IP leakage becomes a barrier to integrating Chinese sites and partners into global innovation activities. IP leakage frequently occurs through staff transfers or shared practices from foreign multinational corporations to local joint ventures or supply chain partners. For multinationals, this type of IP leakage is often a calculated risk worth taking. However, unintended IP leakage can affect a company’s reputation and profitability. Even worse, it can create powerful local or even global competitors. To learn about how companies are managing the China IP protection challenge, authors Andreas Schotter and Mary Teagarden studied more than 50 multinational corporations. They identified nine IP protection practices that companies can use in China. Four of the practices are defensive and externally focused; the other five are proactive and internal. Together, these practices, which operate on the strategy, legal and business intelligence layers, create what the authors call the “IP protection web,” which allows corporations to (1) expand faster within China and across other emerging markets; (2) improve performance; and (3) enhance local and global innovativeness. According the authors, most of the companies they studied learned to protect their IP through trial and error — there is no single “best” process or practice. However, the changing composition of IP risk creates a need for ongoing reconfiguration. Indeed, as Chinese companies become more skillful at absorbing leaked IP from those employees who formerly worked for international rivals, international companies must develop more sophisticated responses and develop new ways to engender loyalty.","tags":["Business","Digital Economy","E-Commerce"]},{"id":"53863MIT60223","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Trapped in the Data-Sharing Dilemma","authors":["Jan Krämer","Daniel Schnurr","Michael Wohlfarth"],"pages":"4","publication_date":"January 2019","description":"There are clear benefits for companies allowing website users to login with social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, and Google.

Vine videos (called vines) can be viewed from a user’s Vine or Twitter feed, shared via Facebook, or embedded in web pages and blogs. This makes Vine like a video version of Instagram, enabling users to “share life in motion” via social networking.\n\nThis has made Vine enormously popular, especially among the same younger users who made Instagram a hit. Just three months after its release, Vine has become the #1 free app in Apple’s U.S. App Store, and is used on 2.66% of all iOS devices  — more than any other video app. In addition, 2.8% of Twitter users are also Vine users . These numbers puts Vine’s userbase at somewhere between 4 to 6 million users, who upload more than 2,000 new videos each hour. There is no user manual for Vine, nor much in the way of online help files. Anyone wanting to get on the Vine bandwagon can use some help not just learning the basic shooting and sharing features, but also figuring out how to create more sophisticated types of vines.\n\nSams Teach Yourself Vine in 10 Minutes is a one-stop shop for everything associated with Vine, from shooting basic videos to sharing those videos socially to creating more sophisticated and artistic videos.

The premise for this book is that the brand embodies the spirit of the business and, properly understood, can enable the enterprise to raise innovation, business development and performance to new levels.\n\nBased on a proven method for deconstructing and rebuilding brands, the book outlines an alternative but stimulating, and highly effective method of putting the brand at the centre of the business.\n\nAt the heart of this approach is the Brand Dream Model. Developed and perfected over several years, the model has helped to generate breakthroughs for many of the world's leading brands and corporations. It has also been applied to educational establishments and as part of a strategy development programme for a government department.\n\nUsing deceptively simple methods based on experiential, as opposed to analytical, techniques, the Brand Dream Process reveals the past strengths of the brand, its current characteristics and future potential. When the process involves everyone from the board to the marketing department and front line staff, it also generates a shared understanding of the business, its values and goals.\n\nBrand Enigma gives you the tools to put your brand and business in a class apart from the competition.\n\n\"... for breaking the norm and looking at a brand from a team perspective, this is one of the best.

Bell","Santiago Gallino","Antoio Moreno"],"pages":"8","publication_date":"April 2018","description":"At a time when many traditional retailers are closing their physical stores, digitally native vertical brands such as Bonobos, which specializes in men's apparel, and Warby Parker, which specializes in eyeglasses, are aggressively expanding into offline locations. In this article, the authors explore two related trends: (1) the expansion of online-first retailers into offline stores that \"supercharge\" customer value and (2) the transformation of stores run by traditional, offline-first retailers from fulfillment-dominant centers into experience-dominant centers. As authors David R. Bell, Santiago Gallino, and Antonio Moreno note, as digitally native vertical brands have learned to build relationships with customers, traditional retailers have been reducing their store sizes and inventories and are attempting to improve and elevate the customer experience. \"Showroom experiences,\" they write, \"create better customers.\" When customers are exposed to the brand in a showroom, \"they are better able to resolve any uncertainty about the nondigital attributes of the retailer's product.\" Similarly, the authors say, \"showrooms create better retailers: When customers are physically present in the retail environment, observation of their behaviors can lead to meaningful insights.\"The authors developed their early insights into what customers value while working closely with Bonobos and Warby Parker. Through simulations, they saw that stores with smaller footprints and a higher level of service led to better results economically — improved margins, smoother logistics, and better control of inventory. They found that, rather than being dead, physical retail stores were very much alive with a profound shift in focus — from fulfillment to experience-oriented environments. The authors conclude that online-first retailers and traditional retailers have something to learn from each other. Offline-first retailers can benefit from copying the showroom concepts originated by online-first retailers; online-first retailers can benefit by opening more traditional stores.","tags":["Business","Digital Economy","E-Commerce"]},{"id":"53863MIT58131","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Unleashing Creativity with Digital Technology","authors":["Robert D.

E-business applications can retrieve and catalog products according to their logos. Governmental agencies can easily inspect goods using smart mobile devices that use logo recognition techniques. However, because logos are two-dimensional shapes of varying complexity, the recognition process can be challenging. Although promising results have been found for clean logos, they have not been as robust for noisy logos.\n\nLogo Recognition: Theory and Practice is the first book to focus on logo recognition, especially under noisy conditions. Beginning with an introduction to fundamental concepts and methods in pattern and shape recognition, it surveys advances in logo recognition. The authors also propose a new logo recognition system that can be used under adverse conditions such as broken lines, added noise, and occlusion.\n\nThe proposed system introduces a novel polygonal approximation, a robust indexing scheme, and a new line segment Hausdorff distance (LHD) matching method that can handle more distortion and transformation types than previous techniques. In the first stage, raw logos are transformed into normalized line segment maps. In the second stage, effective line pattern features are used to index the database to generate a moderate number of likely models. In the third stage, an improved LHD measure screens and generates the best matches. A comprehensive overview of logo recognition, the book also presents successful applications of the technology and suggests directions for future research.","tags":["Design","Branding"]},{"id":"9781118651957","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"AutoCAD 2014 For Dummies","authors":["Bill Fane","David Byrnes"],"pages":"544","publication_date":"June 2013","description":"Find your way around AutoCAD 2014 with this full-color, For Dummies guide!\n\nPut away that pencil and paper and start putting the power of AutoCAD 2014 to work in your CAD projects and designs.

Behind all the jokes, however, is a wealth of information: After showing how Dreamweaver fits into the overall Web design puzzle, Geoff quickly gets down to building a basic Web site, by teaching good, 21st century work habits and providing step-by-step instructions for building pages from the very beginning with CSS styles and library items.

The first billion dollar corporation ever formed was U.S. Steel in 1901. By the mid-twentieth century the steel mill and the automobile plant were the two pillars upon which the twentieth century industrial economy rested. Given the scale of capital and operations, vertical integration was seen to be pivotal, from the raw materials of iron ore and coal on one end of the supply chain to the myriad of finished products on the other. By the end of the twentieth century, however, things had dramatically changed. Take a look inside for a brilliant and concise history of the steel industry. The author has put together a true presentation of the economics of the industry, with an overview of how the industry operates and the environment in which it operates. This book includes a detailed discussion of the regulation of the industry; a documentation of the reasons why a rejuvenated steel industry will be critical to the economic health of the United States and Canada; and a rationale for the reemergence of the steel industry in particular, and manufacturing in general, as a vital force in the North American economy of the new millennium. It was widely perceived that the United States was moving from an industrial age into an information age, driven by high technology. That process is now being reversed. The steel industry has continuously been forced to remake itself, and this book describes those developments and dynamics.","tags":["Design","Industrial Design"]},{"id":"9780768691757","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Best Political Cartoons of the Year, 2008 Edition","authors":["Daryl Cagle","Brian Fairrington"],"pages":"288","publication_date":"November 2007","description":"The Best Political Cartoons of the Year, 2008 Edition\n\nThe Best of the Year in Editorial Cartoons\n\nAll of the top political cartoonists in the world contributed to this collection of the best cartoons of 2007, from Daryl Cagle's Professional Cartoonists Index website, the most popular cartoon site on the web (www.cagle.com).
