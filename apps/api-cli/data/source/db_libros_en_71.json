Strangers are put in an unfamiliar and unpredictable setting, where to succeed they must develop a sense of teamwork, resilience, self-confidence, and a focus on the greater good.

They show how each of us can, in our own way, use the Outward Bound philosophy to bravely face the wild unknowns in our daily lives.From training the first Peace Corps volunteers to partnering with thousands of educational institutions and corporations, Outward Bound has helped build the self-confidence and character of participants who have gone on to live richer, more fulfilling, and successful lives.

Even economists, finance specialists and market commentators are often uncertain of its causes or in the interpretation of events ongoing, or of past events that have taken place that then shaped the current situation. Typically this lack of understanding results from a lack of understanding of how European institutions work, the structure of European politics and the Eurozone, the economics of the financial system, or the relationship of debt markets to current government policies in the EU. The purpose of this book is to describe the causes and outcomes of the European debt crisis (to the date of publication) within the context of three questions most often asked about the debt crisis: (i) what happened? (ii) why did it happen? and (iii) why has the crisis been so difficult for policy-makers to address? The book attempts to answer these questions in a straightforward, scholarly and thoughtful fashion, thereby developing a wider understanding of the crisis in its entirety for the reader. The book is by no means meant to be an exhaustive treatment on any of the issues it discusses. But the approach taken should be useful for those people who wish to better understand the events of the European financial crisis over the past three years but who do not need to acquire an exhaustive background in European institutions, debt markets, history and economic policy-making. For that reason the proposed book would have appeal to undergraduate students in business, economics, politics or interdisciplinary studies looking for an approachable yet detailed overview of the crisis, for graduate classes seeking similar goals and lay-people or professionals interested generally in the topic and/or with a need to acquire a basic understanding of the topic.

It's no surprise, then, that the company has been the subject of countless magazine articles, books, and even movies. But despite the extensive coverage that has been given to the company in the years since founder Mark Zuckerberg first took Facebook live on Harvard's server, one question remains unanswered: From a business standpoint, how, exactly, did Facebook do it?\n\nHow did a college student with no real-world business experience take a relatively simple idea and then, less than ten years later, turn it into a $100 billion dollar company? What specific steps did Facebook take along its journey to creating perhaps the most innovative startup of the 21st century? What approach did it take when pitching venture capitalists, and how did it go about forging its many strategic partnerships? And, most importantly, how can would-be founders learn and effectively utilize Facebook's unique techniques and strategies in their own startup efforts? In How to Create the Next Facebook, tech guru Tom Taulli answers all of these questions and more, crystallizing the process by which Facebook was shepherded from idea to IPO to provide a guided blueprint for budding entrepreneurs who are ready to start building their own great business.\n\nRegardless of what stage of development your startup is in, How to Create the Next Facebook provides you with clear, compelling, and ultimately actionable advice extracted from Facebook's startup success story. You'll learn how Facebook handled the very same situations your startup is confronting—from how it arrived at its mission statement to what its priorities were during its talent search process—before gaining access to all the concrete, practical guidance you need to make the right decisions for your company and continue moving forward with confidence. And, of course, because Facebook didn't get everything right at first, author Tom Taulli painstakingly details the company's most costly mistakes, documenting everything from its protracted legal struggles to its many failed attempts at establishing multiple revenue streams, so that you can arm your company against the various challenges that threaten to sink even the very best startups.\n\nBy the time you turn the final pages of How to Create the Next Facebook, you'll realize that Facebook is more than just a fun place to catch up with old friends; it is the ideal model to follow for those who, like you, are ready to build the world's next great startup.\n\nWhat you'll learn\n\nAfter reading this book, you will be able to:\n\nCapitalize on the Facebook phenomenon and understand how top startups are built.\n\nAvoid the most common pitfalls that cripple young ventures and improve your startup's chances at long-term success.\n\nUncover innovative ways to boost your startup's growth and learn the importance of developing multiple revenue streams.\n\nUnderstand the startup financing process, from angel funding to the IPO.\n\nProtect yourself, your company, and your intellectual property from the competition.\n\nCreate a sustainable and profitable company with long-term growth prospects.\n\nWho this book is for\n\nHow to Create the Next Facebook is specifically designed for the more than 400 million estimated entrepreneurs worldwide who are currently in the process of developing their own company. In addition, this book will appeal to aspiring entrepreneurs of all ages who, although they have not yet begun to develop their own company, are nonetheless interested in doing so in the future. Finally, thanks to the general interest that mainstream movies, narrative books, and the site itself have generated for Facebook, those who are fascinated by the company and want to learn the ins and outs of its early business efforts will constitute a third audience.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Entrepreneurship"]},{"id":"9781394265510","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Who Says?","authors":["Joe Mechlinski"],"pages":"272","publication_date":"November 2024","description":"Why blend in when you were born to stand out?\n\nWho Says?

When people inside a company develop a shared sense of what’s going on in the world, they see new opportunities faster than their competitors. They have the courage to take a risk on something new. And they have the gut-level certitude to stick with an idea that doesn’t take off right away. People are \"Wired to Care,\" and many of the world’s best organizations are, too.\n\nIn pursuit of this idea, Patnaik takes readers inside big companies like IBM, Target, and Intel to see widespread empathy in action. But he also goes to farmers' markets and a conference on world religions. He dives deep into the catacombs of the human brain to find the biological sources of empathy. And he spends time on both sides of the political aisle, with James Carville, the Ragin’ Cajun, and John McCain, a national hero, to show how empathy can give you the acuity to cut through a morass of contradictory information.\n\nWired to Care is a compelling tale of the power that people have to see the world through each other’s eyes, told with passion for the possibilities that lie ahead if leaders learn to stop worrying about their own problems and start caring about the world around them. As Patnaik notes, in addition to its considerable economic benefits, increasing empathy for the people you serve can have a personal impact, as well: It just might help you to have a better day at work.","tags":["Business","Economics","Next Economy"]},{"id":"9780132102698","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Making Room for Fun in the Workplace","authors":["David Russo"],"pages":"9","publication_date":"April 2010","description":"This Element is an excerpt from 17 Rules Successful Companies Use to Attract and Keep Top Talent: Why Engaged Employees Are Your Greatest Sustainable Advantage (9780137146703) by David Russo.

The authors of this article say that the ability of a culture to support innovation depends on six key building blocks. They developed an assessment tool based on these building blocks, which can be used by managers to help make their culture more conducive to innovation.The authors say the six basic building blocks of an innovative corporate culture are values, behaviors, climate, resources, processes and success. Values drive priorities and decisions, which are reflected in how a company spends its time and money. Behaviors involve how people act in the cause of innovation. Climate is the tenor of workplace life. An innovative climate cultivates enthusiasm, challenges people to take risks within a safe environment, fosters learning and encourages independent thinking. Resources are comprised of three main factors: people, systems and projects. Of these, people — especially “innovation champions” — are the most critical, because they have a powerful impact on the company’s values and climate. Processes are the routes innovations follow as they are developed. Finally, the internal and external success of an innovation drives many actions and decisions that may have an impact on the next one: who will be rewarded, which people will be hired and which projects will get the green light.After exploring this framework, the authors offer examples of companies that exemplify each quality. They also include a 54-element test they developed to enable managers to assess a company’s “Innovation Quotient.” Over the past three years, more than 1,000 employees in 15 companies around the world have taken this assessment. The authors give examples of companies that have implemented changes to make their culture more innovative based on what they learned from the survey, and a case study outlines the experience of a Latin American company with the assessment tool.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Innovation"]},{"id":"9780134763996","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"iPad and iPhone Tips and Tricks: Covers all iPhones and iPads running iOS 11, 7th Edition","authors":["Jason R.

Finding productive ways to work across the generation gap is essential, and the organizations that do this well will have significant strategic advantages over those that don’t. Millennials & Management: The Essential Guide to Making It Work at Work addresses a very real concern of large and small businesses nationwide: how to motivate, collaborate with, and manage the millennial generation—who now make up almost 50% of the American workforce. The key is to change our attitude from one of disbelief and derision to acceptance and respect without giving up our work standards. Using real-world examples, author Lee Caraher gives leaders data-driven steps to take to co-create a productive workplace for today and tomorrow.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Culture in Business"]},{"id":"9780132563741","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Managing Your Personal Finances Better","authors":["Trent Hamm"],"pages":"10","publication_date":"July 2010","description":"This Element is an excerpt from The Simple Dollar: How One Man Wiped Out His Debts and Achieved the Life of His Dreams (9780137054251) by Trent Hamm.

A new girls’ network is alive and set to hyperdrive.\n\nStiletto Network is about those groups: the “Power Bitches,” “Brazen Hussies” and “S.L.U.T.S.: Successful Ladies Under Tremendous Stress.” It’s about what happens when bright, extraordinary women—from captains of industry to aspiring entrepreneurs—come together to celebrate and unwind, debate and compare notes. But it’s also about what happens when they leave the table, when the talking stops and the action starts. It’s about how they mine their collective intelligence to realize their dreams or champion a cause, how they lift up their friends and push them forward, how they join forces to ensure each woman gets what she needs—be it information, an introduction, a partnership, or a landmark deal.\n\nThis is the first book to shed light on this groundbreaking movement.

But monetizing that raw energy doesn't happen by itself. As Christopher Howard shows, building great wealth is a dual process. It begins by identifying your passion—the things you truly and deeply care about, whatever they may be. Next, passion needs to be endowed with purpose: a clearly defined vision of the future you intend to create.\n\nOnce this happens, money is simply the natural reward. When you bring the value of passion and purpose to the marketplace, financial prosperity is the instant result. It's like awakening to a new reality—not just for yourself, but for everyone who shares in your success. And make no mistake: sharing is a key element in the success of Bill Gates, Oprah Winfrey, Richard Branson, and the other billionaire entrepreneurs Chris introduces in these pages. Instant Wealth—Wake up Rich! proves that ultimate success is by no means a matter of selling out principles in order to become rich. On the contrary, it's becoming rich in order to bring that riches to the world.\n\nAs a true entrepreneur himself, Christopher Howard has put these lessons to work in the creation of his own fast-growing international business. What's worked for him—and for so many other hugely successful entrepreneurs—can work for you too.

For others, it seems like a foreign language they'll never learn – until now. Rob Jolles delivers down-to-earth solutions for anyone looking to enhance the most basic need of all; to be believed. He leverages his over 30 years of experience to equip readers with empowering and practical tools for achieving business and social success. Jolles argues that credibility is as much about attitude as it is about aptitude. So-called “soft skills” like pitch, pace, and tone of voice, are actually some of the most crucial factors in determining how people perceive us. As he puts it, “it's not the words, it's the tune” that really makes us memorable and credible. This book is about finding the necessary magic to help others believe you. It requires an unshakable belief in yourself, so Jolles starts there. With that as a solid foundation, you can move on to the specific tactics and practices that will make you credible and convincing. But these can be tough to practice in the face of the inevitable setbacks we all face, so he also offers advice on maintaining courage and confidence when doubt naturally creeps in. And he concludes with a discussion of sustaining your newfound credibility for the long haul. There isn't a soul on earth who hasn't questioned themselves at some point. And most of us are just one or two brutal rejections away from questioning all that we are. Why People Don't Believe You helps readers cultivate a robust mental framework and a set of what Jolles calls “performance skills” to tackle these doubts.

The common traits? Heart, smarts, guts, and luck.After interviewing and researching hundreds of business-builders across the globe, the authors found that every one of themfrom young founder to seasoned CEOholds a combination of these four attributes. Indeed each of us tends to be biased toward one of these traits in our decision-making, and figuring out which trait drives you will lead to greater self-awareness and likelihood of success in starting and growing a business.So are you: Heart-dominant, like renowned chef Alice Waters or Starbucks’s Howard Schultz? Smarts-dominant, like Jeff Bezos of Amazon or legendary investor Warren Buffett? Guts-dominant, like Nelson Mandela or Virgin’s Richard Branson? Or are you most defined by the luck trait, like Tony Hsieh of Zappos (and a surprisingly high proportion of other successful entrepreneurs)?Heart, Smarts, Guts, and Luck includes the first Entrepreneurial Aptitude Test (E.A.T), a simple tool to help determine your specific profile.Though no single archetype for entrepreneurial success exists, this book will help you understand which traits to dial up” or dial down” to realize your full potential, and when these traits are most and least helpful (or even detrimental) during critical points of a company lifecycle.

At each evolutionary stage, there was a project manager who was studying the how and why of everything, trying new techniques, and documenting trials, errors and successes until a specific craft was mastered, thrusting progress forward in an upward trajectory that has been carved into human history.\n\nThere are countless books and articles that focus on the practice of project management. What makes this book different is the focus placed largely on the project management processes for United States (U.S) bankers. This book starts with a look at the historical progression of project management processes but quickly focuses the material on project management processes for bankers, heavily leaning towards project managers in United States (U.S.) banks. The book also looks at the bank regulatory agencies that govern U.S. banks, regulations critical to the U.S banking system, and concludes with an overview of U.S. banking technologies and the management of a U.S. banking customer call center.\n\nThe book provides a comprehensive perspective on the U.S. banking project management processes, the regulatory agencies that govern and influence those processes, how technology, and more specifically, the development and use of artificial intelligence, will create a shift in the evolutionary trajectory of U.S. banking practices, and how U.S. banking project management practices will be at the core of how quickly and how successfully this evolution unfolds.","tags":["Business","Project & Product Management","Project Management"]},{"id":"9781951527570","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Core Concepts of Project Management","authors":["Professor David L.

Sustainability has become economic and strategic imperative with potential to create opportunities and risks for businesses.\n\nBusiness Sustainability Factors of Performance, Risk, and Disclosure examines sustainability factors of performance, risk and disclosure. The five dimensions of sustainability performance are economic, governance, social, ethical, and environmental (EGSEE).

Most simply compute every ratio they know and interpret them in a standalone manner. They are unable to thread them together to spin a meaningful story that can completely or at least substantially explain what might be happening at the firm. Decision making of any kind based on such a piecemeal approach will remain flawed. This book uses a logical, top-down approach to unraveling the underlying story of the firm. It can be used by students and working executives who have a rudimentary prior idea of financial statements as well as familiarity with the very basic financial ratios. It is a myth that only executives in the finance function need to understand financial statements. Every decision within a firm has implications for the financial statements, and the need for such knowledge increases as one goes up the corporate ladder. The book is intended to be free flowing, with minimum jargon so as to be understood and appreciated especially by non-finance executives and students of business and management.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Financial Analysis & Reporting"]},{"id":"9780137082063","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"What’s In a Presentation for You?

It illustrates how teachers can both lift people up and let them down. It proposes that the best teachers are also leaders, and the best leaders are also teachers.\n\nIn examining how to lead and teach, renowned Harvard Business School professor Thomas J. DeLong takes the reader inside his own head and heart. He notes that, as teachers, we often focus more on our inadequacies and missteps than on our strengths and unique talents. He explains why this is so by dissecting and analyzing his own experiences--using himself as a case study.\n\nThe book's goal is to help readers learn about the intricacies of teaching and managing, and to impart lessons about how teachers can create a unique teaching atmosphere. To do this, the author analyzes the process of creating a curriculum, preparing for an eighty-minute class, managing the fifteen minutes before class begins, and evaluating the nature of the teaching experience after the session concludes.\n\nAlong the way, he connects specific classroom behaviors with leadership issues--in organizations, in teams, and in personal relationships. He also asks--and answers--some provocative questions, such as:\n\nWhat happens on multiple levels when I teach or lead--with me, students, or professionals?\nWhat am I thinking and feeling as I process what students are thinking and feeling?\nHow are my internal conversations affecting how I teach and lead?\nHow do I manage my biases, including having \"favorite\" students?\nTo what extent can I use teaching methods in the arena of management?\n\nThroughout Teaching by Heart, DeLong discusses why empathy and authenticity matter. When teachers embrace this mindset, students have the opportunity to have a unique learning experience. Teachers and managers will learn how to create moments of transformation for students.\n\nWhether you're a university professor, a student, a business leader, or just someone fascinated by teaching, this book will instruct, entertain, and--hopefully--inspire.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9780857082664","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Personal Best: How to achieve your full potential","authors":["Marc Woods"],"pages":"308","publication_date":"December 2011","description":"True inspiration from a true inspiration\n\n\"...vibrant and instructional ... fresh, original and devoid of the usual sound bites and transatlantic psychobabble of many books of this genre...\"\n\n—The Independent on Sunday\n\nIt's not always easy to embrace life, to get up and go, to follow your dreams and make things happen... imagine how much more difficult it must be to achieve your dreams after suffering from cancer as a teenager and losing your leg.

Tuerck"],"pages":"136","publication_date":"September 2018","description":"This book, produced in two volumes, takes an integrative approach to the study of macroeconomics.\n\nIn that respect, the book brings the different strands of macroeconomics together into a single approach under which economic agents strive to make rational choices but, while doing so, sometimes misconstrue the data available to them. The result is imbalances between aggregate supply and aggregate demand that can cause economic contractions. These imbalances may be self-correcting, or they may become long-lived and require government intervention through the exercise of corrective monetary and fiscal policy.\n\nVolume I examines economic behavior on the assumption that economic agents correctly interpret the data before them. It thus takes a “micro foundations” approach, under which aggregate supply equals aggregate demand.\n\nVolume II allows for the possibility of myopia on the part of economic agents and for the resulting economic malperformance that can result from this myopia. It examines the short-run disparities between aggregate supply and aggregate demand that can result from ill-informed choices of individual economic agents or from a misdiagnosis of economic data by policy makers. It concludes with a review of recent U.S. economic policy.\n\nThe book aims to correct a good number of misconceptions that bedevil economic policymaking—among them the idea that protracted economic contractions necessarily call for increased government spending and lower taxes. It challenges the common understanding that government deficits raise interest rates and “crowd out” private investment.","tags":["Business","Economics"]},{"id":"9781449398699","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"iPod: The Missing Manual, 9th Edition","authors":["J.D.

As such, understanding how projects relate to business strategy and managing projects strategically is increasingly important to effective and efficient business management This book is designed as a short and concise treatise on how to go about doing that. The authors start by figuring out how the project relates to the rest of the business and environment and what separates it from other projects and functions. They go on to discuss how you can use principles of strategic management to better organize and manage the various projects you may be dealing with on a daily basis so that they are strategic in nature. In essence, this book details how to approach answering the important strategic questions in project management like—“Why is the project being implemented? How does the project relate to the major strategic goals of the organization? How do we accomplish the performance goals for the project so that they help achieve the major strategic goals of the organization?”","tags":["Business","Project & Product Management","Project Management"]},{"id":"9781633690394","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Learning in Action","authors":["David A. Garvin"],"pages":"272","publication_date":"March 2003","description":"Most managers today understand the value of building a learning organization. Their goal is to leverage knowledge and make it a key corporate asset, yet they remain uncertain about how best to get started. What they lack are guidelines and tools that transform abstract theorythe learning organization as an idealinto hands-on implementation. For the first time in Learning in Action, David Garvin helps managers make the leap from theory to proven practice. Garvin argues that at the heart of organizational learning lies a set of processes that can be designed, deployed, and led. He starts by describing the basic steps in every learning processacquiring, interpreting, and applying knowledgethen examines the critical challenges facing managers at each of these stages and the various ways the challenges can be met. Drawing on decades of scholarship and a wealth of examples from a wide range of fields, Garvin next introduces three modes of learningintelligence gathering, experience, and experimentationand shows how each mode is most effectively deployed. These approaches are brought to life in complete, richly detailed case studies of learning in action at organizations such as Xerox, L. L. Bean, the U. S. Army, and GE. The book concludes with a discussion of the leadership role that senior executives must play to make learning a day-to-day reality in their organizations.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy"]},{"id":"9780071775267","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Winning the Customer: Turn Consumers into Fans and Get Them to Spend More","authors":["Lou Imbriano"],"pages":"256","publication_date":"September 2011","description":"Build Customer Relationships and Win Big Revenue!\n\n“Unbreakable relationships are crucial to success in business.

A great presentation is more than just a slideshow–it’s about using PowerPoint to its maximum potential to get your message across to your audience. That’s the PowerPoint Predicament. Tom Bunzel reveals how to conceive, plan, develop, and deliver truly effective business, academic, and inspirational communications, not just PowerPoint slideshows. Discover how to motivate your audience by:\n\nGetting beyond bullet points to tell a story that touches your audience at the deepest levels\n\nMastering proven principles of effective communication\n\nPlanning, organizing, and designing every presentation for maximum impact\n\nMaking sure every word, image, effect, and slide exists for a good reason\n\nCreating charts and diagrams that instantly make your point\n\nUsing animation, navigation, video, and audio to drive home your message, not distract from it\n\nAvoiding mistakes that lead to boring presentations: no more “death by PowerPoint”\n\nBuilding Web and self-running kiosk presentations that really work\n\nLeveraging the rest of Microsoft Office to create even better presentations\n\nUsing third-party add-ons to communicate with PowerPoint even more effectively: video capture, flowcharting, DVD authoring, rehearsal, and more\n\nWhen you present, you’re on the line: your credibility, your career, your future as a leader. Use your software and imagination to its full potential–with this book!\n\nCovers PowerPoint 2007, 2003, XP, 2000, 99, and 97– for Windows or Mac PowerPoint users\n\nTom Bunzel is a leading presentation expert. He has appeared on Tech TV’s “Call for Help,” was a featured speaker at InfoComm and PowerPoint LIVE, and has served as a technology coach for companies ranging from Iomega to the Neuroscience Education Institute, where he provided personal PowerPoint instruction to physicians. He offers live seminars via streaming media, and he has been published in Presentations Magazine. His books include Sams Teach Yourself PowerPoint 2003 in 24 Hours and Digital Video on the PC. He updated the Visual QuickStart Guide to PowerPoint 2002/2001 for Windows and Mac.\n\nThe book companion CD-ROM contains numerous PowerPoint presentations and other examples from the book, two sample chapters from Cliff Atkinson’s Beyond Bullet Points: Using Microsoft PowerPoint to Create Presentations That Inform, Motivate, and Inspire, and trial software from Instant Effects (OfficeFX), Serious Magic (Ovation and Vlog It!), and TechSmith (Camtasia and Snag It).\n\nDeveloping a compelling PowerPoint presentation involves much more than mastering one program. It involves integrating different programs, third party tools, and hardware resources to convey a message that has been skillfully crafted. From blogs to podcasts to the rise of amateur digital photography and videography, there's ample evidence to the passion among the public for communicating effectively. You crave not a how-to manual but a frame of reference for telling your stories effectively, both in front of a group, online, and across multiple digital platforms and media.\n\nSolving the PowerPoint Predicament will walk your through three fundamental steps: (1) honing (and sticking to!) a compelling message, mastering and applying appropriate technologies, (3) integrating technology with verbal delivery skills needed for a successful presentation. This book really gives you everything you need to deliver a successful presentation that people will remember.","tags":["Business","Business / Personal Technology","Presentation Software","Microsoft Powerpoint"]},{"id":"9780132616089","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"How to Feel Rich","authors":["Farnoosh Torabi"],"pages":"15","publication_date":"October 2010","description":"This Element is an excerpt from Psych Yourself Rich: Get the Mindset and Discipline You Need to Build Your Financial Life (9780137079278) by Farnoosh Torabi.

Milevsky Ph.D.","Gail MarksJarvis"],"pages":"545","publication_date":"August 2013","description":"You must be aware of the value, potential return and risk of your human capital: your job, career and what you do for a living. Human capital is the most valuable asset that you will own over your lifecycle. You need to balance financial decisions with the characteristics of your human capital. The key trends identified in Are You a Stock or a Bond? include the decline of Defined Benefit (DB) pension provision, the continued increase in human longevity and the risk of personal inflation, and they are as relevant today as they were five years ago. The financial crisis has taught us that all types of capital -- human, financial and even social -- are key to a secure financial future. If your career has \"stock-like\" growth and risk characteristics, Milevsky helps you balance your \"portfolio\" by tilting investments towards safer \"bonds.\"\n\n¿\n\nSaving for Retirement will relieve confusion and barriers to action. It acquaints readers with people like them, and step-by-step addresses what's likely confusing them. Instead of starting with some lofty financial planning theory, it walks individuals through the process everyone goes through with IRAs and 401 (k)s -- leaving no basic questions unanswered. Instead of telling readers to open an IRA-as many books do-it tells them how to open one: where to go, what the forms mean, how to decide how to invest, the essential first steps. The book removes everything from the reader's path that typically trips people up and hits the sweet spot for everyone from aged 18 to 60. Using new figures (including troubling new projections of healthcare and long-term care costs), she helps readers calculate exactly how much money they'll need. Next, she presents optimal asset allocations for each stage of life -- and shows how these allocations would've protected typical investors through the past five tumultuous years. Packed with her readers' personal stories, this book teaches powerful professional financial planning principles -- but makes them simple enough for anyone to apply on their own.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Personal Finance"]},{"id":"9780814416099","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"The Everything HR Kit","authors":["John Putzier","David Baker"],"pages":"256","publication_date":"August 2010","description":"With The Everything HR Kit, whether you are a newcomer or a veteran, you can set up a stellar HR department from scratch.

Its stock had fallen to less than $11 per share, and it had to borrow money to pay a massive government fine. Six months later, Kusserow became its CEO. Under his leadership, Amedisys dramatically improved operations, increased its market capitalization by over tenfold, and took its place among the country’s top home care and hospice businesses.\n\nIn this inspiring in-depth case study, Kusserow explains how he achieved this stunning turnaround. In the process, he provides invaluable insights and lessons that you can use to breathe new life into your organization. Unlocking unrealized human potential that already exists within your company has the highest return of any and all strategic investments. Kusserow reveals the two key principles he relied on to turbocharge Amedisys’s human capital. First, recommitting the company to its core mission of caring for its patients. This moral imperative provides clarity and improves real-time decision-making. Second, and of equal importance, applying a Golden Rule managerial model. Treating employees well and listening intently to their observations and advice empowers them to go the extra mile for customers. These twin governing principles were essential to improving care quality and outcomes, retaining and attracting staff, and enhancing organizational performance and profitability. Under Kusserow’s leadership, Amedisys reimagined and redefined the home care industry. Its people powered its transformation.\n\nKusserow details the life and leadership lessons he’s acquired through a diverse and sometimes tumultuous career. They provide the foundation for his four-stage framework—turnaround, stability, growth, and transformation—which enabled Amedisys to become the nation’s leading and most innovative home care company. It’s a proven framework that applies to business turnarounds in any industry.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy"]},{"id":"9780814414521","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Preparing for Leadership","authors":["Donna J.

How would you build and sustain it? As a leader, you need to know. In the past, businesses made people conform to the organization’s needs. But the old paradigm has shifted. Now leaders must transform their organizations so that they attract the right people, keep them, and inspire them to do their best work. How do you create a culture people want to belong to?In this powerful and necessary follow-up to the classic Why Should Anyone Be Led by You?, leadership and organizational sages Rob Goffee and Gareth Jones identify and illuminate the six key organizational attributes to do just that.

Make work meaningful6. Make simple rulesWith vivid stories and examples from global companies, the authors illustrate the kind of strong, attractive workplace culture that leads to sustained high performance.

From newsletters to press releases, social media marketing and advertising, to virtual presentations and interactions via e-mail and instant messaging, digital writing intertwines and affects the day-to-day running of the company - yet we rarely pay enough attention to it. Typing on the screen can become particularly problematic because digital text-based communication increases the opportunities for misunderstanding: it lacks the direct audio-visual contact and the norms and conventions that would normally help people to understand each other. Providing a clear, convincing and approachable discussion, this book addresses arenas of online writing: virtual teamwork, instant messaging, emails, corporate communication channels, and social media. Instead of offering do and don't lists, however, it teaches the reader to develop a practice that is observant, reflective, and grounded in the understanding of the basic principles of language and communication. Through real-life examples and case studies, it helps the reader to notice previously unnoticed small details, question previously unchallenged assumptions and practices, and become a competent digital communicator in a wide range of professional contexts.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Communication","Technical Writing"]},{"id":"9781119800941","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Apple One For Dummies","authors":["Dwight Spivey"],"pages":"224","publication_date":"June 2021","description":"A bundle of Apple services, all in one place \nAll your favorite Apple services are available in one convenient bundle, and Apple One For Dummies helps you get the full value out of your subscription.

And here's the even better news: you'll never have to work again. When you choose to do what you are called to do, you're always doing what you want to do. Work Reimagined offers an enlightening, effective, and entertaining approach to discovering what you were born to do, no matter your age or stage of life.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Development"]},{"id":"9781119463894","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Teach Yourself VISUALLY iPad, 6th Edition","authors":["Guy Hart-Davis"],"pages":"352","publication_date":"November 2017","description":"Learn the basics and beyond with this visual guide to the iPad, iPad mini, and iPad Pro\n\nTeach Yourself VISUALLY iPad is a clear, concise, image-rich guide to getting the most out of your iPad, iPad mini, or iPad Pro running iOS 11.

Drawing upon a wealth of experience, deploying an army of anecdotes, and using eye-opening American Philanthropic survey data, the authors provide a brisk, irreverent, and supremely useful introduction to fundraising for charities and nonprofits.\n\nThe book explains the hows and whys of a variety of fundraising techniques, from direct mail to planned giving programs. It explores the benefits and pitfalls of prospect research, the keys to donor retention, and the essential elements of a healthy nonprofit culture. It gives insightful advice on making personal meetings count, soliciting foundations, and training young fundraisers. And it does so with sprightly prose and sharp observations. You'll never read another fundraising book quite like this one.\n\nExpertly deflating the pretensions of those who would make fundraising a bureaucratic and esoteric profession, Beer and Cain elucidate the practical knowledge and relationship skills that still matter more than anything else. They make an impassioned plea for the importance of civil society to American democracy and build a compelling case for fundraising as an honorable component of a healthy civic culture. Philanthropy is not about bottom lines and return on investment—successful fundraisers provide a platform for donors to affirm their ideals, values, and morals.\n\nFundraising is serious, but learning about it needn’t be a chore. The Forgotten Foundations of Fundraising is at once eminently practical and absolutely delightful.","tags":["Business"]},{"id":"9780134217529","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"My iPhone (Covers iOS 9 for iPhone 6s/6s Plus, 6/6 Plus, 5s/5C/5, and 4s), Ninth Edition","authors":["Brad Miser"],"pages":"672","publication_date":"October 2015","description":"COVERS iOS 9 for iPhone 4s, 5, 5c, 5s, 6, 6 Plus, 6s, and 6s Plus\n\nMarch 21, 2016 Update: A new iPhone SE was announced today by Apple.

Members of minority groups strive to make their organizations better for others like themselves without limiting their career paths. Socially or environmentally conscious workers seek to act on their values at firms more concerned with profits than global poverty or pollution.\n\nYet many firms leave little room for differences, and people who don't \"fit in\" conclude that their only option is to assimilate or leave. In Rocking the Boat, Debra E. Meyerson presents an inspiring alternative: building diverse, adaptive, family-friendly, and socially responsible workplaces not through revolution but through walking the tightrope between conformity and rebellion.\n\nMeyerson shows how these \"tempered radicals\" work toward transformational ends through incremental means—sticking to their values, asserting their agendas, and provoking change without jeopardizing their hard-won careers. Whether it's by resisting quietly, leveraging \"small wins,\" or mobilizing others in legitimate but powerful ways, tempered radicals turn threats to their identities into opportunities to make a positive difference in their companies—and in the world.\n\nTimely and provocative, Rocking the Boat puts self-realization and change within everyone's reach—whether your difference stems from race, gender, sexual orientation, values, beliefs, or social perspective.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Culture in Business"]},{"id":"9781605098760","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Full Steam Ahead!, 2nd Edition","authors":["Ken Blanchard","Jesse Stoner"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"April 2011","description":"NEW EDITION, REVISED AND UPDATEDThe first edition of Full Steam Ahead!—an international bestseller that was translated into twenty-two languages—pioneered the concept of vision as the vital ingredient for truly satisfying long-term success.

During times of growth, change, or opportunity—so that we know we’re headed in the right direction. We also need vision during times of uncertainty—when we’ve lost confidence in our leaders, our institutions, or ourselves. Instead of focusing on “what’s next,” we need to refocus on “what’s first.” Getting back to the basics means knowing who you are, where you’re going, and what will guide your journey—having a vision. This is the place from which we must start (or revisit) if we want to thrive. When work is meaningful and connected to what we truly desire, we tap into a productive and creative power stronger than we ever imagined.\n\nKen Blanchard and Jesse Stoner show how to create a vision for your organization, and for your own life, that will unleash your power and potential and allow you to go Full Steam Ahead!

This fact is fundamental to organizations whose leaders must often make crucial decisions: to do this they need the best available insights.In Judgment Calls, authors Tom Davenport and Brook Manville share twelve stories of organizations that have successfully tapped their data assets, diverse perspectives, and deep knowledge to build an organizational decision-making capabilitya competence they say can make the difference between success and failure. This book introduces a model that taps the collective judgment of an organization so that the right decisions are made, and the entire organization profits.Through the stories in Judgment Calls, the authorsboth of them seasoned management thinkers and advisersmake the case for the wisdom of organizations and suggest ways to use it to best advantage. Each chapter tells a unique story of one dilemma and its ultimate resolution, bringing into high relief one key to the power of collective judgment. Individually, these stories inspire and instruct; together, they form a model for building an organizational capacity for broadly based, knowledge-intensive decision making.

Business students are currently taught only technical knowledge without concern for being compassionately and holistic engaged. However, when entering the business sector these graduates encounter a world which necessitates difficult, personally challenging decisions, ones for which technical knowledge is insufficient.\n\nSuccessful, sustainable resolutions can only be expected to result from a holistic, sustainable approach which accommodates the difficulty in balancing ethical practices with the demands for ever-increasing profits.\n\nThis unique graduate textbook addresses the issue of business ethics from the perspective of an individual’s internal growth facilitated by a consideration of the principles of depth psychology, spiritual wisdom, meditation, and quantum physics, written by a CEO with an enormous business background.\n\nIt not only promotes a new ethical approach, but also addresses the implementation of this new approach in the most important business sectors as a replacement for previous ineffective codes of conduct which have failed.\n\nIt’s a must read for business students with aspirations of becoming managers or entrepreneurs in the economic sector as well as for all young professionals, managers and entrepreneurs to improve their ethical performance and sustainable success.\n\nMessage from the author\n\nThis book creates an impetus for change in a business world where unethical practices are rampant by providing a suggested a New Integral Ethics for the economy, an ethical approach based upon inner psychological and spiritual development arising from a serious consideration of Depth Psychology.\n\nReaders will learn how adoption of specific Practices, which lead to inner growth and spiritual maturity, will result in ethical, morally sound business practices not because they are mandated, but because once the SELF is actualized, you cannot do otherwise. Laws, appeals and directives which have never successfully resulted in ethical practices become unnecessary, replaced by intrinsically ethical individuals who collectively influence corporate ethical behaviour. This is a giant leap into a new dimension in our globalized, digitized economy.\n\n\"Business Ethics 3.0, by Erhard Meyer-Galow provides a much needed beacon of light to a segment of our society that seem to be sinking deeper and deeper into darkness. The term \"business ethics\", once an important topic within the business community, has slowly descended through the fog of profitable ends justifying unprincipled means to become nothing more than a self-contradictory oxymoron -- especially among large international corporations. In Business Ethics 3.0, Erhard Meyer-Galow has taken a fresh approach that appeals to individual personal growth rather than the usual proffering of academic arguments that are not implementable in the real world of relentless Machiavellian competition. Only through raising and improving individual awareness and responsibility can real long-term change have a chance of developing. Business Ethics 3.0 is on the right track with a positive and compelling message…may it succeed where the academics have failed.\"Thomas Campbell, physicist, consciousness researcher, author of My big TOE\n\nFinalist at the 2018 Humanistic Management Book Awards","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Business Ethics"]},{"id":"9781947843875","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Lead Self First Before Leading Others","authors":["Stephen K.

Some level of proficiency can be demonstrated by simply focusing on leading others. But to achieve transformational results, leading self is essential. Cultivating self-awareness and developing a life plan are key elements of leading self. And really, should not leaders demonstrate a level of self-mastery before leading others? It is time that leaders move to a deeper understanding of themselves as they operate within a world of accelerated change and increasing complexity. Although leadership performance is evidenced in outward results, decisions, and actions, the genesis of the leadership performance is an internal endeavor. Resiliency and ethical behavior are grounded by having a strong sense of purpose, established vision, and clear operating values. To the degree that the leader is consciously leading self, the quality of his or her leadership corresponds. Be it for good or evil, conscious leadership is powerful. This book makes plain the case for enhanced self-awareness, provides case studies and research support, presents the voices of several master leadership coaches, and most importantly…leads the reader through the life planning process.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9780131389977","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Easy Microsoft Office 2010","authors":["Tom Bunzel"],"pages":"312","publication_date":"June 2010","description":"SEE IT DONE.

The components of that system include aligning your workforce, communicating rapidly and effectively throughout your organization, emphasizing ethical behavior, collaborating with clients and associates, and making informed decisions to improve operations and implement changes, motivating to develop an inclusive and high-performing workplace and innovation of new products and services that expand market positions and respond to market changes.

Would you believe the way you react to these interactions likely stems from the dynamics you experienced as a child? Could it be that your childhood persona has grown into your power persona at work?In Power Genes, executive coach Maggie Craddock reveals how to kick those old habitstrying too hard to please, acting out, using manipulative methods of persuasionand tells how to use power more effectively to advance your career. Craddock identifies four power types and explains how to diagnose yours: The Pleaseryou make others feel good about themselves but need constant validation and approval from them The Charmeryou draw others in with your charm, yet trust is your Achilles heel The Commanderyou take charge of the situation and gain admiration from others, but fear any loss of control The Inspireryou are star power in action, yet your vision for the future can derail the needs of workers right nowThe book outlines a process for avoiding your type’s signature destructive reflexes and replacing them with new behaviorshelping you to interact productively with other people in the office.

But does it really feel full—or are you stretched too thin? Enter Stew Friedman, Wharton professor, adviser to leaders across the globe, and passionate advocate of replacing the misguided metaphor of “work/life balance” with something more realistic and sustainable. If you’re seeking “balance” you’ll never achieve it, argues Friedman. The idea that “work” competes with “life” ignores the more nuanced reality of our humanity—the interaction of four domains: work, home, community, and the private self. The goal is to create harmony among them instead of thinking only in terms of trade-offs. It can be done. Building on his national bestseller, Total Leadership, and on decades of research, teaching, and practice as both consultant and senior executive, Friedman identifies the critical skills for integrating work and the rest of life. He illustrates them through compelling original stories of these remarkable people: • former Bain & Company CEO and Bridgespan co-founder Tom Tierney• Facebook COO and bestselling author Sheryl Sandberg• nonprofit leader and US Navy SEAL Eric Greitens• US First Lady Michelle Obama• soccer champion-turned-broadcaster Julie Foudy• renowned artist Bruce SpringsteenEach of these admirable (though surely imperfect) people exemplifies a set of skills—for being real, being whole, and being innovative—that produce a sense of purpose, coherence, and optimism.Based on interviews and research, their stories paint a vivid picture of how six very different leaders use these skills to act with authenticity, integrity, and creativity—and they prove that significant public success is accomplished not at the expense of the rest of life, but as the result of meaningful engagement in all its parts. With dozens of practical exercises for strengthening these skills, curated from the latest research in organizational psychology and related fields, this book will inspire you, inform you, and instruct you on how to take realistic steps now toward leading the life you truly want.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Development"]},{"id":"9781625278302","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"If You Really Want to Change the World","authors":["Henry Kressel","Norman Winarsky"],"pages":"240","publication_date":"September 2015","description":"Create a world-changing venture.\n\nSilicon Valley’s latest trend for creating new ventures is based on trial and error: test market needs with new product concepts and a minimum amount of capital, expect that the product may not meet the market need, so fail fast and try another product with the hope that a product-market fit will eventually emerge.

These models take many forms, from simple spreadsheets to sophisticated computer simulations. The chief underlying reason for constructing a model is to assess the impact of a decision on business performance. Based on that assessment, model users will make recommendations and take actions. The tacit assumption is that the model captures the relevant factors at a sufficient level of detail to make accurate projections. The validity of the model thus depends on a host of judgments that the model builder makes in constructing the model—some transparent, others implicit. These judgments are what make building a computer model more of an art than a science. This book is about constructing and using computer models to help decision makers in the business world make more informed decisions. It is intended to provide useful case studies for individuals who are interested in building effective decision models—ones that will get used to drive important business decisions.
