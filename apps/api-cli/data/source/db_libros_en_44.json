Ready","Alan Mulally"],"pages":"9","publication_date":"October 2017","description":"The authors argue that it is increasingly important for business leaders to learn how to build companies that are simultaneously purpose-driven, performance-focused, and principles-led. At a time when the pace of change in business is faster than ever, they believe that building organizations with these three characteristics is no longer a choice. Being performance-driven is clearly essential to success; continuous disruption, rapid technological innovation, and turbulence require that today’s leaders build agile organizations with resilient employees in order to achieve superior performance. But focusing on results alone is not enough. Demographic, cultural, and technological changes have led to a workforce that demands a set of operating principles characterized by core values such as transparency, trust, inclusion, and real-time collaboration to help guide behaviors and decision-making in companies. Finally, studies have shown that millennials are deeply motivated by corporate social responsibility and a compelling sense of purpose. Together, these forces make the case that companies that fail to aspire to align purpose, performance, and principles will also fail to attract the best talent. Furthermore, to achieve the kind of transformations that today’s fast-moving economy often requires of businesses, executives need engaged, committed employees who have opportunities to contribute their knowledge. Purpose and principles can help engage employees in support of high performance. The authors acknowledge that while it is easy for executives to say they aspire to build companies that are simultaneously purpose-driven, performance-focused, and principles-led, it is a difficult accomplishment to achieve. There are often inherent tensions and conflicting goals associated with trying to achieve all three aims. How can executives align purpose, performance, and principles so that they can lead their organizations through major changes? The authors’ research and experience suggest the task requires not only a set of leadership skills that they describe but also five mindsets that encompass the embedded tensions that face leaders of large, complex organizations. Executives must learn to reconcile these tensions by mastering a series of five conflicting yet complementary dualities: urgency and patience; collective and individual accountability; coaching and driving performance; student and teacher; and humility and boldness. One of the authors, Alan Mulally, the former CEO of Ford Motor Co., describes the role these dualities played when he led a successful turnaround of that company.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781633435803","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Investing for Programmers","authors":["Stefan Papp"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"September 2025","description":"Maximize your portfolio, analyze markets, and make data-driven investment decisions using Python and generative AI.Investing for Programmers shows you how you can turn your existing skills as a programmer into a knack for making sharper investment choices.

Research shows that repeated experiences of intriguing, constructive failure can help students (and our own children, and anyone else we lead) develop creativity and learn more deeply. When carefully curated, failure can become a signal for learning, not the noise detracting from it. The result? Learners gain a lifelong readiness to push themselves outside of their comfort zones, using setbacks as launchpads for learning and innovation.\n\nThe evidence-based principles in this book are powerful, not only in formal schooling contexts, but also for anyone taking charge of and designing their own lifelong learning. From learning a new language or skill to setting up goals that push you past your limits, this book unpacks the science of Productive Failure and describes design principles—and specific strategies built upon them—that let you harness Productive Failure for your own benefit.\n\nLearn and understand the science of failure\nApply the research-based Productive Failure framework in classrooms, teams, groups, and organizational settings\nLearn techniques like retrieval practice, generative problem-solving, motivational hacking, culture building, and so on to deepen learning experiences\nReach new levels of critical thinking, innovation, and success by making failure the norm, not the exception, and learning how to cope with it\n\nThis fascinating and actionable book is a must for educators, parents, managers, leaders, and anyone who needs to help others (or themselves) learn how to learn.","tags":["Other","Education"]},{"id":"9781484219843","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Expert Oracle Indexing and Access Paths: Maximum Performance for Your Database","authors":["Darl Kuhn","Sam R Alapati","Bill Padfield"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"September 2016","description":"Speed up the execution of important database queries by making good choices about which indexes to create.

Leadership has since pushed it off. Henry Mintzberg aims to restore management to its proper place: front and center. “We should be seeing managers as leaders.” Mintzberg writes, “and leadership as management practiced well.” This landmark book draws on Mintzberg's observations of twenty-nine managers, in business, government, health care, and the social sector, working in settings ranging from a refugee camp to a symphony orchestra. What he saw—the pressures, the action, the nuances, the blending—compelled him to describe managing as a practice, not a science or a profession, learned primarily through experience and rooted in context.But context cannot be seen in the usual way. Factors such as national culture and level in hierarchy, even personal style, turn out to have less influence than we have traditionally thought. Mintzberg looks at how to deal with some of the inescapable conundrums of managing, such as, How can you get in deep when there is so much pressure to get things done? How can you manage it when you can't reliably measure it? This book is vintage Mintzberg: iconoclastic, irreverent, carefully researched, myth-breaking. Managing may be the most revealing book yet written about what managers do, how they do it, and how they can do it better.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781317448624","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Electronic Media, 3rd Edition","authors":["Norman J.

However, historically, eclectic ideas and approaches often clash with existing long-established notions of progress and modes of realizing social and economic change. Managing Development in a Globalized World: Concepts, Processes, Institutions explores this topic by incorporating ideas and interpretations that have previously been neglected or given inadequate attention in the discourse on developing countries. It underscores development as a continuous process that must be supported by sound policies and efficient management, supplying a wider understanding of the field.\n\nThe authors argue that the application of innovative development techniques and best practices is essential for obtaining optimum results in meeting the needs of society. They examine the style of managing development with a new perspective that links the phenomenon with changing demands and the interplay of internal/external actors and a host of stakeholders. An exploration of key sectors in development provides clear comprehension of problems and solutions.\n\nA careful synthesis of theoretical/conceptual and empirical literature, the book assesses real-world situations and provides insight into the operational dynamics of development policies, programs, and institutions. It focuses on goals, values, and dynamics of development management that are undergoing rapid changes and continue to be enhanced to alleviate poverty and improve living standards in an era of globalization and inter-regional and inter-institutional synergies.

The big problem facing managers and their organizations today is one of implementation--how to get things done in a timely and effective way. Problems of implementation are really issues of how to influence behavior, change the course of events, overcome resistance, and get people to do things they would not otherwise do. In a word, power. Managing With Power provides an in-depth look at the role of power and influence in organizations. Pfeffer shows convincingly that its effective use is an essential component of strong leadership. With vivid examples, he makes a compelling case for the necessity of power in mobilizing the political support and resources to get things done in any organization. He provides an intriguing look at the personal attributessuch as flexibility, stamina, and a high tolerance for conflictand the structural factorssuch as control of resources, access to information, and formal authoritythat can help managers advance organizational goals and achieve individual success.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781484258088","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"PCI DSS: An Integrated Data Security Standard Guide","authors":["Jim Seaman"],"pages":"549","publication_date":"May 2020","description":"Gain a broad understanding of how PCI DSS is structured and obtain a high-level view of the contents and context of each of the 12 top-level requirements.

You know you have to carve out time from your day job to build your leadership skills, but it’s easy to let immediate problems and old mind-sets get in the way. Herminia Ibarraan expert on professional leadership and development and a renowned professor at INSEAD, a leading international business schoolshows how managers and executives at all levels can step up to leadership by making small but crucial changes in their jobs, their networks, and themselves. In Act Like a Leader, Think Like a Leader, she offers advice to help you: Redefine your job in order to make more strategic contributions Diversify your network so that you connect to, and learn from, a bigger range of stakeholders Become more playful with your self-concept, allowing your familiarand possibly outdatedleadership style to evolveIbarra turns the usual think first and then act” philosophy on its head by arguing that doing these three things will help you learn through action and will increase what she calls your outsightthe valuable external perspective you gain from direct experiences and experimentation. As opposed to insight, outsight will then help change the way you think as a leader: about what kind of work is important; how you should invest your time; why and which relationships matter in informing and supporting your leadership; and, ultimately, who you want to become.Packed with self-assessments and practical advice to help define your most pressing leadership challenges, this book will help you devise a plan of action to become a better leader and move your career to the next level.

In the twenty-first century, at a time of unprecedented innovation, the United States and China are in a race to achieve technological superiority. But how will this affect long-standing trade ties and the international landscape?\n\nTechno-nationalism holds that a nation’s economic strength and its national security — even its social stability— are linked to the technological prowess of its institutions and enterprises. From artificial intelligence and biotechnology to semiconductors and quantum science, nations that fall behind in the technology race risk becoming permanent losers, with potentially catastrophic consequences. After decades of trade liberalization and free-flowing investment into China, a paradigm shift amongst a bloc of like-minded, mostly Western countries, has set in motion epic change. Techno-nationalism is reorganizing the global economy.\n\nAlex Capri, who spent decades as a trade and supply chain professional in China and throughout the world, lays out the dynamics of this change and its underlying themes, from the paradox facing U.S.-China commercial linkages to the grey zones in which states and firms must now try to coexist. He provides a realist’s perspective of both the challenges and opportunities facing international actors.\n\nRegarding the elements of techno-nationalism, Capri paints a masterful picture of the strategic decoupling of supply chains and the re-shoring of key manufacturing ecosystems such as semiconductors. He provides an illuminating account of the geopolitics of data, and the fragmentation of the digital landscape, as well as the bifurcation of financial markets, academia, and R&D around Chinese and American spheres of influence.\n\nThese themes carry through to Capri’s fascinating accounts of the modern-day space-race, and space-based Internet, undersea cables, hypersonic warfare, the AI arms race, drones, and robotics. The book’s clear explanations of semiconductors and their importance is highly useful.\n\nTECHNO-Nationalism is a must-read for business and government leaders, investors and strategists, academics, journalists, NGOs, or anyone who wants to experience a thoroughly entertaining and educational account of one the most important issues of our time.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","Political Science"]},{"id":"9781394344864","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Flow Leadership","authors":["Gaelle Devins"],"pages":"384","publication_date":"June 2025","description":"Flow Leadership: Unleash the Power of People, Purpose, and Performance\n\nRevolutionize your team's productivity, well-being, and organizational culture.\n\nIn Flow Leadership, Gaëlle Devins—experienced executive and founder of FlowFusion—delivers a groundbreaking approach to unlocking the full potential of your team.

You quickly create a strategic initiative in response and appoint your best people to make change happen. And it doesbut not fast enough. Or effectively enough. Real value gets lost and, ultimately, things drift back to the default status.Why is this scenario so frequently repeated in industries and organizations across the world? In the groundbreaking new book Accelerate (XLR8), leadership and change management expert, and best-selling author, John Kotter provides a fascinating answerand a powerful new framework for competing and winning in a world of constant turbulence and disruption.Kotter explains how traditional organizational hierarchies evolved to meet the daily demands of running an enterprise. For most companies, the hierarchy is the singular operating system at the heart of the firm. But the reality is, this system simply is not built for an environment where change has become the norm. Kotter advocates a new systema second, more agile, network-like structure that operates in concert with the hierarchy to create what he calls a dual operating system”one that allows companies to capitalize on rapid-fire strategic challenges and still make their numbers.Accelerate (XLR8) vividly illustrates the five core principles underlying the new network system, the eight Accelerators that drive it, and how leaders must create urgency in others through role modeling. And perhaps most crucial, the book reveals how the best companies focus and align their people’s energy and urgency around what Kotter calls the big opportunity.If you’re a pioneer, a leader who knows that bold change is necessary to survive and thrive in an ever-changing world, this book will help you accelerate into a better, more profitable future.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781647829803","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"HBR Daily Leader","authors":["Harvard Business Review"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"December 2024","description":"Learn, grow, and be inspired—every day.\n\nHBR Daily Leader provides 365 days' worth of insights and inspiration, an easy and enjoyable way to make your professional development a regular habit.

It includes:\n\nkey concepts from semiotics, sociology, anthropology, and other fields, briefly explained\nmajor models of friendship from antiquity to contemporary societies\nproverbs and sayings about friendship from Africa, America, Asia, and Europe\nstories about famous or forgotten friends from mythology, fiction, and real history\nsummaries of research on friendship from selected academic disciplines\nbibliographical references for further studies","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences"]},{"id":"9780415169127","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Language of Humour","authors":["Alison Ross"],"pages":"132","publication_date":"August 2005","description":"The Language of Humour:* examines the importance of the social context for humour* explores the issue of gender and humour in areas such as the New Lad culture in comedy and stand-up comedy* includes comic transcripts from TV sketches such as Clive Anderson and Peter Cook","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences"]},{"id":"9781604911121","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Leadership in Action Series: On Strategic Leadership","authors":["Stephen Rush"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"October 2011","description":"Today's turbulent business environment requires strategic leadership that is systemic, focused on the future, and oriented toward change.

They have lots of tasks to do at once, and need some cleverness to get them all done at the same time.That's why threads are seen more and more often as a new model for programming. Threads have been available for some time. The Mach operating system, the Distributed Computer Environment (DCE), and Windows NT all feature threads.One advantage of most UNIX implementations, as well as DCE, is that they conform to a recently ratified POSIX standard (originally 1003.4a, now 1003.1c), which allows your programs to be portable between them. POSIX threads are commonly known as pthreads, after the word that starts all the names of the function calls. The standard is supported by Solaris, OSF/1, AIX, and several other UNIX-based operating systems.The idea behind threads programming is to have multiple tasks running concurrently within the same program. They can share a single CPU as processes do, or take advantage of multiple CPUs when available. In either case, they provide a clean way to divide the tasks of a program while sharing data.A window interface can read input on dozens of different buttons, each responsible for a separate task. A network server has to accept simultaneous calls from many clients, providing each with reasonable response time. A multiprocessor runs a number-crunching program on several CPUs at once, combining the results when all are done. All these kinds of applications can benefit from threads.In this book you will learn not only what the pthread calls are, but when it is a good idea to use threads and how to make them efficient (which is the whole reason for using threads in the first place). The authors delves into performance issues, comparing threads to processes, contrasting kernel threads to user threads, and showing how to measure speed. He also describes in a simple, clear manner what all the advanced features are for, and how threads interact with the rest of the UNIX system.Topics include:\n\nBasic design techniques\nMutexes, conditions, and specialized synchronization techniques\nScheduling, priorities, and other real-time issues\nCancellation\nUNIX libraries and re-entrant routines\nSignals\nDebugging tips\nMeasuring performance\nSpecial considerations for the Distributed Computing Environment (DCE)","tags":["Other"]},{"id":"9780071622271","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Oracle Procure-to-Pay Guide","authors":["Melanie Cameron"],"pages":"336","publication_date":"May 2009","description":"Master Oracle E-Business Suite's Oracle Procure-to-Pay\n\nDrive better decision making and maximize asset usage with Oracle E-Business Suite's comprehensive end-to-end procurement solution.

Managing With Power provides an in-depth look at the role of power and influence in organizations. Pfeffer shows convincingly that its effective use is an essential component of strong leadership. With vivid examples, he makes a compelling case for the necessity of power in mobilizing the political support and resources to get things done in any organization. He provides an intriguing look at the personal attributessuch as flexibility, stamina, and a high tolerance for conflictand the structural factorssuch as control of resources, access to information, and formal authoritythat can help managers advance organizational goals and achieve individual success.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9780071828079","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"OCA/OCP Oracle Database 12c All-in-One Exam Guide (Exams 1Z0-061, 1Z0-062, & 1Z0-063), 2nd Edition","authors":["John Watson","Roopesh Ramklass","Bob Bryla"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"August 2015","description":"This Oracle Press certification exam guide prepares you for the new Oracle Database 12c certification track, including the core requirements for OCA and OCP certification.\n\nOCA/OCP Oracle Database 12c All-in-One Exam Guide (Exams 1Z0-061, 1Z0-062, & 1Z0-063) covers all of the exam objectives on the Installation and Administration, SQL Fundamentals, and Advanced Administration exams in detail.

To make organizational change work, you need to base it on science, not intuition. Despite hundreds of books on change, failure rates remain sky high. Are there deep flaws in the guidance change leaders are given? While eschewing the pat answers, linear models, and change recipes offered elsewhere, Paul Gibbons offers the first blueprint for change that fully reflects the newest advances in mindfulness, behavioral economics, the psychology of risk-taking, neuroscience, mindfulness, and complexity theory.\n\nChange management, ostensibly the craft of making change happen, is rife with myth, pseudoscience, and flawed ideas from pop psychology.  In Gibbons’ view, change management should be “euthanized” and replaced with change agile businesses, with change leaders at every level.  To achieve that, business education and leadership training in organizations needs to become more accountable for real results, not just participant satisfaction (the “edutainment” culture). \n\nTwenty-first century change leaders need to focus less on project results, more on creating agile cultures and businesses full of staff who have “get to” rather than “have to” attitudes. To do that, change leaders will have to leave behind the old paradigm of “carrots and sticks,” both of which destroy engagement. \n\n“New analytics” offer more data-driven approaches to decision making, but present a host of people challenges—where petabyte information flows meet traditional decision-making structures. These approaches will have to be complemented with “leading with science”—that is, using evidence-based management to inform strategy and policy decisions.\n\nIn The Science of Successful Organizational Change, you'll learn:\n\nHow the VUCA (Volatile, Uncertain, Complex, and Ambiguous) world affects the scale and pace of change in today’s businesses\n\nHow understanding of flaws in human decision-making can help leaders guide their teams toward wiser strategic decisions when the stakes are largest—including “when to trust your guy and when to trust a model” and “when all of us are smarter than one of us”\n\nHow new advances in neuroscience have altered best practices in influencing colleagues; negotiating with partners; engaging followers' hearts, minds, and behaviors; and managing resistance\n\nHow leading organizations are making use of the science of mindfulness to create agile learners and agile cultures\n\nHow new ideas from analytics, forecasting, and risk are humbling those who thought they knew the future–and how the human side of analytics and the psychology of risk are paradoxically more important in this technologically enabled world\n\nWhat complexity theory means for decision-making in the context of your own business\n\nHow to create resilient and agile business cultures and anti-fragile, dynamic business structures\n\nTo link science with your \"on-the-ground\" reality, Gibbons tells “warts and all” stories from his twenty-plus years consulting to top teams and at the largest businesses in the world. You'll find case studies from well-known companies like IBM and Shell and CEO interviews from Nokia and Barclays Bank.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9780730345374","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Leadership Results","authors":["Sebastian Salicru"],"pages":"392","publication_date":"September 2017","description":"A model for developing the leaders and delivering the leadership results the world needs\n\nLeadership Results explores the fall of traditional leadership thinking and the struggling multibillion dollar leadership development industry that is failing to deliver results, and explains the mindset, skills, ways of being and methods that will get results in the new context and evolving paradigm.

In mundane life, having a sense of humor is seen not only as a positive trait of character, but as a social prerequisite, without which a person’s career and mating prospects are severely diminished, if not annihilated. However, humor is much more than this, and so much else. In particular, humor can accompany cruelty, inform it, sustain it, and exemplify it. Therefore, in this book, we provide a comprehensive, reasoned exploration of the vast literature on the concepts of humor and cruelty, as these have been tackled in Western philosophy, humanities, and social sciences, especially psychology. Also, the apparent cacophony of extant interpretations of these two concepts is explained as the inevitable and even useful result of the polysemy inherent to all common-sense concepts, in line with the understanding of concepts developed by M.

Modern business orthodoxy has an easy answer: transform it. Hone: How Purposeful Leaders Defy Drift argues this thinking is itself in need of an overhaul. Rather than devote time to expensive, long, and often unsuccessful transformations, leaders should instead focus on holistically designing and honing the management systems that are the nervous systems of their businesses. They can take a cue from chefs and other artisans and hone their organizations. After all, honing doesn't sharpen knives; it realigns a knife's steel to its original position. Choosing and honing the set of management systems that promote an organization's desired outcomes (and uninstalling them when they are past their prime) is one of the most important things a business leader can do—and is just as much art as science.\n\nThe third in a trilogy of business strategy books written by renowned strategists and two-time Thinkers50–nominated authors Steven Goldbach and Geoff Tuff, this book explains why and how to optimally hone your organization's execution of its strategy, with highlights including:\n\nThe importance of recognizing and taking action to defy the drift that often afflicts organizations undergoing massive transformation\nGuidelines on how to design and continually reshape effective management systems to influence organizational and individual behaviors\nReframing the job of CEOs to be Chief System Designers for their organizations\nReflections on how honing principles within organizations can be used on broader societal challenges such as addressing climate change via the energy transition\n\nEngaging, pragmatic, and inspiring, Hone: How Purposeful Leaders Defy Drift earns a well-deserved spot on the bookshelves of all private, public, and nonprofit sector professionals seeking to bring new sources of advantage to their organizations in a time of accelerating uncertainty and exponential change.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9780814415078","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Commercial Mortgages 101: Everything You Need to Know to Create a Winning Loan Request Package","authors":["Michael Reinhard"],"pages":"239","publication_date":"May 2010","description":"A practical guide to commercial real estate finance and commercial mortgages.","tags":["Other","Real Estate"]},{"id":"9780071779722","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Oracle E-Business Suite Financials Handbook 3/E, 3rd Edition","authors":["Ben Prusinski","Gustavo Gonzalez"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"December 2012","description":"Implement the Full Spectrum of Oracle E-Business Suite Financial Applications\n\nMaintain an integrated, customer-focused financial computing framework that meets global business requirements while lowering total cost of ownership.

It is often said that a database administrator's #1 job responsibility is to be able to recover from data loss. If you're new to the Oracle platform, or you're new to database administration in general, you can hardly go wrong by making it your first priority to learn to backup and recover the database that has been entrusted into your hands.\n\nThis book is short and sweet at just 200 pages. Focus lies on the mainstream use cases. Recovery Manager, or RMAN as it is called, is a powerful and complex tool that can be intimidating at first. Author Darl Kuhn understands the need to focus on the core use cases, building your confidence in the tool, and in your ability to recover from lost database files, and even to recover your entire database should that become necessary.\n\nOracle RMAN for Absolute Beginners shows how to backup your database. That's the first job. You'll learn to backup the entire database, and to create incremental backups that in turn can speed restore and recovery operations. Then you'll learn to recover from lost data files, lost redo log files, lost control files, and even to restore the entire database from scratch. You'll even learn how to clone a database for development and test purposes by backing the database up on one system and restoring it onto another.\n\nAuthor Darl Kuhn has a decade and a half of experience in writing about, and teaching Oracle Database backup and recovery.

They explore the lightning-rod concept of \"transparency\"-which has fast become the buzzword not only in business and corporate settings but in government and the social sector as well.\n\nTogether Bennis, Goleman, and O'Toole explore why the containment of truth is the dearest held value of far too many organizations and suggest practical ways that organizations, their leaders, their members, and their boards can achieve openness. After years of dedicating themselves to research and theory, at first separately, and now jointly, these three leadership giants reveal the multifaceted importance of candor and show what promotes transparency and what hinders it. They describe how leaders often stymie the flow of information and the structural impediments that keep information from getting where it needs to go.

Databases often grow to enormous sizes and are accessed by huge numbers of users. This growth strains the ability of single-processor and single-computer systems to handle the load. More and more, organizations are turning to parallel processing technologies to give them the performance, scalability, and reliability they need. Anyone managing a large database, a database with a large number of concurrent users, or a database with high availability requirements--such as a heavily trafficked e-commerce site--needs to know how to get the most out of Oracle's parallel processing technologies. Oracle Parallel Processing is the first book to describe the full range of parallel processing capabilities in the Oracle environment, including those new to Oracle8i. It covers:\n\nWhat is parallel processing--features, benefits, and pitfalls. Who needs it and who doesn't? What features does Oracle provide, and what are their requirements and overhead implications? The book answers these questions and presents the various parallel architectures (SMP, or Symmetric Multiprocessing; MPP, or Massively Parallel Processing; clustered systems; and NUMA, or Non Uniform Memory Access).\n\nOracle parallel execution--Oracle supports a variety of parallel execution features in the database. The book covers the use, administration, and tuning of these features: parallel query, parallel data loading, parallel DML (Data Manipulation Language), parallel object creation (through DDL, or Data Definition Language), and parallel replication propagation.\n\nOracle Parallel Server--Oracle also provides the OPS option, which work to be spread over both multiple CPUs and multiple nodes. This book covers OPS architecture, requirements, administration, tuning, storage management, recovery, and application failover issues.\n\nOracle Parallel Processing also contains several case studies showing how to use Oracle's parallel features in a variety of real-world situations.","tags":["Data","Data Engineering","Oracle Database Solutions"]},{"id":"9781119740308","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Troubleshooting & Maintaining PCs All-in-One For Dummies, 4th Edition","authors":["Dan Gookin"],"pages":"464","publication_date":"March 2021","description":"Show your PC who’s boss  \n\nNothing’s more annoying than a tech malfunction, especially when it’s your PC—with the exception of perhaps wading through reams of random, unreliable theories online looking for a solution, or paying an expensive tech geek to show up to perform a five-minute fix. The latest edition of Troubleshooting & Maintaining Your PC All-in-One For Dummies puts all this frustration behind you and gets you straight to work solving the problem yourself! \n\nIn his straightforward, friendly style, Dan Gookin—bestselling tech author and all-round Mr. Fixit—packs everything you need to know into 5-books-in-1, giving you the knowledge and process to hit on the right solution, fast.

His ideas on management, innovation, leadership, effectiveness, and adapting to change formed the foundations of modern business wisdom. Drucker was also a mentor to many notable leaders in business, government, and nonprofits, a role he valued tremendously. In A Year with Peter Drucker, you will get to experience his mentorship process firsthand as his longtime collaborator Joseph A. Maciariello leads you from week to week, lesson to lesson, using previously unpublished material and selected readings from Drucker's classic works to highlight critical lessons in leadership, personal effectiveness, and mission-driven strategy. It features examples from the individuals and organizations that Drucker helped to guide to success, including his work assisting leaders in creating some of the world's most influential religious organizations.\n\nJoseph A. Maciariello has distilled the essence of Drucker's personal mentorship program into an easy-to-follow 52-week course. Each week contains a lesson, message, or anecdote taken from Drucker's extensive body of published and unpublished work, moving from theme to theme throughout the year. It also includes further readings and reflections on the week's subject, and deep reflection questions—or quick brainstorming prompts—to help readers incorporate the message into their day-to-day work.\n\nThe year will cover the themes Drucker felt were most important to leadership development, such as\n\nLeaders Must Set Sights on the important and not the urgent. This is a key differentiator of moving from being a functionary to being a leader.\nManagement is a Human Activity. Process must serve people, in and out of the organzation.\nThe Roadmap to Personal Effectiveness depends on a clear mission and on doing the right things, not just getting things done.\nManagement succession, especially to top positions, is a crucial decision and often a big gamble. It's worth your time to get it right.\n\nMaciariello, who worked alongside Drucker as a collaborator on a number of his books, delivers the ultimate Drucker companion—and the next best thing to being mentored by the legend himself.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9780415877152","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Terrorism, Insurgency and Indian-English Literature, 1830-1947","authors":["Alex Tickell"],"pages":"288","publication_date":"June 2013","description":"In this ground-breaking interdisciplinary study of terrorism, insurgency and the literature of colonial India, Alex Tickell re-envisages the political aesthetics of empire. Organized around key crisis moments in the history of British colonial rule such as the ‘Black Hole’ of Calcutta, the anti-thug campaigns of the 1830s, the 1857 Rebellion, anti-colonial terrorism in Edwardian London and the Amritsar massacre in 1919, this timely book reveals how the terrorizing threat of violence mutually defined discursive relations between colonizer and colonized.\n\nBased on original research and drawing on theoretical work on sovereignty and the exception, this book examines Indian-English literary traditions in transaction and covers fiction and journalism by both colonial and Indian authors. It includes critical readings of several significant early Indian works for the first time: from neglected fictions such as Kylas Chunder Dutt’s story of anticolonial rebellion A Journal of Forty-Eight Hours of the Year 1945 (1835) and Sarath Kumar Ghosh’s nationalist epic The Prince of Destiny (1909) to dissident periodicals like Hurrish Chunder Mookerji’s Hindoo Patriot (1856–66) and Shyamaji Krishnavarma’s Indian Sociologist (1905–14). These are read alongside canonical works by metropolitan and ‘Anglo-Indian’ authors such as Philip Meadows Taylor’s Confessions of a Thug (1839), Rudyard Kipling’s short fictions, and novels by Edmund Candler and E. M. Forster. Reflecting on the wider cross-cultural politics of terror during the Indian independence struggle, Tickell also reappraises sacrificial violence in Indian revolutionary nationalism and locates Gandhi’s philosophy of ahimsa or non-violence as an inspired tactical response to the terror-effects of colonial rule.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","History"]},{"id":"9780814434673","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"The Ten Golden Rules of Leadership","authors":["M.A. Soupios","Panos Mourdoukoutas"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"November 2014","description":"Skills and experience might land you a leadership position, but they don’t make you a true leader.\n\nLeadership comes from inside—and the greatest leaders first question themselves before they tackle the world around them.

In mundane life, having a sense of humor is seen not only as a positive trait of character, but as a social prerequisite, without which a person’s career and mating prospects are severely diminished, if not annihilated. However, humor is much more than this, and so much else. In particular, humor can accompany cruelty, inform it, sustain it, and exemplify it. Therefore, in this book, we provide a comprehensive, reasoned exploration of the vast literature on the concepts of humor and cruelty, as these have been tackled in Western philosophy, humanities, and social sciences, especially psychology. Also, the apparent cacophony of extant interpretations of these two concepts is explained as the inevitable and even useful result of the polysemy inherent to all common-sense concepts, in line with the understanding of concepts developed by M. Polanyi in the 20th century. Thus, a thorough, nuanced grasp of their complex mutual relationship is established, and many platitudes affecting today's received views, and scholarship, are cast aside.\n\n\"Like Aristotle and Dewey, Arnarsson and Baruchello do not define their terms at the outset, but instead they relentlessly pursue the meanings of two ordinary words that everyone vaguely understads to arrive at a critical insight into the concepts these words represent, which are both disparate and interrelated.\" - Richard Marc Rubin, President, George Santayana Society","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences"]},{"id":"9781609945664","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Positive Leadership, 2nd Edition","authors":["Kim Cameron"],"pages":"176","publication_date":"August 2012","description":"NEW EDITION, REVISED AND UPDATED\n\nBeyond Success\n\nPositive Leadership shows how to reach beyond ordinary success to achieve extraordinary effectiveness, spectacular results, and what Kim Cameron calls “positively deviant performance”—performance far above the norm.

After years of dedicating themselves to research and theory, at first separately, and now jointly, these three leadership giants reveal the multifaceted importance of candor and show what promotes transparency and what hinders it.

Your organization's culture is the key to its success. Strategic planning is essential. Your competencies should be measured and your weaknesses shored up. Leadership is a thing.\n\nThese may sound like basic truths of our work lives today. But actually, they're lies. As strengths guru and bestselling author Marcus Buckingham and Cisco Leadership and Team Intelligence head Ashley Goodall show in this provocative, inspiring book, there are some big lies--distortions, faulty assumptions, wrong thinking--that we encounter every time we show up for work. Nine lies, to be exact. They cause dysfunction and frustration, ultimately resulting in workplaces that are a pale shadow of what they could be.\n\nBut there are those who can get past the lies and discover what's real. These freethinking leaders recognize the power and beauty of our individual uniqueness. They know that emergent patterns are more valuable than received wisdom and that evidence is more powerful than dogma.\n\nWith engaging stories and incisive analysis, the authors reveal the essential truths that such freethinking leaders will recognize immediately: that it is the strength and cohesiveness of your team, not your company's culture, that matter most; that we should focus less on top-down planning and more on giving our people reliable, real-time intelligence; that rather than trying to align people's goals we should strive to align people's sense of purpose and meaning; that people don't want constant feedback, they want helpful attention.\n\nThis is the real world of work, as it is and as it should be. Nine Lies About Work reveals the few core truths that will help you show just how good you are to those who truly rely on you.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781119860396","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Leading Wisely","authors":["Manfred F.

Contrary to conventional wisdom, the biggest culprits are not video games, pop culture, or female-dominated schools biased toward girls. The real problem is that boys have been thrust into a bewildering new school environment that demands high-level reading and writing skills long before they are capable of handling them. Lacking the ability to compete, boys fall farther and farther behind. Eventually, the problem gets pushed into college, where close to 60% of the graduates are women. In a time when even cops, construction foremen, and machine operators need post-high school degrees, that’s a problem. Why Boys Fail takes a hard look at how this ominous reality came to be, how it has worsened in recent years, and why attempts to resolve it often devolve into finger-pointing and polarizing politics. But the book also shares some good news. Amidst the alarming proof of failure among boys—around the world—there are also inspiring case studies of schools where something is going right.

A new CEO transforms a near-bankrupt auto company and its infamously competitive culture becomes more collaborative and thrives—making it the only auto manufacturer to not take bailout funds.\n\nThese stories share a truth: Each leader’s personality set the course of their company’s future. We all know that IQ, education, knowledge, and technical skills are essential for professionals, but they alone are insufficient for effective leadership.

Organized around key crisis moments in the history of British colonial rule such as the ‘Black Hole’ of Calcutta, the anti-thug campaigns of the 1830s, the 1857 Rebellion, anti-colonial terrorism in Edwardian London and the Amritsar massacre in 1919, this timely book reveals how the terrorizing threat of violence mutually defined discursive relations between colonizer and colonized.\n\nBased on original research and drawing on theoretical work on sovereignty and the exception, this book examines Indian-English literary traditions in transaction and covers fiction and journalism by both colonial and Indian authors. It includes critical readings of several significant early Indian works for the first time: from neglected fictions such as Kylas Chunder Dutt’s story of anticolonial rebellion A Journal of Forty-Eight Hours of the Year 1945 (1835) and Sarath Kumar Ghosh’s nationalist epic The Prince of Destiny (1909) to dissident periodicals like Hurrish Chunder Mookerji’s Hindoo Patriot (1856–66) and Shyamaji Krishnavarma’s Indian Sociologist (1905–14). These are read alongside canonical works by metropolitan and ‘Anglo-Indian’ authors such as Philip Meadows Taylor’s Confessions of a Thug (1839), Rudyard Kipling’s short fictions, and novels by Edmund Candler and E. M. Forster. Reflecting on the wider cross-cultural politics of terror during the Indian independence struggle, Tickell also reappraises sacrificial violence in Indian revolutionary nationalism and locates Gandhi’s philosophy of ahimsa or non-violence as an inspired tactical response to the terror-effects of colonial rule.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","History"]},{"id":"9780763776473","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Knowledge-Based Systems","authors":["Rajendra Akerkar","Priti Sajja"],"pages":"354","publication_date":"August 2009","description":"A knowledge-based system (KBS) is a system that uses artificial intelligence techniques in problem-solving processes to support human decision-making, learning, and action.

If you want to take best advantage of the power and flexibility of this popular Oracle tool, you need this book. SQL*Plus is an interactive query tool that is ubiquitous in the Oracle world. It is present in every Oracle installation and is available to almost every Oracle developer and database administrator. SQL*Plus has been shipped with Oracle since at least version 6. It continues to be supported and enhanced with each new version of Oracle, including Oracle8 and Oracle8i. It is still the only widely available tool for writing SQL scripts. Despite this wide availability and usage, few developers and DBAs know how powerful SQL*Plus really is. This book introduces SQL*Plus, includes a quick reference to all of its syntax options, and, most important, provides chapters that describe, in step-by-step fashion, how to perform all of the tasks that Oracle developers and DBAs want to perform with SQL*Plus -- and maybe some they didn't realize they COULD perform with SQL*Plus. You will learn how to write and execute script files, generate ad hoc reports, extract data from the database, query the data dictionary tables, customize your SQL*Plus environment, and use the SQL*Plus administrative features (new in Oracle8i).

Leaders today must acknowledge and respond to the fundamental shifts that lay the foundation for effective leadership: From managing people to enabling success, from viewing peers as competitors to seeing them as collaborators, from applying extrinsic pressure on workers to unlocking intrinsic motivation, and from driving productivity with unquestioned authority to inspiring value creation by leading with empathy. \n\nIn this book, you will learn about the five interlocking trends that brought us the empowered workforce: The Great Resignation, the Great Refusal, the Great Reshuffle, the Great Retirement, and the Great Relocation collectively delivered the Great Reset.

In this book, the analysis of the first and second grammatical persons in Spanish media discourse illustrates an approach to linguistic structure and usage as motivated by the need to create meaning at all semiotic levels.\n\nRather than mere sets of deictic forms, persons constitute arrays of functional strategies used by speakers to develop certain representations of themselves and others. The degree of salience attributed to some participant through grammatical configuration – including features like person, way of formulation and syntactic function – strongly conditions the discursive role of that participant, as well as the communicative situation at large. Methodologically, the demonstration conjugates the analysis of quantitative usage patterns with that of specific instances of choice, in order to elucidate the stylistic potential of syntactic forms in media contexts.\n\nUnderstanding variation as the construction of meaning is essential to the scientific advancement of linguistics as an inherently social and cognitive discipline.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","Linguistics"]},{"id":"9781633697614","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Master Your Next Move, with a New Introduction","authors":["Michael D.

Are you ready?\n\nIn business, especially today, you are only as successful as your next career transition. Do well, and you'll be on the fast track to even more challenging roles. Fail, and you could irreparably harm your career--and your organization.\n\nIn his international bestseller The First 90 Days, transition guru Michael D. Watkins outlined a set of basic principles for getting up to speed quickly in new professional roles. Since that book was published Watkins has worked with thousands of leaders, helping them to accelerate their transitions. These leaders posed challenging questions on how to apply the basic principles in real-life situations. The truth that emerged: the First 90 Days framework can be applied in every transition, but the way you apply it is entirely different when you have been promoted to a higher level than it is when you are joining a new organization or taking a role in a different country.\n\nMaster Your Next Move answers a distinct need, focusing on the most common types of transitions leaders face and the unique challenges posed by each. Based on years of research, and now with a new introduction, this indispensable book explores eight crucial transitions virtually everyone encounters during their career, including promotion, leading former peers, onboarding into a new company, making an international move, and turning around a business in crisis.\n\nWith real-world examples and many practical models and tools, Master Your Next Move is your guide to surviving and thriving as you make your next move . . . and every one after that.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9783110760224","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Laughing Matters","authors":["Giorgio Baruchello","Ársæll Már Arnarsson"],"pages":"254","publication_date":"November 2023","description":"The present book addresses the background, rationale, general structure, and particular aims and arguments characterizing our third and last volume about \"humor\" and \"cruelty\".

Clifford documents the twists and turns of China’s dramatic and unforeseen rise over the last four decades. He sheds light on the delicate and fragile balance of forces at the heart of the success of China’s hybrid model, explaining how the ruling Communist Party boldly led the nation’s economic reforms as the surest way to preserve its grip on political power.\n\nFive years after this book was first published, much has changed within China and in its relationship with the world. This second edition provides extensive fresh new material. It explains how China has raised its game, moving from a catch-up mode to technological innovation in some areas, while still languishing in technology dependence in other respects. Earlier, China had shown signs that its driving spirit was faltering with its sails flapping. Under Xi Jinping, renewed energy has been injected. But at the same time Xi and his party have strongly reinforced their control across society and the economy, posing the question of whether Xi’s New Era in fact marks a retreat from the reforms.\n\nThis second edition contains two new chapters. One profiles Huawei, a national champion in advanced technology. Another focuses on China’s frictions with the world which have been fueled by a perception that its technology progress threatens US global dominance, coupled with China’s human rights record. In addition, against a background of the challenges faced by Alibaba and other firms, there is analysis of this watershed in China’s private sector’s autonomy. There is also extensive new insight into Xi Jinping’s rule.\n\nAs it celebrates its 100th anniversary in 2021, the Chinese Communist Party displays strong optimism over its continued governance of China. But that should not mask the longer-term risks to China’s development and stability if its hybrid model continues to unravel as reforms are abandoned in favor of heightened autocracy.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","Political Science"]},{"id":"9781422140840","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"John P.

This informative epistle investigates the causes of racial wealth disparity in the United States and provides solutions for addressing it. Through extensive data and historical research, anecdotes, teaching, and case studies, it presents practical ways White people can work with and help the Black community. It teaches readers that eliminating the $153,000 wealth gap between Black and White people is the solution to over 75% of our problems and offers solutions to help improve Black-White racial relations in the United States.\n\nIn straightforward language, filled with facts, stories, advice, and sometimes even humor, A Letter to My White Friends and Colleagues encourages every White person to share his/her wealth with the Black community—plain and simple. This book recommends that you spend a portion of your annual household budget with Black-owned companies. If more money is spent at Black-owned businesses, those companies can grow and create more jobs for Black people. Rogers also proposes White people make large savings deposits into Black-owned banks. These are the financial institutions that are the backbone of the Black community that provide loans to the Black community for businesses, education, automobiles, and home mortgages.\n\nAnd finally, he resolutely encourages White people to support government reparations to Black Americans who are descendants of Black men and women, who were enslaved from 1619 to 1865. Those who read the book will:\n\nUnderstand the root causes of racial disparities in America\nDiscover how you can personally contribute to reducing the inequality between Black and White people in the United States today\nGet concrete recommendations on how to redirect your spending to Black-owned institutions to help decrease the racial wealth gap\n\nThis groundbreaking book provides financial recommendations that you can put into practice today, using his helpful instructions in most of the chapters, to address the systemic inequality between White and Black Americans.

However, it has not seriously studied catastrophe. A Theory of Catastrophe develops a sociology of catastrophes, comparing natural, social and political causes and consequences, and the social theories that might offer explanations.\n\nA catastrophe is a general and systematic breakdown of social and political institutions resulting, among other things, in what we could call a catastrophe consciousness.\n\nThe Greek ‘cata-strophe’ formed the conclusion to a dramatic sequence of strophes. The cata-strophe was the final act of a drama, namely its denouement. Catastrophic denouements are without hope: genocides, military occupations, plagues, famines and earthquakes. A Theory of Catastrophe analyzes Pompeii, the Black Death, colonial genocide in North America, WWI and the Spanish Flu, and Nazi Germany and finally this century: terrorism, new wars, climate change and pandemics.\n\nAs a study of sociological theory, Bryan Turner discusses Spengler’s Decline of the West, Marxism as a theory of catastrophic capitalism, messianic movements, Weber on modernity, and risk society. He concludes by comparing optimism and pessimism, and the idea of inter-generational justice.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","Political Science"]},{"id":"9781607284253","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Measuring the Success of Learning Through Technology: A Step-by-Step Guide for Measuring Impact and ROI on E-Learning, Blended Learning, and Mobile Learning","authors":["Tamar Elkeles","Patricia Pulliam Phillips","Jack J.

The same old moves won't cut it any more. In Chess Not Checkers, Mark Miller tells the story of Blake Brown, newly appointed CEO of a company troubled by poor performance and low morale. Nothing Blake learned from his previous roles seems to help him deal with the issues he now faces. The problem, his new mentor points out, is Blake is playing the wrong game.The early days of an organization are like checkers: a quickly played game with mostly interchangeable pieces. Everybody, the leader included, does a little bit of everything; the pace is frenetic. But as the organization expands, you can't just keep jumping from activity to activity. You have to think strategically, plan ahead, and leverage every employee's specific talents—that's chess. Leaders who continue to play checkers when the name of the game is chess lose. On his journey, Blake learns four essential strategies from the game of chess that transform his leadership and his organization.

But, unfortunately, China's rapid and chaotic industrialization has put it on a collision course with the rest of the world. The Coming China Wars was the first book to systematically cover all those conflicts: political, economic, and environmental. Now, in this new edition, Dr. Peter Navarro has thoroughly updated the entire book. You'll find new chapters on the danger posed by China's flood of defective products and contaminated food; China's dramatic military expansion and the rising threat of a \"hot war\"; China's space program and its profound strategic implications; China's growing suppression of human rights and free speech; and much more. The coming China Wars will be fought over everything from decent jobs, livable wages, and advanced technologies to strategic resources...and eventually to our most basic of all needs: bread, water, and air. Unless all nations immediately address these impending conflicts, the results may be catastrophic. Like the First Edition, this book demands that we think much more deeply about how to stop the coming China Wars, laying out hard choices that must be made sooner rather than later. This new edition offers even more policy recommendations, including original contributions from several of the world's most important China experts.","tags":["Other","Politics & Global Issues"]},{"id":"9781567263480","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"From Analyst to Leader","authors":["Lori Lindbergh","Richard VanderHorst","Kathleen B.

Ira Chaleff's Courageous Follower model has facilitated healthy upward information flow in organizations for over 15 years. The Harvard Business Review called Chaleff a pioneer in the emerging field of followership—this new edition shares his latest thinking on an increasingly vital topic.The updated third edition includes a new chapter, “The Courage to Speak to the Hierarchy.” Much of Chaleff's model is based on followers having access to the leader. But today, followers can be handed questionable policies and orders that come from many levels above them—even from the other side of the world. Chaleff explores how they can respond effectively, particularly using the power now available through advances in communications technology.Everyone is a follower at least some of the time. Chaleff strips away the passive connotations of that role and provides tools to help followers effectively partner with leaders. He provides rich guidance to leaders and boards on fostering a climate that encourages courageous followership. The results include increased support for leaders, reduced cynicism and organizations saved from serious missteps.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781317502241","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Subtext","authors":["Andre Ruesch"],"pages":"230","publication_date":"August 2017","description":"This book seeks to vitalize students in the photography classroom.

He also concluded that capable leaders were those who understood and applied the system of profound knowledge.Four-Cornered Leadership: A Framework for Making Decisions examines the system of profound knowledge and identifies the competencies that set the stage for its successful application. Illustrating the relationship between leaders and followers, it analyzes each of the four pillars that support Deming's system, in relation to prevailing management and organizational theory. It describes a set of competencies based on these core principles that convey very different assumptions about people and organizations.The book supplies you with a new way to view leadership that is based on learning and continual modification in response to prevailing conditions. Highlighting the connection between the four elements and an individual’s ability to lead, it presents methods that are applicable in any organizational setting—including government, industry, and education. Presenting information in bite-sized chunks supported by charts and graphs, the book provides you with a clear understanding of:\n\nThe importance of system interdependencies\nWhy people behave as they do\nHow people learn, develop, and improve\nThe variability of work\nHow to manage interaction dynamics\n\nThe book examines the complexity of human nature and relates it to group and organizational dynamics.

As a response to this scholarly desideratum, this pioneering study analyzes neoconservative images of Europe since the 1970s on the basis of an extensive collection of sources. With fresh insight into the evolution of American images of Europe as well as into the history of U.S. neoconservatism, the book appeals to readers familiar and new to the subject matters alike. The study explores how, beginning in the early 1970s, ideas of the United States as an anti-Europe have permeated neoconservative writing and shaped their self-images and political agitation. The choice of periodization and investigated personnel enables the author to refute popular claims that widespread Euro-critical sentiment in the United Studies during the early 21st century – considerably ignited by neoconservatives – was a distinct post-Cold War phenomenon. Instead, the analysis reveals that the fiery rhetoric in the context of the Iraq War debates was merely the climax of a decade-old development.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","History"]},{"id":"1882197402","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Three Keys to Development: Defining and Meeting Your Leadership Challenges","authors":["Henry Browning","Ellen Van Van Velsor"],"pages":"29","publication_date":"March 2000","description":"During times of personal and professional growth, you feel as if your learning and development were accelerated.

Result? Chief executives are turning to their enterprise's senior leaders for help.

The breathtaking success of Japan was followed by a remarkable rise of \"four tigers\", then ASEAN founder states and then China. The Asian miracle became a commonly accepted definition of this success. In the late 1970s and especially 80s it became clear that the balance of power in the world had changed. Politicians, businessmen, scholars began to talk about \"the new Asia Pacific age\" and Asian economic model, different from and, maybe, even superior to Western capitalism. However, in 1997-98 the Asian economic crisis came and made the region a sick man. Six years before that Japan, the regional powerhouse entered more than a decade-long period of stagnation. The miracle was over. However, the crisis was overcome within a surprisingly short period of time. Naturally, the question arises: What now? What is going on in the region after the miracle and after the crisis? What is today's face of Asian capitalism and how should we view its performance?\n\nReaders interested in regional developments will find a lot of literature about miracle decades and crisis years. However, few analysts have addressed the challenging questions addressed in this book.\n\nThe authors vividly show that Asian capitalism is undergoing a radical structural transformation. These changes are directly affecting its key institutions: governments, companies, labor relations, etc. As a result Asian economic systems are becoming much closer to the Western-style, especially Anglo-Saxon capitalism, though the region retains some important specific features, especially regarding business culture.\n\nThis book is a must for business people worldwide, for all those who study the region in colleges and business schools, for people engaged in various international activities and, finally, for all those who want learn more about our world at the dawn of the new century.","tags":["Other","Politics & Global Issues"]},{"id":"01520110077SI","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Making Strategy Real: Bringing People Together toward a Common Cause","authors":["Katherine Colarelli Beatty","Laura Quinn"],"pages":"6","publication_date":"January 2007","description":"The hardest part of strategic leadership is getting people throughout the organization—from the executive team to the people on the front lines—to think and act similarly when making or carrying out strategy, even as the business environment continually places new demands on the organization.

CAN YOU REALLY LEARN TO LEAD?\n\nYou might believe that leaders are born, not made. Perhaps you think that you need to hold an important job to be a leader—that you need permission to lead. Leadership is one of the most important aspects of our society. Yet there is enormous disagreement and confusion about what leadership means and whether it can really be learned.\n\nAs leadership expert Robert Steven Kaplan explains in this powerful new book, leadership qualities are not something you either have or you don’t. Leadership is not a destination or a state of being. Leadership is about what you do, rather than who you are, and it starts with an ownership mind-set. For Kaplan, learning to lead involves three key elements:\n\nThinking like an owner\nA willingness to act on your beliefs\nA relentless focus on adding value to others\n\nKaplan compellingly argues that great organizations are built around a nucleus of people who think and act with an ownership mind-set. He believes that leadership is not a role reserved only for those blessed with the right attributes or situated in the right positions of power. Leadership is accessible to each of us—today. It requires a process of hard work, willingness to ask questions, and openness to learning.\n\nThis book aims to demystify leadership and outlines a specific regimen that will empower you to build your leadership skills. Kaplan tells real-life stories from his own experience of working with various types of leaders seeking to improve their effectiveness and make their organizations more successful. He asks probing questions, provides exercises, and suggests concrete follow-up steps that will help you develop your skills, create new habits, and move you toward reaching your unique leadership potential.\n\nWhat You Really Need to Lead will help you develop your capacity to lead by unlocking your power to think and act like an owner.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9780814432754","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Leadership 2030","authors":["Georg Vielmetter","Yvonne Sell"],"pages":"240","publication_date":"February 2014","description":"The tumultuous changes of the past decade, including China’s economic rise and the financial meltdown, were just the beginning.

Tap, Click, Read gives educators and parents the tools and information they need to help children grow into strong, passionate readers who are skilled at using media and technology of all kinds—print, digital, and everything in between.\n\nIn Tap, Click, Read authors Lisa Guernsey and Michael H. Levine envision a future that is human-centered first and tech-assisted second. They document how educators and parents can lead a new path to a place they call 'Readialand'—a literacy-rich world that marries reading and digital media to bring knowledge, skills, and critical thinking to all of our children. This approach is driven by the urgent need for low-income children and parents to have access to the same 21st-century literacy opportunities already at the fingertips of today's affluent families.With stories from homes, classrooms and cutting edge tech labs, plus accessible translation of new research and compelling videos, Guernsey and Levine help educators, parents, and America's leaders tackle the questions that arise as digital media plays a larger and larger role in children's lives, starting in their very first years of life.\n\nTap, Click, Read includes an analysis of the exploding app marketplace and provides useful information on new review sites and valuable curation tools. It shows what to avoid and what to demand in today's apps and e-books—as well as what to seek in community preschools, elementary schools and libraries. Peppered with the latest research from fields as diverse as neuroscience and behavioral economics and richly documented examples of best practices from schools and early childhood programs around the country, Tap, Click, Read will show you how to:\n\nPromote the adult-child interactions that help kids grow into strong readers\n\nLearn how to use digital media to build a foundation for reading and success\n\nDiscover new tools that open up avenues for creativity, critical thinking, and knowledge-building that today's children need\n\nThe book's accompanying website, TapClickRead.org, keeps you updated on new research and provides vital resources to help parents, schools and community organizations.","tags":["Other","Education"]},{"id":"9781118331859","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"From Smart to Wise: Acting and Leading with Wisdom","authors":["Prasad Kaipa","Navi Radjou"],"pages":"272","publication_date":"March 2013","description":"A fresh and timely approach to nurturing wise, resilient, and flexible leadership in a world of growing complexity\n\nLeaders tend to obstinately stick to the leadership style that brought them most success in the past, usually one of two extreme styles: functional leadership that focuses on operational excellence or smart leadership that focuses on growth. When a leader's focus is too functional, the organization becomes introverted and can focus too much on bottom-line profitability while missing out on top-line growth opportunities. But when leaders focus too much on smart leadership, the organization may experience quick growth but lose its effectiveness quickly.\n\nFrom Smart to Wise offers a new approach that balances the two styles to achieve a form of wise leadership that is both functional and smart. Drawing on inspiring real-life stories of historical and contemporary wise leaders such as Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, and even Mahatma Gandhi, the authors identify six characteristics of wise leaders and offer a practical framework to help readers develop their own style of wise leadership.\n\nA timely and innovative approach to leadership\n\nWritten by noted speakers who conduct dozens of keynote speeches and workshops, training thousands of people annually","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781786306715","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Objects to Learn about and Objects for Learning 1","authors":["Joel Bisault","Roselyne Le Bourgeois","Jean-Francois Themines"],"pages":"240","publication_date":"April 2022","description":"Resulting from a conference that took place in Amiens, France, in June 2019, this book examines the place and role of objects centered in teaching practices from kindergarten to university, both in the context of France and elsewhere.

The perspective is both a critique of existing growth-based models of development, which it argues have put humanity on a collision course with non-negotiable ecological limits, and a vision for a brighter future in which humans and non-humans alike can flourish. By putting an end to growth-seeking economic development and boundless energetic and material throughputs, degrowth’s proponents suggest we can build an economy that meets the material needs of people and planet for generations to come.\n\nThis handbook’s contributions signal the importance of degrowth across multiple disciplines and practices. Along the way, they grapple with some of the most critical questions, ideological assumptions, policies, and social struggles of our time.\n\nThe handbook approaches degrowth as a loosely knit and developing set of interdisciplinary propositions about what it might take to achieve a world of human and non-human flourishing. Contributors explore, challenge, and critique degrowth’s propositions and its prospects of shaping scholarly agendas, policy frameworks, and social movements. Essays consider degrowth from a variety of empirical and theoretical vantages, including urban design, architecture, political economy, political ecology, critical geography, and political theory. This integrative approach, at once critical and constructive, aims to preserve for readers the sense of possibility that has drawn people to degrowth scholarship thus far.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","Political Science"]},{"id":"9781118868447","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Serve to Be Great: Leadership Lessons from a Prison, a Monastery, and a Boardroom","authors":["Matt Tenney"],"pages":"224","publication_date":"May 2014","description":"Do you aspire to be a more effective leader who guides your team or organization to higher levels of lasting success?

Enron Ascending is the only book to date that examines in detail the first two-thirds of that iconic energy company’s life. Thus, it is the only book to date that exposes the deepest causes of Enron’s stunning collapse. Nobel economist Paul Krugman predicted that history would look upon Enron’s plummet as a greater turning point than the fall of the Twin Towers.\n\nEnron Ascending explains the shock of the company’s fall by recalling the astounding achievements of Enron’s birth, childhood, adolescence, and early maturity. It sets forth the once-celebrated but now-forgotten industry and innovation that caused the company and its reputation to soar stratospherically. At the same time, always conscious of the company’s fate, the book highlights throughout the developing habits of thought and behavior that later evolved into self-destructive acts of desperation and deceit.\n\nWritten fifteen years after the firm’s demise, Enron Ascending offers the long perspective of a uniquely positioned insider, Robert L. Bradley, Jr., the company’s director of public-policy analysis and Chairman Ken Lay’s personal speechwriter. The book also offers a library of previously unavailable information, drawn from Bradley’s innumerable corporate documents and unrepeatable interviews, which he collected in his capacity as the company’s prospective historian.\n\nMost important, however, Enron Ascending offers an antidote to the unending stories, studies, and books about Enron that are presented as just-the-facts but are in reality shaped decisively by the worldview of their authors. Bradley shows, beyond dispute, that the early habits which set precedents for Enron’s history-making demise were directly contrary to the free-market behaviors and capitalist attitudes generally blamed for Enron’s fall.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","History"]},{"id":"9781492033240","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Command and Control vs. Servant Leadership","authors":["Jean Dahl"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"July 2019","description":"The rise of the servant leader is due to a shift away from top-down managerial thinking.

Anyone who has run a company, raised a family, lead an army, or coached a team struggles to find the key to help others excel and realize their potential. It is surprising how often we resort to criticism vs. an approach that actually results in a better worker and a better person. \n\nWhat if we could speak Words of Life that transform those under our influence and ignite fires of intrinsic motivation? What if those we lead found great purpose in what they do and worked at their jobs with all their heart? Isn’t that what leaders, parents and teachers really want? Ultimately, don’t we hope to foster intrinsic motivation so that the individuals we lead become better employees, better students or better athletes? Recent discoveries of brain science and the wisdom of top CEO’s that Dr. Tim Irwin interviewed for this book give us the answers we’ve long sought.\n\nIn most organizations, the methods used to provide feedback to employees such as performance appraisal or multi-rater feedback systems, in fact, accomplish the exact opposite of what we intend. We inadvertently speak Words of Death. Brain science tells us that these methods tend to engage a natural “negativity bias” that is hardwired in us all.\n\nScience in recent years discovered that affirmation sets in motion huge positive changes in the brain. It releases certain neuro chemicals associated with well-being and higher performance. Amazingly, criticism creates just the opposite neural reaction. The most primitive part of the brain goes into hyper defense mode, compromising our performance, torpedoing our motivation and limiting access to our higher-order strengths.\n\nHow do we redirect employees who are out-of-line without engaging our natural “negativity bias?” Leaders must forever ban the term, “Constructive Criticism.” Brain science tells us that we can establish a connection between the employee’s work and his or her aspirations. This book calls for a new approach to align workers with an organization’s mission, strategy and goals, called Alliance Feedback.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781119810421","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Great Lockdown","authors":["Shivaji Das","Aroop Zutshi","Janesh Janardhanan"],"pages":"288","publication_date":"December 2021","description":"A collection of insider accounts describing the organizational impact of COVID-19\n\nIn The Great Lockdown: Lessons Learned During the Pandemic from Organizations Around the Globe, expert strategists Shivaji Das, Aroop Zutshi , and Janesh Janardhanan deliver an insightful exploration of this once-in-a-lifetime event to unearth invaluable learnings for the future.

Linguistic universals are considered in the light of cross-linguistic variation and typological (parametric) differences are investigated from the viewpoint of universal principles.\n\nThe book's main focus is the nature and structure of invariant principles and parameters (variables) and how they interact to give principled accounts to a variety of seemingly unrelated differences between English and Japanese. The contrasts between these two types of language is an ideal testing ground, since the languages are superficially different in virtually every aspect of their linguistic structures from word order and wh-movement, to grammatical agreement and case-marking systems, among many others.\n\nThese articles constitute a considerable contribution to the development of the principles-and-parameters model in its exploration and refinement of theoretical concepts and fundamental principles of linguistic theory, leading to some of the basic insights that lie behind the minimalist program.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences"]},{"id":"9780071799522","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Grateful Leadership: Using the Power of Acknowledgment to Engage All Your People and Achieve Superior Results","authors":["Judith W.

We know that financial outcomes can predict about 50 percent of a firm's market value. Intangibles like strategy, brand, talent, R&D, innovation, risk, and so on account for the rest. But leadership underlies them all. And despite how important we know it is, we've been forced to rely on subjective and unreliable ways to measure its impact—until now.In this landmark book, leadership scholar, author, and consultant Dave Ulrich proposes a “leadership capital index”—a Moody's or Standard and Poor's rating for leadership. Drawing on research from investors and business leaders, and synthesizing the work of dozens of consulting firms and leadership experts, Ulrich analyzes two broad domains, each comprising five factors. The individual domain includes personal qualities, strategic prowess, execution proficiency, interpersonal skills, and fit between the leader's style and the organization's market promises. The organizational domain encompasses a leader's ability to create customer-focused cultures, manage talent, demand accountability, use information to gain competitive advantage, and set up work processes to deal with change. Ulrich details rigorous metrics and methods for evaluating leaders on each of these factors. The result is a groundbreaking book that will be of vital interest not only to equity and debt investors but also to boards of directors, executive teams, human resource and leadership development professionals, government and ratings agencies—and of course to leaders themselves.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9780137049066","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Homebuyers Beware: Who’s Ripping You Off Now?—What You Must Know About the New Rules of Mortgage and Credit","authors":["Carolyn Warren"],"pages":"288","publication_date":"October 2009","description":"Everything you thought you knew about financing a house has changed.

This creative weapon has been directed against socio-political targets both in times of oppression and popular upheaval, such as the 2011 Tahrir Revolution. This book looks at the literary expression of Egyptian humour in the novels of Muḥammad Mustajāb, Khayrī Shalabī, and Ḥamdī Abū Julayyil, three writers who revive the comic tradition to innovate the language of contemporary fiction. Their modern tricksters, wise fools, and antiheroes play with the stereotypical traits attached to the ordinary Egyptians, while laughing at the universal contradictions of life. This ability to combine local and global culture, literary traditions and popular references, makes them a stimulating read in an intercultural perspective.\n\nCombining humour studies and literary criticism, this book examines language play and narrative creativity to understand which strategies craft Egyptian literary humour. In doing so, it sheds light on the contribution of humour to literary innovations of Egyptian fiction since the late Seventies, while adding new writers to those who are considered the masters of humour in the Arab novel.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","Political Science"]},{"id":"9780470826324","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Consumer India: Inside the Indian Mind and Wallet","authors":["Dheeraj Sinha"],"pages":"192","publication_date":"February 2011","description":"A richly insightful account of one of the most significant transformations in the world today.

Further, the book offers some perspective on internet English as well as on abiding uniformities in the lexicon and grammar of standard varieties. In the analyses of this heterogeneous growth such considerations as speakers' sociolinguistic profiles, phonological, morpho-syntactic, and lexical variables, frequencies, and typological patterns provide ample insight in the current status of English both in oral and electronic communities. The opening chapter presents a theoretical framework that argues for linguistic typology as conceptually resourceful in accommodating techniques of analysis and in distinguishing the wide arrays of English found throughout the globe. One clear function for Faces of English is that of a catalyst: to spur studies of diversities in English (and in other languages), to suggest approaches to adapt, to invite counterargument and developments in analysis.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","Linguistics"]},{"id":"9781292350882","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Change Activist: Make Big Things Happen Fast, 3rd Edition","authors":["Carmel McConnell"],"pages":"268","publication_date":"April 2022","description":"This book is for anyone wanting to make change happen in their life, in their workplace or community and possibly for a better world.

The volume seeks to focus on Covid-19 not simply as the terrain of epidemiology or public health, but as raising fundamental questions about the nature of social, economic and political processes. The problems of contemporary societies have become intensified as a result of the pandemic. Understanding the pandemic is as much a sociological question as it is a biological one, since viral infections are transmitted through social interaction. In many ways, the pandemic poses fundamental existential as well as political questions about social life as well as exposing many of the inequalities in contemporary societies. As the chapters in this volume show, epidemiological issues and sociological problems are elucidated in many ways around the themes of power, politics, security, suffering, equality and justice.\n\nThis is a cutting edge and accessible volume on the Covid-19 pandemic with chapters on topics such as the nature and limits of expertise, democratization, emergency government, digitalization, social justice, globalization, capitalist crisis, and the ecological crisis.\n\nContents\n\nNotes on Contributors\n\nPreface\n\nGerard Delanty1.

This monograph rehabilitates the idea of elites and gives it a solid theoretical footing, while relating it with the historical development of liberal thought in the west. The analysis offered in the book concentrates on the tradition of liberal political thought in France, which has consistently tackled the question of the elites, their role in society, and the process of their formation.\n\nCombining theoretical insights with practical wisdom, French liberal thinkers have seen the elite as an indispensable social category and as a vehicle for the development of human liberty. In their different prescriptive doctrines, French liberal thinkers have sought to reconcile the emergence of social elites with the requirements of social and political equality, as well as with the ongoing modernization of mores and institutions. The monograph offers a unique contribution to scholarship in modern political thought by engaging analytically with the notion of elites, as well as by offering a structured discussion on the historical development of liberalism in France.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","Political Science"]},{"id":"9781394193509","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Intentional Power","authors":["Lisen Stromberg","JeanAnn Nichols","Corey Jones"],"pages":"256","publication_date":"October 2023","description":"Intentional Power: The 6 Essential Leadership Skills for Triple Bottom Line Impact is THE playbook for modern leaders.\n\nIntentional Power: The 6 Essential Leadership Skills for Triple Bottom Line Impact explores how the transition from shareholder capitalism to stakeholder capitalism has created an urgent need for a new model of leadership; a model that enables leaders to navigate competing demands from both internal and external stakeholders including the most racially and age-diverse workforce in history, activist investors, purpose-driven customers, and global government regulators.\n\nIntentional Power argues persuasively for a more inclusive, comprehensive approach to leadership disrupting the conventional approach that has been taught for decades in business books, management courses, and by traditional leaders themselves.

Great leaders and achievers the masters, innovators, and great ones - do not owe their success to luck, birth, or environment and mindless risk taking. Rather, insight, achievement, and leadership are not the result of happenstance but of self-knowledge, training, and hard work. According to authors Swartz and Thorpe, great achievers throughout history from Michelangelo to Einstein, Madame Curie to Bill Gates, Colonel Sanders to General Eisenhower all have leadership characteristics that can be distilled into 10 key actions for extraordinary success. None of it is easy, the authors say, but following these keys to success can bring substantial rewards in every facet of life. The first keys or actions involve finding great opportunities determining one s passions and distinctive capabilities, the importance of learning, envisioning opportunities, and leveraging opportunities. The second set of actions involves mobilizing support for your ideas by understanding the complexity of and resistance to change, and thee final keys cover how to design, plan, and execute to opportunities while simultaneously developing achievement in others. In the process of exploring what differentiates extraordinary achievers from others, the authors put to rest some long-held and passionately defended notions. Mozart, for example, was not a buffoon who composed some of the world s most beloved music unthinkingly. And Madame Curie was a trained physicist, not just the technician wife of a great man. Michelangelo, arguably one of the greatest artists, engineers, and visionaries in the Western world, is especially interesting; his sculpture of David and the David and Goliath story is a central metaphor for authors: David represents everyone who goes beyond fear, who pursues a higher mission, who puts the interests of others first. David also is an inspiration to us to search for our Davids in the stone or to help other people and organizations see theirs.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9789353948252","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Express Learning - Computer Graphics and Multimedia","authors":["ITL ESL"],"pages":"350","publication_date":"December 2013","description":"Express Learning is a series of books designed as quick reference guides to important undergraduate courses.

As one of the world’s top trainers in the field of accelerated experiential learning, Ron Roberts understands this more keenly than anyone, and in The Well-Balanced Leader, he helps you re-envision your own behavior to become the best leader you can be.\n\nRoberts makes the process of finding the perfect leadership balance—what he calls egolibrium—personally enriching and easy to achieve. He begins by identifying the nine human behavioral dichotomies that most affect the quality of leadership:\n\nNonjudgmental / Judgmental\nNondefensive / Defensive\nRelinquishing Control / Controlling\nOpenness to learning / Know it all\nDoing the right thing / Doing whatever you want\nPatience / Impatience\nLetting go / Holding on\nAcceptance / Resistance\nOther-centric / Egocentric\n\nEveryone’s behaviors fall somewhere between each dichotomy. Using the activities, action steps, games, and thought exercises included for each pair, you’ll figure out exactly where your behaviors land, and then learn how to move that position in one direction or the other to find the right balance or your specific needs.\n\nWhen you transcend your personal needs and focus on the needs of others and of the organization, everyone benefits—including you. The result is not only greater job satisfaction for people at all levels, but greater productivity— regardless of the organization’s field, product, or service.\n\nThe Well-Balanced Leader gives you the tools for making the small, incremental changes in behavior that lead to big changes in awareness—and huge changes in your leadership effectiveness.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781567263091","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"The Cornerstones of Engaging Leadership","authors":["Casey Wilson"],"pages":"178","publication_date":"January 2008","description":"In the 21st Century, people are the competitive advantage.

ABT is a simple mindset management process that shows people how to make small shifts in perception and thinking to achieve great results. Cramer shows leaders how to apply ABT to shift their attention away from what is negative and learn to intentionally shine the spotlight on the positive, beneficial facts of a situation. As they make this mental shift from negative to positive aspects, they improve their optimism, empathy, and confidence. When their mindset zooms in on what is strong, valuable, and possible, what they say and do is far more likely to inspire others to action. In short, ABT helps leaders shift internally so they can excel externally.

How, exactly, does services offshoring work? Who makes a good partner? What are the public policy implications?

Robert Quinn shows how to defy convention and create organizations where people feel fully engaged and continually rewarded, where both individually and collectively they flourish and exceed expectations.The problem is that leaders are following a negative and constraining “mental map” that insists organizations must be rigid, top-down hierarchies and that the people in them are driven mainly by self-interest and fear. But leaders can adopt a different mental map, one where organizations are networks of fluid, evolving relationships and where people are motivated by a desire to grow, learn, and serve a larger goal. Using dozens of memorable stories, Quinn describes specific actions leaders can take to facilitate the emergence of this organizational culture—helping people gain a sense of purpose, engage in authentic conversations, see new possibilities, and sacrifice for the common good. The book includes the Positive Organization Generator, a tool that provides 100 real-life practices from positive organizations and helps you reinvent them to fit your specific needs.

Weinzimmer and McConoughey speak frankly about the things that are difficult to talk about – the unvarnished truths necessary to become a successful leader.\n\nBased on a groundbreaking 7-year study of what almost 1000 managers across 21 industries really think about lessons from failures\n\nIncludes exclusive interview material from CEOs at a wide range of organizations, including major firms such as Caterpillar, Priceline.com, and Allstate; startups; and entrepreneurial small businesses\n\nDrills down into failure to uncover the strategies that aspiring leaders need in order to avoid the most damning leadership mistakes: unbalanced orchestration, drama management, and reckless vanity\n\nLearning from the mistakes of others is a necessary part of the journey of effective leadership, and this book offers an indispensable guide to learning these powerful lessons—without paying the price of failure.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"53863MIT57110","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Developing the Next Generation of Enterprise Leaders","authors":["Douglas Ready","M. Ellen Peebles"],"pages":"9","publication_date":"October 2015","description":"A survey of top business executives from major international organizations found that 79% said it was extremely important to have leaders who act on behalf of the entire organization, not just their units. The rest said it was very important. Nearly 65% said they expected at least half of their senior and midlevel managers to behave as enterprise leaders — that is, executives who are as successful at serving the needs of the enterprise as they are at growing the units they head. The expectation that managers will know what’s happening elsewhere in the enterprise is rising, authors Douglas A. Ready and M. Ellen Peebles write, but few organizations have been set up to support the development of such enterprise leaders.\n\nSo how are managers learning to become effective enterprise leaders, and how can organizations encourage their development? The authors surveyed and interviewed scores of executives from the Americas, Europe, and Asia, and focused on three companies: Pfizer, Li & Fung, and Unilever. They found that regardless of the business or the location, enterprise leaders developed their capabilities in similar ways — through a combination of deliberate personal development, high-level mentoring, and opportunities afforded by their work that enabled strong unit performers to become even more effective as enterprise leaders.\n\nAccording to the authors, the essence of enterprise leadership lies in combining two often incompatible roles — those of builder and broker. That means executives need to build their unit’s vision and integrate it into the wider corporate vision, clarifying where the enterprise is going and how their teams can best contribute, both within and beyond unit boundaries. They must build unit capabilities and share resources and business know-how across units to contribute to enterprisewide organizational capability.\n\nBalancing the goals of the unit with the broader interests of the enterprise can be difficult, the authors concede. Having come up the ranks in silos, managers acquire strong building skills — not the brokering skills top leaders said they needed. From their interviews, the authors identified six components of what they present as a mindset for the successful enterprise leader: a heightened sense of place; a broad sense of context; a sharp sense of perspective; a powerful sense of community; a deep sense of purpose; and an abiding sense of resiliency.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781562865313","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Training Across Generations","authors":["Kim.

That is, until unlikely encounters with a park ranger and a home handyman, who become confidants and mentors, reveal new insights to Adam.

It reflects three foremost trends of present metaphor research, namely the communicative approach, the cognitive modelling approach and the multimodality approach. These trends are considered as areas of research emerging on the ground of the Conceptual Metaphor Theory, initiated by Lakoff. The book intends to show their concomitances as well as mark their diversifying paths. The aim is to bring about and make apparent the many connections among assumingly different trends stemming from CMT.\n\nWhereas discrepancies between communicative and conceptual perspectives might seem irredeemable, the book emphasizes and claims that the background framework of CMT provides a solid foundation for collaboration and mutual influence. Consequently, the analysis of metaphor usage in context may provide insights for cognitive modelling proposals. The analysis of cognitive configuration of conceptual domains may, in turn, illuminate our understanding of communicative decisions in discourse. The integration of multimodal metaphor analysis puts forward the idea that diverse modal manifestations of metaphor reveal the symbiosis between communicative and cognitive stances. The various subject areas and methodologies illuminate the scene of current research in the field. The poignant contributions open far reaching avenues into the realm of human thought and discourse.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences"]},{"id":"53863MIT64203","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Make Leader Character Your Competitive Edge","authors":["Mary Crossan","William (Bill) Furlong","Robert D.

What if they hadn't been?\n\nConsider the most famous music group in history. What would the world be like if the Beatles never existed? This was the question posed by the playful, thought-provoking, 2019 film Yesterday, in which a young, completely unknown singer starts performing Beatles hits to a world that has never heard them. Would the Fab Four's songs be as phenomenally popular as they are in our own Beatle-infused world? The movie asserts that they would, but is that true? Was the success of the Beatles inevitable due to their amazing, matchless talent?\n\nMaybe. It's hard to imagine our world without its stars, icons, and celebrities. They are part of our culture and history, seeming permanent and preordained. But as Harvard law professor (and passionate Beatles fan) Cass Sunstein shows in this startling book, that is far from the case. Focusing on both famous and forgotten (or simply overlooked) artists and luminaries in music, literature, business, science, politics, and other fields, he explores why some individuals become famous and others don't and offers a new understanding of the roles played by greatness, luck, and contingency in the achievement of fame.\n\nSunstein examines recent research on informational cascades, network effects, and group polarization to probe the question of how people become famous. He explores what ends up in the history books and in the literary canon and how that changes radically over time. He delves into the rich and entertaining stories of a diverse cast of famous characters, from John Keats, William Blake, and Jane Austen to Bob Dylan, Ayn Rand, and Stan Lee—as well as John, Paul, George, and Ringo.\n\nHow to Become Famous takes you on a fun, captivating, and at times profound journey that will forever change your perspective on the latest celebrity's \"fifteen minutes of fame\" and on what vaults some to the top—and leaves others in the dust.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","History"]},{"id":"9781597490733","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Wireshark & Ethereal Network Protocol Analyzer Toolkit","authors":["Jay Beale","Angela Orebaugh","Gilbert Ramirez"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"December 2006","description":"Ethereal is the #2 most popular open source security tool used by system administrators and security professionals.

The structured way is often based on the interleaving semantics, such as process algebra CCS. Since the parallelism in interleaving semantics is not a fundamental computational pattern (the parallel operator can be replaced by alternative composition and sequential composition), the parallel operator often does not occur as an explicit operator, such as in the mainstream programming languages C, C++, Java, et al.\nIntroduces algebraic properties and laws for structured parallel programming, one of the foundational concepts of Computer Science\nDiscusses modeling and verification of parallel programming language, parallel programming patterns, and distributed systems\nDemonstrates parallel programming language with its operational semantics, denotational semantics, axiomatic semantics, and their relations","tags":["Software Development","Computer Science","Parallel Computing"]},{"id":"9783111338972","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The War in Ukraine","authors":["Egle Elena Murauskaite"],"pages":"195","publication_date":"July 2024","description":"Since 2014 the conflict in Ukraine has escalated from an internal crisis into an ongoing full scale conventional war.

Work has become a grind, an endless series of tasks that lack meaning.\n\nBuilding upon her bestseller Selling with Noble Purpose, leadership expert Lisa Earle McLeod tackles the employee engagement crisis by showing leaders how to put workplace meaning front and center. McLeod, whose clients include organizations like Google, Hootsuite, and Roche, asserts that many organizations are unconsciously squandering their greatest asset—their people's passion. By putting profit before purpose, organizations eroded the very thing that makes a business great.\n\nThe narrative of profit, earnings, and bonuses was supposed to improve employee performance, but it had the opposite effect. It stripped the joy and meaning from work in ways that have a chilling effect on morale, performance, and ultimately profit.

This book provides the first systematic analysis of the ways religion contributes to diverse movements for social change. It draws on a variety of case studies, from the US and globally, to build an argument about religion’s distinctive capacity to provide logistical support, to inspire and legitimize activist practices, to connect different spatial scales, and to link big ideas to everyday experiences.\n\nThe book’s analysis rests on three foundational arguments. First and most fundamentally, it is impossible to understand movements for social change without analyzing the multiple ways that religion shapes their ideas, communities, and practices.\n\nSecond, religion is always in mutually transformative interaction with social and political forces and can never be entirely separated from them. In social movements and in the public sphere more generally, people interpret politics with values and concepts drawn from religion and understand their activism as spiritually meaningful. This challenges the assumption that religion is a largely a private matter.\n\nThird, scholars must treat religion as a relatively independent variable, which actively shapes social processes just as it is shaped by them. We cannot make sense of religion’s role in social movements without acknowledging that religious institutions and traditions have, to some extent, a life of their own.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","Political Science"]},{"id":"9781609946449","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Leadership and the Art of Struggle","authors":["Steven Snyder"],"pages":"224","publication_date":"February 2013","description":"Related skill:","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781626567825","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Leading with Character and Competence","authors":["Timothy R.

Clark. “In fact, it's the most important applied discipline in the world.” The success of any organization can be traced directly to leadership. And leadership can be learned. But too many books and development programs focus exclusively on skills. In reality, performance and ultimate credibility are based on a combination of character and competence. As Clark puts it, character is the core and competence the crust. He shows how greatness emerges from a powerful combination of the two, although in the end character is more important. A leader with character but no competence will be ineffective, while a leader with competence but no character is dangerous.Clark spotlights the four most important components of character and competence and offers a series of eloquent, inspiring, and actionable reflections on what's needed to build each one. Fundamentally, he sees leadership as influence—leaders influence people “to climb, stretch, and become.” You need character to influence positively and competence to influence effectively. This is a book for anyone, no matter where he or she is on the organization chart. Because today employees at all levels are being asked to step up, not only can everyone be a leader, everyone has to be. Clark's insights are profound, and his passion is infectious. “Leadership” he writes, “is the most engaging, inspiring, and deeply satisfying activity known to humankind. Through leadership we have the opportunity to progress, overcome adversity, change lives, and bless the race.”","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781118098387","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Credibility: How Leaders Gain and Lose It: Why People Demand it","authors":["James M.

The book develops a simple model based on goals and means, which allows us to increase our understanding and comprehension of organisations and individuals that decide to take up arms in the name of a political cause. One of the key arguments is that statehood plays a critical role for NSAAs, irrespective of their military capabilities, ideological aspirations and geographic origins. They are ‘non-state’ not by choice but because they are unable to be a ‘state’ actor. In other words, their stateless status is a matter of lack of power, not lack of will.\n\nWith the aim of shedding light on the intimate relationship between NSAAs and statehood, the book examines 25 cases from around the globe. These armed actors use violence in order to attain divergent political aims, which are segmented into two macro categories, namely territorial change (secessionists) and regime change (Marxists-Leninist, Salafi-Jihadists and far-right).","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","Political Science"]},{"id":"9781118027899","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Six Immutable Laws of Mobile Business","authors":["Philip Sugai","Marco Koeder","Ludovico Ciferri"],"pages":"201","publication_date":"January 2010","description":"Valuable lessons from Japan's mobile industry yield 6 Immutable Laws for Mobile Business globally\n\nJapan's mobile customers enjoyed better mobile devices, more content, and the most advanced functionality and services for the last 10+ years.

Arguing for the fruitfulness of a transnational as distinct from a global approach, it places the issues of circulation, articulation and the scales of remembrance at the centre of its inquiry. In the process, it sheds new light on the ways in which mediation, post-coloniality, migration and regional integration affect both the way we remember and the role of memory in contemporary societies.\n\nIn this interdisciplinary collection, humanities and social science scholars examine a rich sample of cases from the nineteenth century on, stretching across the globe from Vietnam to Europe and the Middle East, to the USA and the Pacific, and involving a wide range of cultural practices from quilting to films, from photography to heritage sites and monuments. In the process, the volume develops a new theoretical framework while proposing new methodological tools and resources for studying collective remembrance beyond the nation-state.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","Political Science"]},{"id":"9781118641354","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Bounce Forward: How to Transform Crisis into Success","authors":["Sam Cawthorn"],"pages":"288","publication_date":"August 2013","description":"An inspiring business book that shows leaders and businesspeople how to turn adversity into innovation, productivity, and profitability\n\nWhen he was just twenty-six years old, Sam Cawthorn's life changed forever.

As a result, public and private initiatives for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) have been widely endorsed by policy-makers. A key issue is the feasibility of carbon trading or other incentives to encourage land-owners and indigenous people, particularly in developing tropical countries, to conserve forests, rather than to cut them down for agricultural or other development purposes. \n\nThis book presents a major critique of the aims and policies of REDD as currently structured, particularly in terms of their social feasibility. It is shown how the claims to be able to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as well as enhance people's livelihoods and biodiversity conservation are unrealistic. There is a naive assumption that technical or economic fixes are sufficient for success. However, the social and governance aspects of REDD, and its enhanced version known as REDD+, are shown to be implausible. Instead to enhance REDD's prospects, the author provides a roadmap for developing a new social contract that puts people first.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences"]},{"id":"0131303198","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Leading Strategic Change: Breaking Through the Brain Barrier","authors":["J.

The result has been job insecurity for millions of workers, debts as far as the eye can see, and a dangerous quest for global domination. Democracy itself has been undermined and the Constitution weakened. This regime must be overturned! And, as Charles Derber demonstrates in his provocative new book, it can be. After all, Derber points out, there have been other corporate regimes in American history, although this latest version is by far the most extreme. Still, the corporate regimes of the Gilded Age and Roaring Twenties were overturned. To create regime change again, it will require bold, creative strategies, uniting progressives and conservatives in a new politics, which Derber outlines in detail. Regime Change Begins at Home exposes the many lies the corporate regime has used to maintain itself throughout its history, from the Cold War to the Iraq war, with a particular emphasis on how the Bush administration has cynically sought to, as Condelezza Rice once put it, \"capitalize on the opportunities\" presented by 9/11. Derber reveals how the Bush administration has used the so-called \"war on terror\" to frighten and distract the public. But regime change is possible. In Part III, Derber lays out the vision of a new regime, describing the social movements now fighting to achieve it, and the major new political realignment-one spanning the traditional conservative-liberal divide-that can make it happen. Derber does not minimize the difficulty of the task ahead, but he offers hope and specific, sophisticated, often surprising advice for defeating the regime and returning America to its citizens.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","History"]},{"id":"9781626566903","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Leadership Lessons from a UPS Driver","authors":["Ron Wallace"],"pages":"160","publication_date":"April 2016","description":"United Parcel Service (UPS) is a household name that customers and investors alike hold in high regard. Who hasn't been delighted by a right-on-time delivery, one of the 18 million UPS makes every day? Founded over a hundred years ago, UPS has moved steadily up the Fortune 500 while so many other corporations have disappeared. What's the company's secret? Just ask a driver!Ron Wallace was a UPS delivery driver for six years before he began rising through the ranks, ultimately becoming president of UPS International. In other companies, that might be extraordinary, but at UPS it's par for the course. UPS has a unique corporate culture. It's like a family. Package loaders call executives by their first names and vice versa. The company almost always promotes from within. Lifetime employment is common. Most employees own UPS stock. Wallace credits the company's success—and his own—to its culture of “we, not me.” As he puts it, working at UPS gave him a PhD in teamwork. Instead of writing a typical business memoir that celebrates the leader as celebrity, Wallace shares vivid stories that focus on the people he worked with, the challenges they overcame, and the simple principles and practices that make up the UPS way.

Climate change. Refugee resettlement. Global supply chains. We face a new generation of complex problems that stretch across the public and private sectors and flow over organizational boundaries. To meet the moment, we need a fresh, new approach that strengthens institutions and government agencies by breaking free from organizational boxes and rigid, top-down leadership.\n\nAs William D. Eggers, executive director of Deloitte's Center for Government Insights, and Donald F. Kettl, public management scholar, show in this indispensable book, we need a government of bridgebuilders who collaborate with partners—inside and outside government—to get the job done. These leaders manage horizontally instead of vertically; they see their role as connectors; and they identify which players have the assets needed to solve the unprecedented problems at hand.\n\nEach chapter examines one of the ten core principles of bridgebuilding and features practical tips and dynamic cases of how effective leaders have put each bridgebuilding principle to work. The book also includes a special section that helps government leaders create a hundred-day bridgebuilding plan.\n\nThroughout, Eggers and Kettl tell fascinating and instructive stories about some of today's bridgebuilders—federal, state, and local government leaders who transcend boundaries, partner across sectors, and get stuff done.\n\nTrusted and effective government has never been more important than today. Bridgebuilders provides a new model that current government decision makers—as well as young leaders who aspire to public service—can learn from and apply right now to transform government and restore public trust.","tags":["Other","Politics & Global Issues"]},{"id":"9783110470697","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Social dilemmas, institutions, and the evolution of cooperation","authors":["Ben Jann","Wojtek Przepiorka"],"pages":"582","publication_date":"September 2017","description":"The question of how cooperation and social order can evolve from a Hobbesian state of nature of a “war of all against all” has always been at the core of social scientific inquiry. Social dilemmas are the main analytical paradigm used by social scientists to explain competition, cooperation, and conflict in human groups. The formal analysis of social dilemmas allows for identifying the conditions under which cooperation evolves or unravels. This knowledge informs the design of institutions that promote cooperative behavior. Yet to gain practical relevance in policymaking and institutional design, predictions derived from the analysis of social dilemmas must be put to an empirical test. The collection of articles in this book gives an overview of state-of-the-art research on social dilemmas, institutions, and the evolution of cooperation. It covers theoretical contributions and offers a broad range of examples on how theoretical insights can be empirically verified and applied to cooperation problems in everyday life. By bringing together a group of distinguished scholars, the book fills an important gap in sociological scholarship and addresses some of the most interesting questions of human sociality.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences"]},{"id":"9781118049594","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"One Piece of Paper: The Simple Approach to Powerful, Personal Leadership","authors":["MIKE FIGLIUOLO"],"pages":"250","publication_date":"October 2011","description":"A robust, authentic model for creating and clearly articulating a personal leadership philosophy\n\nBased on leadership expert Mike Figliuolo's popular \"Leadership Maxims\" training course, One Piece of Paper teaches decisive, effective leadership by taking a holistic approach to defining one's personal leadership philosophy.

Fines and settlements have amounted to billions of dollars.

Lubanska findings offer an insight into the fact that although certain actions may appear syncretic in nature, their underlying intentions are often not in fact motivated by syncretic tendencies.

Over 16 million Palm Powered PDAs have sold over the past six years,and the number of registered Palm Developers is currently over 100,000 and growing by about a 1,000 per month. Visual Basic is one of the most popular development platformsin the world. Until recently Visual Basic developers were not able to create applications for the Palm OS platform. By integrating into the Visual Basic environment, the AppForge Basic compiler has brought Palm development right into the main tool used by millions of VB Programmers. In fact, Visual Basic in conjunction with AppForge is fast becoming one of the favorite development environments for the Palm OS. The book provides a framework for application design, development and installation for the Palm handheld. While the reader should have experience with the property-method-event model of VB programming, no familiarity with Palm products is assumed or required. It is written primarily for corporate software developers, software architects, middle-ware developers and engineering managers who need to understand the strengths and limits of programming on the Palm, and how to integrate Visual Basic language Palm applications into their corporate IT infrastructure or product offerings. It teaches readers how to create a host of business applications including security, wireless and database connectivity programs. Some of the covered topics include:\n\nComplete coverage of Palm user interface and database programming techniques\n\nData Synchronization including how to build, test and install a conduit using Visual Basic and COM\n\nWeb Clipping applications and how to interface those applications to Microsoft's Active Server Page framework.\n\nExtending the AppForge Palm application using shared libraries and Active-X like components.\n\nProgramming Visual Basic for the Palm OS is the only book designed to help the Visual Basic desktop programmer to break into the Palm market.

A third of the population, primarily in the East and South, regards its own Russian cultural identity as entirely compatible with a Ukrainian civic identity. The state’s reluctance to recognize this ethnos as a legitimate part of the modern Ukrainian nation, has created a tragic cycle that entangles Ukrainian politics.\n\nThe Tragedy of Ukraine argues that in order to untangle the conflict within the Ukraine, it must be addressed on an emotional, as well as institutional level. It draws on Richard Ned Lebow’s ‘tragic vision of politics’ and on classical Greek tragedy to assist in understanding the persistence of this conflict. Classical Greek tragedy once served as a mechanism in Athenian society to heal deep social trauma and create more just institutions. The Tragedy of Ukraine reflects on the ways in which ancient Greek tragedy can help us rethink civic conflict and polarization, as well as model ways of healing deep social divisions.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","Political Science"]},{"id":"9783111000671","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Different Shades of the Past","authors":["Mateusz Kamionka","Przemysław Łukasik"],"pages":"217","publication_date":"January 2023","description":"In his book 21 Lessons for the 21st Century the historian Yuval Noah Harrari wrote that man had the possibility to conquer the world precisely because he could create fictional stories and believe in them.

What does it take to be a real leader—one who is confident in who she is and what she stands for, and who truly inspires people to achieve extraordinary results?Rob Goffee and Gareth Jones argue that leaders don’t become great by aspiring to a list of universal character traits. Rather, effective leaders are authentic: they deploy individual strengths to engage followers’ hearts, minds, and souls. They are skillful at consistently being themselves, even as they alter their behaviors to respond effectively in changing contexts. In this lively and practical book, Goffee and Jones draw from extensive research to reveal how to hone and deploy one’s unique leadership assets while managing the inherent tensions at the heart of successful leadership: showing emotion and withholding it, getting close to followers while keeping distance, and maintaining individuality while “conforming enough.” Underscoring the social nature of leadership, the book also explores how leaders can remain attuned to the needs and expectations of followers.Why Should Anyone Be Led By You? will forever change how we view, develop, and practice the art of leadership, wherever we live and work.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9780415689526","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"High-Leverage Leadership","authors":["Denis Mongon","Christopher Chapman"],"pages":"192","publication_date":"June 2013","description":"Globalisation of world trade, international media, technological innovation and social change are creating opportunities and challenges that today’s pupils will inherit and build on.

Leaders and institutions of every kind--public and private, large and small--must compete in the marketplace of images and messages. This has been true since the advent of mass media, from broad circulation magazines and radio through the age of television and the internet. Yet there have been very few true geniuses at the art of mass persuasion in the last century. In public relations, Edward Bernays comes to mind. In advertising, most Hall-of-Famers--J. Walter Thomson, David Ogilvy, Bill Bernbach, Bruce Barton, Ray Rubicam, and others--point to one individual as the \"father\" of modern advertising: Albert D. Lasker. And yet Lasker--unlike Bernays, Thomson, Ogilvy, and the others--remains an enigma. Now, Jeffrey Cruikshank and Arthur Schultz, having uncovered a treasure trove of Lasker's papers, have written a fascinating and revealing biography of one of the 20th century's most powerful, intriguing, and instructive figures. It is no exaggeration to say that Lasker created modern advertising. He was the first influential proponent of \"reason why\" advertising, a consumer-centered approach that skillfully melded form and content and a precursor to the \"unique selling proposition\" approach that today dominates the industry. More than that, he was a prominent political figure, champion of civil rights, man of extreme wealth and hobnobber with kings and maharajahs, as well as with the likes of Albert Einstein and Eleanor Roosevelt. He was also a deeply troubled man, who suffered mental collapses throughout his adult life, though was able fight through and continue his amazing creative and productive activities into later life.This is the story of a man who shaped an industry, and in many ways, shaped a century.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","History"]},{"id":"9780137049424","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Shrimp: The Endless Quest for Pink Gold","authors":["Jack Rudloe","Anne Rudloe"],"pages":"272","publication_date":"December 2009","description":"The story of shrimp is as delicious as the creatures themselves.

When he won, this black man also became the only contestant to be asked to share his victory—with a white woman. The request (and Pinkett’s subsequent refusal) set off a firestorm of controversy that inevitably focused on the issue of race in the American workplace and in society. For generations, African-Americans have been told that to succeed, they need to work twice as hard as everyone else. But as millions of black Americans were reminded by Pinkett’s experience, sometimes hard work is not enough. Black Faces in White Places is about “the game”—that is, the competitive world in which we all live and work. The book offers 10 revolutionary strategies for playing, mastering, and changing the game for the current generation, while undertaking a wholesale redefinition of the rules for those who will follow. It is not only about shattering the old “glass ceiling,” but also about examining the four dimensions of the contemporary black experience: identity, society, meritocracy, and opportunity. Ultimately, it is about changing the very concept of success itself. Based on the authors’ considerable experiences in business, in the public eye, and in the minority, the book shows how African-American professionals can (and must) think and act both Entrepreneurially and “Intrapreneurially,” combine their collective strengths with the wisdom of others, and plant the seeds of a positive and lasting legacy.","tags":["Other"]},{"id":"9781119753322","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Leadership U","authors":["Gary Burnison"],"pages":"144","publication_date":"July 2020","description":"Accelerating Through the Crisis Curve\n\nLeadership is all about others—inspiring them to believe, then enabling that belief to become reality. That’s the essence of Leadership U: it starts with ‘U’ but it’s not about ‘U.’\n\nThose timeless words are timelier than ever today, as leaders look to accelerate through the crisis curve. As author Gary Burnison observes, “There will likely be more change in the next two years than we have seen in the last twenty.”\n\nNow, in Leadership U: Accelerating Through the Crisis Curve, Burnison lays out a framework—his “Six Degrees of Leadership”—to show leaders how to create change. \n\nAnticipate – foreseeing what lies ahead, amid ambiguity and uncertainty that are throttled up like never before\n\nNavigate – course-correcting in real time, to keep the organization on an even keel\n\nCommunication – constantly connecting with others; the leader is both the messenger and the message\n\nListen – breaking down the organizational hierarchy to gather insights at all levels—especially what the leader doesn’t want to hear\n\nLearn – applying learning agility, to “know what to do when you don’t know what to do”\n\nLead – empowering others in a bottom-up culture that is more nimble, agile, innovative, and entrepreneurial than ever before.\n\nOnly by embracing these truths can leaders master another ‘U’—the “crisis curve” that will completely disrupt the business landscape.  The world has changed—forever. The old days are fine to reminiscence about, but you can’t stay there.\n\nToday leadership means becoming comfortable with being uncomfortable. As Burnison says, when a door closes, leaders cannot afford to stand there, staring at it. It’s a “get up or give up” moment. For leaders, the only choice is to find and open another door. Leadership U defines and inspires the pathway through that door.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9780814434703","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Upside","authors":["Kenneth W.

Today's complex times require a new kind of leadership--one that encompasses a mind-set and capabilities that can't necessarily be taught by conventional methods. In this unique leadership book, Sharon Daloz Parks invites readers to step into the classroom of Harvard leadership virtuoso Ronald Heifetz and his colleagues to understand this dynamic type of leadership and experience a corresponding mode of learning called \"case in point.\" Unlike traditional teaching approaches that analyze the experiences of past leaders, case in point uses individuals' own experiences--and the classroom environment itself--as a crucible for learning. This bold approach enables emerging leaders to work actively through the complex demands of today's workplace and build their skills as they discover theory in practice. Through an engaging, you-are-there writing style, Parks outlines essential features of this approach that can be applied across a range of settings. In the process, Leadership Can Be Taught reveals how we can learn, practice, and teach the art of leadership in more skilled, effective, and inspired forms.

The Balkans has become synonymous with chaos and extremism. Balkanization, meaning conflict arising from the fragmentation of political power, is a condition feared across the globe. This new text assesses the key issues of Balkan politics, showing how the development of exclusive nationalism has prevented the region’s human and material resources from being harnessed in a constructive way.\n\nIt argues that the proximity of the Balkans to the great powers is the main reason for instability and decline. Britain, Russia, Austria-Hungary, France and finally the USA had conflicting ambitions and interests in the region. Russia had imperial designs before and after the 1917 Revolution. The Western powers sometimes tolerated these or encouraged undemocratic local forces to exercise control in order to block further Soviet expansion.\n\nLeading authority Tom Gallagher examines the origins of these Western prejudices towards the Balkans, tracing the damaging effects of policies based on Western lethargy and cynicism, and reassesses the negative image of the region, its citizens, their leadership skills and their potential to overcome crucial problems.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","History"]},{"id":"01520110057SI","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Online Follow-Up: Using Technology to Enhance Learnig","authors":["Wynn Whyman","Laura Santana","Leigh Allen"],"pages":"6","publication_date":"January 2005","description":"Participants in leadership development programs face a big challenge once they get back to work: preventing the energy created during the program from evaporating over time.

In turn, the politicisation of this conflict provides a terrain on which the Culture Wars and the politicisation of identity can flourish. Through exploring the interaction between the problems of socialisation and identity, this study offers a unique account of the origins and rise of the Culture Wars.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences"]},{"id":"9781932266825","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Ethereal Packet Sniffing","authors":["Syngress"],"pages":"550","publication_date":"February 2004","description":"This book provides system administrators with all of the information as well as software they need to run Ethereal Protocol Analyzer on their networks.

The book explores the stability of the ruling regime in light of the challenges that multiethnicity brings.\n\nPersians comprise less than half of the population of Iran and more than 40 percent of Iranians lack fluency in the Persian language. An overwhelming majority of non-Persian groups inhabit most of Iran’s border regions; as such the book explores Iran’s foreign policy toward neighboring states that share co-ethnic populations. Iran’s ethnic minorities inhabit the state’s poorest provinces and the country’s growing environmental and water supply challenges hit the ethnic minority provinces harder than the Persian center, adding an ominous ethnic character to what are often presented as purely environmental or economic challenges. The book further examines the potential impact of ethnic based unrest in Khuzestan on Iran’s oil production, Iran’s main oil producing region.\n\nDrawing on a rich assortment of primary data and interviews, this book offers unparalled insights into ethnic politics in Iran.

Low rank—signifying weakness—marks people for abuse and discrimination in much the same way that race, religion, gender, and sexual orientation have long done. In All Rise, Fuller examines the personal, professional, and political costs of rankism and provides compelling models and strategies for realizing a post-rankist world in which everyone's dignity is upheld.Fuller makes the case that rankism is the chief remaining obstacle to achieving liberty and justice for all, and shows how we can root it out. He doesn't propose that we do away with rank—without it organizations become dysfunctional—but rather argues for a “dignitarian” society in which rankism is no longer tolerated. He begins by demonstrating how rankism is rife in our social and civic institutions and then explores alternative dignitarian models for education, health care, politics, and religion.All Rise describes an emerging “politics of dignity” that bridges the conservative-liberal divide to put the “We” back in “We the people.” It argues that democracy is a work in progress and that its next natural step is the building of a dignitarian society.","tags":["Other","Politics & Global Issues"]},{"id":"9780814429327","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Art of Winning Commitment","authors":["Dick Richards"],"pages":"224","publication_date":"March 2004","description":"Leadership books most often cite interviews with high-profile business executives while offering do-and-don’t case studies of different corporate initiatives in action.

Like it or not, the realities uncovered in this book are just that...real! And if you plan to be a significant player in the workplace of the future, I suggest you take them seriously, because your success depends on it. As John says, ‘As goes the world, so goes the workplace.’” —Richard Irwin, President and CEO, IntegraCare Corporation\n\n“John captures a refreshing, winning formula in a practical, simple context to leverage weirdness into creativity and innovation, the core of sustainable competitive advantage and success. Rejoice in and celebrate our weirdos!” —James E. Hoffman, Jr., President, Catalyst Consultants, LLC, and the CEO Forum of Pittsburgh\n\n“To hear John Putzier tell it, there are so many ‘weirdos in the workplace’ that you’re almost weird if you’re...not. But if you’re a manager, don’t let how weird someone is distract you from what really matters—how well they’re performing. Here’s help for jumping to the right conclusions about people.” —Maureen Anderson, Host, “The Career Clinic®” radio program\n\n“This book gives a dose of medicine to cure the ‘paradigm bug’ that plagues most of us in the business world. The author takes complex situations and concepts and boils them down to their bare essence. I just wish I could have him by my side when they happen to me! I guess having this book is the next best thing.” —Mark A. Treat, Client Services Organization Development, Acxiom Corporation, CMTII Group\n\n“Putzier has nailed the American paradox: the tension between individuality and the need for organized group effort. His decision-making and problem-solving tools help to resolve this classic cultural conflict: the value of ‘weird’ thinking, diversity, and individuality pushing the bounds of what is normal, versus the utility of social norms in groups. His book is a primer for designing organizations, departments, or teams to maximize off-center behavior. This balance, already a rare one, will increase in importance as work becomes delocalized, cross-disciplinary, and global. This book provides basic knowledge for any company committed to innovation or excellence—or just competitive advantage.” —Margaret J. King, Ph.D., Director, The Center for Cultural Studies & Analysis, American Creativity Association\n\nSurviving and Thriving in the Age of the Individual\n\nOne employee always wears the same outfit to work, another talks to herself all day, another moonlights as a stripper, another has fierce body odor, and still another adorns his cubicle with hateful messages about his boss. As a manager, what should you do about such behavior? The best answers aren’t obvious! Your most innovative and productive people are often your strangest, and while weirdness can be rooted in brilliance, it can also be a real annoyance that serves no purpose.\n\nLike it or not, as modern culture embraces the individual, weirdos—anyone different from you!—become more commonplace. In Weirdos in the Workplace, top human resources consultant John Putzier explains how managers can harness the natural weirdness often found in high performers at every level, while curbing behavior that’s disruptive. Putzier presents 32 fascinating, real-world case studies to illustrate the legal, human resources, and business ramifications of unusual behavior in the workplace, and which solutions are most effective.\n\nThis book explains how to\n\nManage unconventional people by understanding why they behave as they do, and what to do about it\n\nMigrate toward a high-performing organization built around the individual, and foster an environment that attracts, motivates, and retains the best and brightest\n\nTap your own natural weirdness and find your niche by integrating your abilities, interests, and the market\n\nWeirdos in the Workplace is for every manager, human resources professional, or coworker who deals with unorthodox employees and their behaviors. This book also helps you maximize your performance and value by recognizing your own inner weirdo.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781430231479","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Beginning Oracle Application Express 4","authors":["Doug Gault","Karen Cannell","Patrick Cimolini"],"pages":"439","publication_date":"March 2011","description":"Beginning Oracle Application Express 4 introduces one of the most talked about development platforms to come out of Oracle Corporation in years.

From the 1880s to the 1960s, protagonists of the Greater India theme attempted to make a case for the importance of an expansionist Indian civilisation in civilizing Southeast Asia. The argument was extended to include Central Asia, Africa, North and South America, and other regions where Indian migrants were to be found. The advocates of this Indocentric and Hindu revivalist approach, with Hindu and Indian often taken to be synonymous, were involved in a quintessentially parochial project, despite its apparently international dimensions: to justify an Indian expansionist imagination that viewed India’s past as a colonizer and civilizer of other lands as a model for the restoration of that past greatness in the future. Zabarskaite shows that the crucial ideologues and elements used for the formation of the construct of Greater India can be traced to the svadeśī movement of the turn of the century, and that Greater India moved easily between the domains of the scholarly and the popular as it sought to establish itself as a form of nationalist self-assertion.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","History"]},{"id":"9781523088324","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Untapped Agility","authors":["Jesse Fewell"],"pages":"240","publication_date":"July 2020","description":"This balanced guide to agility gets past the hype and frustration to help frustrated leaders transform their agile transformations. Agile transformations are supposed to make organizations modern, competitive, and relevant. But in the well-intentioned effort to move into the future, change leaders find themselves frustrated by pushback, limited impact, poor practices, and unfair criticism. What's going on? Jesse Fewell's book cuts through the “quick-fix” hype of agile theory and explains a recurring transformational pattern that unpacks what holds organizations back. The boost is the initial gains from logical first steps; the barrier is the unavoidable roadblock that must come next; and the rebound is the way forward to further gains by leaning against the concept of the original boost. With these counterintuitive rebounds, Fewell identifies seven leadership moves that can be used to unblock stalled agile transformations. No, your transformation is not a failure. It turns out the buy-in, the talent, the alignment, and the growth you need to break through are already in front of you; it's all simply hidden under the surface—undiscovered, unutilized, and untapped.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781609940089","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"True North Groups","authors":["Bill George","Douglas M.

We need a small group of people with whom we can have in-depth discussions and share intimately about the most important things in our lives—our happiness and sadness, our hopes and fears, our beliefs and convictions. For the past thirty-five years, Bill George and Doug Baker have found the answer in what they call True North Groups.“At various times,” George and Baker write, “a True North Group will function as a nurturer, a grounding rod, a truth teller, and a mirror. At other times the group functions as a challenger or an inspirer. When people are wracked with self-doubts, it helps build their courage and ability to cope.”Drawing on recent research in psychology and sociology, George and Baker explain why True North Groups are so critical to helping us develop the self-awareness, compassion, emotional intelligence, and authenticity required to be inspired human beings and inspiring leaders. They cover every detail from choosing members, establishing norms, and dealing with conflicts to evaluating progress and deciding when it's time to restructure. True North Groups provides a wealth of practical resources, including suggested topics for the first twelve meetings, advice on facilitating groups, techniques to evaluate group satisfaction, and much more. For the millions of people who are searching for greater meaning and intimacy in their lives, this book will help them to grow as leaders and as people—and to stay on course to their True North.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781632650047","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Lead Inside the Box","authors":["Victor Prince"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"July 2015","description":"Every employee is different, but unfortunately many leaders use a one-size-fits-all approach to leading.

Capra, a bestselling author, physicist, and systems theorist, and Mattei, a distinguished legal scholar, explain how, by incorporating concepts from modern science, the law can become an integral part of bringing about a better world, rather than facilitating its destruction. This is the first book to trace the fascinating parallel history of law and science from antiquity to modern times, showing how the two disciplines have always influenced each other—until recently. In the past few decades, science has shifted from seeing the natural world as a kind of cosmic machine best understood by analyzing each cog and sprocket to a systems perspective that views the world as a vast network of fluid communities and studies their dynamic interactions. The concept of ecology exemplifies this approach. But law is stuck in the old mechanistic paradigm: the world is simply a collection of discrete parts, and ownership of these parts is an individual right, protected by the state. Capra and Mattei show that this has led to overconsumption, pollution, and a general disregard on the part of the powerful for the common good. Capra and Mattei outline the basic concepts and structures of a legal order consistent with the ecological principles that sustain life on this planet. This is a profound and visionary reconceptualization of the very foundations of the Western legal system, a kind of Copernican revolution in the law, with profound implications for the future of our planet.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences"]},{"id":"9781633691407","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"How to Choose a Leadership Pattern","authors":["Robert Tannenbaum","Warren H.

In this prescient and pragmatic book, he and his team sum up these concerns in what they call the ADAPT framework: Asymmetry of wealth; Disruption wrought by the unexpected and often problematic consequences of technology; Age disparities—stresses caused by very young or very old populations in developed and emerging countries; Populism as a symptom of the breakdown in global and national consensus; and loss of Trust in the institutions that underpin and stabilize society. These concerns are in turn precipitating four crises: a crisis of prosperity, a crisis of technology, a crisis of institutional legitimacy, and a crisis of leadership.Sheppard and his team analyze the complex roots of these crises—but they also offer solutions, albeit often seemingly counterintuitive ones. For example, in an era of globalization, we need to place a much greater emphasis on developing self-sustaining local economies. And as technology permeates our lives, we need computer scientists and engineers conversant with sociology and psychology and poets who can code. The authors argue persuasively that we have only a decade to make headway on these problems. But if we tackle them now, thoughtfully, imaginatively, creatively, and energetically, in ten years we could be looking at a dawn instead of darkness.","tags":["Other","Politics & Global Issues"]},{"id":"53863MIT61311","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Future of Work in Developing Economies","authors":["Pablo Egaña del Sol","Connor Joyce"],"pages":"5","publication_date":"January 2020","description":"Countries facing the greatest risk from automation are those that have labor economies in which many jobs involve manual or routine tasks that can be easily automated.

They were wrong—balance triumphed. A healthy society balances a public sector of respected governments, a private sector of responsible businesses, and a plural sector of robust communities. Communism collapsed under the weight of its overbearing public sector.Now the “liberal democracies” are threatened—socially, politically, even economically—by the unchecked excesses of the private sector.Radical renewal will have to begin in the plural sector, which alone has the inclination and the independence to challenge unacceptable practices and develop better ones. Too many governments have been co-opted by the private sector. And corporate social responsibility can't compensate for the corporate social irresponsibility we see around us “They” won't do it. We shall have to do it, each of us and all of us, not as passive “human resources,” but as resourceful human beings.Tom Paine wrote in 1776, “We have it in our power to begin the world over again.” He was right then.

Enough of the pendulum politics of left and right and paralysis in the political center. We require an unprecedented form of radical renewal. In this book Henry Mintzberg offers a new understanding of the root of our current crisis and a strategy for restoring the balance so vital to the survival of our progeny and our planet.With the collapse of the communist regimes of Eastern Europe, Western pundits declared that capitalism had triumphed. They were wrong—balance triumphed. A healthy society balances a public sector of respected governments, a private sector of responsible businesses, and a plural sector of robust communities. Communism collapsed under the weight of its overbearing public sector.Now the “liberal democracies” are threatened—socially, politically, even economically—by the unchecked excesses of the private sector.Radical renewal will have to begin in the plural sector, which alone has the inclination and the independence to challenge unacceptable practices and develop better ones. Too many governments have been co-opted by the private sector. And corporate social responsibility can't compensate for the corporate social irresponsibility we see around us “They” won't do it. We shall have to do it, each of us and all of us, not as passive “human resources,” but as resourceful human beings.Tom Paine wrote in 1776, “We have it in our power to begin the world over again.” He was right then.

However, beyond its role as a protective covering against coronavirus infection, the face mask is the bearer of powerful symbolic and political power and arouses intense emotions. Adopting an international perspective informed by social theory, The Face Mask in COVID Times: A Sociomaterial Analysis offers an intriguing and original investigation of the social, cultural and historical dimensions of face-masking as a practice in the age of COVID.\n\nRather than Beck’s ‘risk society’, we are now living in a ‘COVID society’, the long-term effects of which have yet to be experienced or imagined. Everything has changed. The COVID crisis has generated novel forms of sociality and new ways of living and moving through space and time. In this new world, the face mask has become a significant object, positioned as one of the key ways people can protect themselves and others from infection with the coronavirus. The face mask is rich with symbolic meaning as well as practical value. In the words of theorist Jane Bennett, the face mask has acquired a new ‘thing-power’ as it is coming together with human bodies in these times of uncertainty, illness and death.\n\nThe role of the face mask in COVID times has been the subject of debate and dissension, arousing strong feelings. The historical and cultural contexts in which face masks against COVID contagion are worn (or not worn) are important to consider. In some countries, such as Japan and other East Asian nations, face mask wearing has a long tradition. Full or partial facial coverings, such as veiling, is common practice in regions such as the Middle East. In many other countries, including most countries in the Global North, most people, beyond health care workers, have little or no experience of face masks. They have had to learn how to make sense of face masking as a protective practice and how to incorporate face masks into their everyday practices and routines.\n\nFace masking practices have become highly political. The USA has witnessed protests against face mask wearing that rest on ‘sovereign individualism’, a notion which is highly specific to the contemporary political climate in that country. Face masks have also been worn to make political statements: bearing anti-racist statements, for example, but also Trump campaign support. Meanwhile, celebrities and influencers have sought to advocate for face mask wearing as part of their branding, while art makers, museums, designers and novelty fashion manufacturers have identified the opportunity to profit from this sudden new market. Face masks have become a fashion item as well as a medical device: both a way of signifying the wearer’s individuality and beliefs and their ethical stance in relation to the need to protect their own and others’ health.\n\nThe Face Mask in COVID Times: A Sociomaterial Analysis provides a short and accessible analysis of the sociomaterial dimensions of the face mask in the age of COVID-19. The book presents seven short chapters and an epilogue. We bring together sociomaterial theoretical perspectives with compelling examples from public health advice and campaigns, anti-mask activism as well as popular culture (news reports, blog posts, videos, online shopping sites, art works) to illustrate our theoretical points, and use Images to support our analysis.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","Political Science"]},{"id":"9781119832355","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"The Joe Biden Way","authors":["Jeffrey A.

Journal articles, blogs and books try to home in on the essence of an effective leader. While there is common agreement that a executive's performance can make or break company, defining that essence of effective leadership remains the Holy Grail for those who find themselves at the top, for those who are responsible for carrying out the strategies and dictates of their managers, and for the shareholders who want to see commitment, action and positive financial return.\n\nBreaking the Leadership Mold is designed to help senior executives and managers respond to the challenges of today and shed the vestiges of days gone by. In so doing they will better lead and enable their staff, and create a work environment that is healthy, engaging, productive and sustainable. Based on the author's extensive research and 35 years' experience in working with local, national and international companies, Breaking the Leadership Mold offers 20 principles-such as Principle #10: Recognize How Executive Team Dynamics Promote Mediocrity and Principle #14: Get Other Executives On Board (or Out of the Way)—that when implemented will ensure that not only is there effective communication throughout the organization, from top to bottom and bottom to top, but also that employees and executives alike contribute to their full potential. The net result — the organization wins on every measure. The 20 principles are built on the pillars of case studies, experience and research.\n\nEffective leadership is an absolute in any business environment, but becomes even more critical in times when businesses face unprecedented challenges and need to be nimble and responsive to change. Breaking the Mold has proven strategies to empower, unite and galvanize managers and employees — and their organization - to enable them to prosper and adapt in a swift-changing environment.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781604913231","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Leadership in Action: In Focus - Leadership Styles - If It's Lagom, This Must be Sweden","authors":["Kristina Williams","Kay Devine"],"pages":"2","publication_date":"August 2005","description":"Paradoxically, despite their unemotional countenance, Swedish executives are likely to exhibit a people-oriented leadership style.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781604914672","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Leadership in Action: Mediocrity at the Top: Pulling Away From the Pack","authors":["Harold Scharlatt","Sloan R.

Citing the convergence of modern science and the essence of the world's wisdom traditions, Michael Nagler argues for a new story: the universe is conscious and purposeful, humans are spiritual beings, and cooperation and collaboration are our natural way of interacting. This “new story” has had other champions, but Nagler is the first to realize that a piece is missing. For the new story to take hold, we have to embrace nonviolence, not only as a social change tactic but as a way of life. Nonviolence is the only power strong enough to “move the heart” toward this deep and revolutionary change in worldview. Nagler refers to this as the “third harmony,” which is the harmony within and among us to resolve the crisis of the human image. Calling on us to realize the urgency of nonviolence for resolving our personal and collective problems, Nagler focuses on how to shift to our story on a personal, everyday level and then integrate it into the very foundations of our understanding of humanity and community, for our sake, for the sake of future generations, and the sake of nonviolence itself.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences"]},{"id":"9781626562202","language":"en","level":null,"title":"In Their Own Hands","authors":["Jeffrey Ashe","Kyla Jagger Neilan","Frances Moore Lappé"],"publication_date":"September 2014","description":"Two and a half billion people worldwide, most of them desperately poor villagers, need a better way to save and to borrow. Even the most innovative banking institutions can’t reach them; savings groups can. In savings groups, members save what they can in a communal pot and loan their growing fund to each other for their short-term needs. Jeffrey Ashe and Kyla Neilan illustrate how these savings groups form and function and how little “outside” support is actually required for their success. Drawing on decades of Ashe’s personal experience, this book describes how he developed Saving for Change, which leveraged the wisdom and strength of group members to train and establish new groups. This model has impacted the lives of 680,000 people across five countries. Savings groups are a “catalytic innovation” that bypasses subsidies, dependency, and high costs while effectively reducing chronic hunger, building assets, and empowering the community. Today, saving groups have 9 million members around the globe—with minimal support, membership could grow to ten times this number.","tags":["Other","Politics & Global Issues"]},{"id":"9781604910728","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Change Now!

Toward this end, Citizen-Centered Cities provides a body of experience about public involvement that would take years for municipal administrators to accumulate on the job. The opening chapter summarizes nine challenges for public involvement, together with over sixty aspirational recommendations. Subsequent chapters provide detailed case studies illustrating these challenges for a range of projects—a new bridge, a light rail line, a highway interchange, neighborhood street modifications, urban streetscaping, bicycle routes, movement of freight, and a transportation master plan.

Yet, current management education is largely based on traditional capitalism where the focus tends toward profits and competitiveness rather than toward a balance among profitability, responsibility, social accountability and sustainability. Consequently, management education in general, and MBA education in particular, need to adopt a paradigm shift in order to be more responsible and sustainable.

With this in mind, the contributors to this edited collection draw attention to children as thinkers, actors and transformers of the future of the tourism and hospitality industry. Through a mix of conceptual and empirical chapters, the book collectively supports an overarching theme: the empowerment of children as present and future consumers should be a core component of any sustainable tourism initiative.

It continues its struggle today, influencing and shaping Lebanese and Syrian society and politics. Yet, the party remains largely unknown and misunderstood, a condition that stems from the lack of any comprehensive study of it. This book fills this gap.\n\nSyrian nationalism and nationalist movements, generally speaking, have been largely neglected and ignored by historians, scholars, and observers of the Middle East. So, too, has the SSNP. The lack of detailed and nuanced analyses has left significant gaps in the party’s rich history unaddressed and enabled the perpetuation of inaccuracies and misperceptions regarding its past. Given this and the party’s ongoing relevance in Lebanon and Syria, a thorough examination of the early history of the SSNP, the political organization and movement that embodied Syrian nationalism’s most explicit, most cogent expression is even more necessary.\n\nBased on an extensive and thorough examination of Arabic, French, and English primary sources, the monograph is the first comprehensive, systematic history of the SSNP to date, detailing its struggle to fulfill its nationalist vision and establish a secular, independent state in Greater Syria through a thorough analysis of its formation, evolution, and political activities in Lebanon and Syria.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","History"]},{"id":"9780749453978","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Delivering E-Learning","authors":["Kenneth Fee"],"pages":"192","publication_date":"April 2009","description":"Delivering E-Learning presents a complete strategy for training and development.

On the surface, this paradox seems to be reducible to a straightforward discrepancy between idealism and reality in humanitarian affairs, but Imagining Human Rights complicates the picture by offering interdisciplinary perspectives on the imaginary status of human rights. By that the contributors mean not merely subject to imagination, open to interpretation or far too abstract, but also formative of a social imaginary with emphatic identifications and shared values. From a variety of disciplinary perspectives, they explore critical ways of engaging in rigorous interdisciplinary conversations about the origin and language of human rights, personal dignity, redistributive justice, and international solidarity. Together, they show how and why a careful examination of the intersection between disciplinary investigations is essential for imagining human rights at large. Examples range from the legitimacy of land ownership rights and the inadequacy of human faculty to make sense of mass violence in visual representation to the stewardship of human rights promoters and the genealogy of human rights.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences"]},{"id":"9781606492055","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"The Emerging Markets of the Middle East","authors":["Tim J.

The authors share insights from their study of successes and failures at more than four hundred organizations that have used social technologies to fosterand capitalize oncustomers’ and employees’ collective efforts.But the new social technology landscape isn’t about the technology. It’s about building communities, fostering new ways of collaborating, and guiding these efforts to achieve a purpose. To that end, the authors identify the core disciplines managers must master to translate community collaboration into otherwise impossible results: Vision: defining a compelling vision of progress toward a highly collaborative organization. Strategy: taking community collaboration from risky and random success to measurable business value. Purpose: rallying people around a clear purpose, not just providing technology.  Launch: creating a collaborative environment and gaining adoption. Guide: participating in and influencing communities without stifling collaboration. Adapt: responding creatively to change in order to better support community collaboration.The Social Organization highlights the benefits and challenges of using social technology to tap the power of people, revealing what managers must do to make collaboration a source of enduring competitive advantage.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781501507212","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The China Paradox","authors":["Paul G.

This flourishing of China’s hybrid developmental model is placed firmly in the historical context, shedding light on the legacies that thwarted earlier attempts at change and which today still threaten to render the progress unsustainable.

During his short working life, Blumlein produced patent after patent breaking entirely new ground in electronic and audio engineering.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Alan Blumlein was deeply engaged in the very secret work of radar development and contributed enormously to the system eventually to become 'H2S'- blind bombing radar. Tragically, during an experimental H2S flight in June 1942, the Halifax bomber in which Blumlein and several colleagues were flying, crashed and all aboard were killed. He was just days short of his 39th birthday.\n\nFor many years there have been rumours about a biography of Alan Blumlein, yet none has been forthcoming.

How to create new sources of competitive advantage to sustain long-term growth, and 2. How to engage leaders at every level of the organization so that they are more proactive and forward-looking in their area of responsibility. The Art of Strategic Leadership uses a unique approach to examine what it means to be a strategic leader. Instead of focusing on the skills, behaviors, and tools found in typical books on strategic leadership, the authors shed light on the attributes and qualities necessary to lead strategic change and help transform a business. Strategic leadership is what modern leadership is all about. Organizations expect leaders to anticipate and be proactive more than ever before. In this book, the authors draw on their vast experience working directly with leaders at all levels and use an intriguing narrative to explain this inside-out approach to understanding strategic leadership. The narrative follows the journey of how one manager discovered these critically important qualities. You will experience first-hand how these values and attributes manifest in the lives of realistic leaders; how they orchestrate long-term strategic change needed for the organization to compete and survive and actively shape the future while delivering short-term results.\n\nThe Art of Strategic Leadership provides the content that will help you informally assess and reflect on your own strategic leadership qualities—those that are strengths and those that indicate areas you need to develop. It will guide you as you incorporate these values and qualities into your own leadership style and become a more effective catalyst for change. This book will help you in the following ways:\n\nDevelop a more proactive, forward-thinking approach to leadership\nApproach strategy from both short- and long-term perspectives\nAdopt the core values and principles of a strategic leader\nModel the qualities exhibited by powerful leaders\n\nStrategic leaders serve as powerful examples to others in the organization. Their qualities and traits spread rapidly to those around them, empowering people at every level to take a more active role in meeting the demands of the future. The Art of Strategic Leadership will help you deepen and broaden your understanding of the core qualities of strategic leadership, leaving you better equipped to lead yourself and your team to a better place and create greater value for customers, owners, and employees.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781040323120","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Contemporary Selling, 7th Edition","authors":["Mark W.

By measuring success in multiple dimensions using multivariate methods you will be able to determine what works and what doesn't. The key is to measure and promote progress in terms of organizational vision, mission, and overarching goals.\n\nBusiness leaders too often succumb to the working assumption that they only have to show shareholders and boards of trustees that they are turning a profit—the higher the profit, the more successful their stewardship of the company. Wrong! To truly thrive and endure, all organizations—corporate, government, small, large, nonprofit, or startup—need to define and pursue the underlying purpose for their existence.\n\nTo measure success, leaders today are missing a key meta-analytic in their toolbox. In this book, metrics consultant Martin Klubeck provides it to them. Success Metrics steps you through the process of identifying and combining the right measures to gauge, narrate, and guide your organization's progress toward true success. All organizations have a common goal to be successful. All leaders want to make data-informed decisions and use measures to improve processes, communicate progress, and gain support. The problem is that proxy or partial measures don't measure overall success and can be misleading. They measure performance parameters, progress on a specific task, customer feedback, and other piecemeal indices—which taken separately fail to describe an organization's progress toward overall success.\n\nThe author's integrated measures of success can be used to communicate organizational progress to stakeholders, shareholders, boards of trustees, corporate leaders, the workforce, and the customer base and thereby galvanize broad commitment to organizational success. Klubeck shows how his principles and methods of measuring overall success can be applied at all levels: individual, team, group, department, division, and organization.\n\nWhat You Will Learn:\n\nUnderstand why you should measure success instead of performance\n\nUnderstand what to measure and what not to measure\n\nIntegrate the measures of success to tell a complete story\n\nShare measures of success with different audiences\n\nWho This Book Is For\n\nOrganizational leaders at all levels from the executive suite to middle management, analysts and consultants who are tasked with designing metrics programs for organizations, individuals interested in adapting the author's framework to measure overall personal success in multiple dimensions","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781394224975","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Creating eCourses For Dummies","authors":["Amanda Rosenzweig"],"pages":"304","publication_date":"April 2024","description":"Design and build online courses that you will deploy with joy\n\nNeed to create a course for your learners and don't know where to begin?

As organizations face more complex interdependent tasks, leadership must become more personal in order to insure open trusting communication that will make more collaborative problem solving and innovation possible. Without open and trusting communications throughout organizations, they will continue to face the productivity and quality problems that result from reward systems that emphasize individual competition and “climbing the corporate ladder”. Authors Edgar Schein and Peter Schein recognize this reality and call for a reimagined form of leadership that coincides with emerging trends of relationship building, complex group work, diverse workforces, and cultures in which everyone feels psychologically safe. Humble Leadership calls for “here and now” humility based on a deeper understanding of the constantly evolving complexities of interpersonal, group and intergroup relationships that require shifting our focus towards the process of group dynamics and collaboration. Humble Leadership at all levels and in all working groups will be the key to achieving the creativity, adaptiveness, and agility that organizations will need to survive and grow.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9780071778367","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"ASVAB DeMYSTiFieD","authors":["Cynthia Johnson"],"pages":"352","publication_date":"October 2012","description":"A straightforward, step-by-step approach for fast and fun mastery of ASVAB\n\nASVAB DeMYSTiFieD takes the mystery out of studying for the ASVAB by walking you step-by-step through the fundamentals of the subject.

Anything that can be distributed will be distributed: workforces, organizations, supply webs, and more. The tired practices of centralized organizations will become brittle in a future where authority is radically decentralized. Rigid hierarchies will give way to liquid structures. Most leaders—and most organizations—aren't ready for this future. Are you?It's too late to catch up, but it's a great time to leapfrog. Noted futurist Bob Johansen goes beyond skills and competencies to propose five new leadership literacies—combinations of disciplines, practices, and worldviews—that will be needed to thrive in a VUCA world of increasing volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity. This book shows how to (1) forecast likely futures so you can “look back” and make sure you're prepared now for the changes to come, (2) use low-risk gaming spaces to work through your concerns about the future and hone your leadership skills, (3) lead shape-shifting organizations where you can't just tell people what to do, (4) be a dynamic presence even when you're not there in person, and (5) keep your personal energy high and transmit that energy throughout your organization. This visionary book provides a vivid description of the ideal talent profile for future leaders. It is written for current, rising star, and aspiring leaders; talent scouts searching for leaders; and executive coaches seeking a fresh view of how leaders will need to prepare.

For the past few decades, technology has been touted as the cure for all of healthcare’s ills.\n\nBut medicine stubbornly resisted computerization – until now. Over the past five years, thanks largely to billions of dollars in federal incentives, healthcare has finally gone digital.\n\nYet once clinicians started using computers to actually deliver care, it dawned on them that something was deeply wrong. Why were doctors no longer making eye contact with their patients? How could one of America’s leading hospitals give a teenager a 39-fold overdose of a common antibiotic, despite a state-of-the-art computerized prescribing system? How could a recruiting ad for physicians tout the absence of an electronic medical record as a major selling point?\n\nLogically enough, we’ve pinned the problems on clunky software, flawed implementations, absurd regulations, and bad karma. It was all of those things, but it was also something far more complicated. And far more interesting . . .\n\nWritten with a rare combination of compelling stories and hard-hitting analysis by one of the nation’s most thoughtful physicians, The Digital Doctor examines healthcare at the dawn of its computer age. It tackles the hard questions, from how technology is changing care at the bedside to whether government intervention has been useful or destructive. And it does so with clarity, insight, humor, and compassion. Ultimately, it is a hopeful story.\n\n\"We need to recognize that computers in healthcare don’t simply replace my doctor’s scrawl with Helvetica 12,\" writes the author Dr. Robert Wachter. \"Instead, they transform the work, the people who do it, and their relationships with each other and with patients. . . . Sure, we should have thought of this sooner. But it’s not too late to get it right.\"\n\nThis riveting book offers the prescription for getting it right, making it essential reading for everyone – patient and provider alike – who cares about our healthcare system.","tags":["Other"]},{"id":"9781607281665","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"ISD From The Ground Up, 4th Edition","authors":["Chuck Hodell"],"pages":"304","publication_date":"December 2015","description":"Don’t leave course design to trial and error.

They're unreliable and inefficient.Oracle DBAs and developers are all too familiar with the outlay of time and resources, blown budgets, missed deadlines, and marginally effective performance fiddling that is commonplace with traditional methods of Oracle performance tuning. In this crucial book, Cary Millsap, former VP of Oracle's System Performance Group, clearly and concisely explains how to use Oracle's response time statistics to diagnose and repair performance problems. Cary also shows how \"queueing theory\" can be applied to response time statistics to predict the impact of upgrades and other system changes.Optimizing Oracle Performance eliminates the time-consuming, trial-and-error guesswork inherent in most conventional approaches to tuning. You can determine exactly where a system's performance problem is, and with equal importance, where it is not, in just a few minutes--even if the problem is several years old.Optimizing Oracle Performance cuts a path through the complexity of current tuning methods, and streamlines an approach that focuses on optimization techniques that any DBA can use quickly and successfully to make noticeable--even dramatic--improvements.For example, the one thing database users care most about is response time. Naturally, DBAs focus much of their time and effort towards improving response time. But it is entirely too easy to spend hundreds of hours to improve important system metrics such as hit ratios, average latencies, and wait times, only to find users are unable to perceive the difference. And an expensive hardware upgrade may not help either.It doesn't have to be that way. Technological advances have added impact, efficiency, measurability, predictive capacity, reliability, speed, and practicality to the science of Oracle performance optimization. Optimizing Oracle Performance shows you how to slash the frustration and expense associated with unraveling the true root cause of any type of performance problem, and reliably predict future performance.The price of this essential book will be paid back in hours saved the first time its methods are used.","tags":["Data","Data Engineering","Oracle Database Solutions"]},{"id":"9781484223284","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Oracle Database Upgrade and Migration Methods: Including Oracle 12c Release 2","authors":["Y V Ravikumar","K M Krishnakumar","Nassyam Basha"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"March 2017","description":"Learn all of the available upgrade and migration methods in detail to move to Oracle Database version 12c.

Conversely, how do senior leaders describe the kind of leader that undercuts the organization’s capacity and capability to create its future? This book, based on groundbreaking research, shows how senior leaders describe and develop leadership that works, that does not, that scales, and that limits scale.\n\nIs your leadership built for scale as you advance in today’s volatile, uncertain, dynamic, and disruptive business environment? This context puts a premium on a very particular kind of leadership—High-Creative leadership capable of rapidly growing the organization while simultaneously transforming it into more agile, innovative, adaptive and engaging workplace. The research presented in this book suggests that senior leaders can describe the High-Creative leadership with surprising clarity. They also describe with equal precision the High-Reactive leadership that cancels itself out and seriously limits scale. Which type of leader are you?\n\nYou scale your leadership by increasing the multiple on your leadership in three ways. First, by developing the strengths that differentiate the most effective leaders from the strengths deployed by the most Reactive and ineffective leaders. And second, by increasing your leadership ratio—the ratio of most the effective strengths to the most damaging liabilities. Third, by developing High-Creative leaders all around you.\n\nScaling Leadership provides a proven framework for magnifying agile and scalable leadership in your organization. Scalable leadership drives forward-momentum by multiplying high-achieving leaders at scale so that growth, productivity and innovation increase exponentially. Creative leaders multiply their strengths beyond technical competence by leading in deep relationship, with radical humanity, passion and integrity.\n\nDrawing upon decades of solid research and experience enhancing individual capability and collective leadership effectiveness with Fortune 500 companies and government agencies, the authors provide an innovative and efficient framework to help you:\n\nTake stock of your own personal balance of leadership strengths and weaknesses\nScale your leadership in deep relationship and high integrity\nProliferate high-achievers throughout your organization’s leadership system\nIdentify ineffective leadership and course-correct quickly\nTransform your organization by transforming leadership\n\nScaling Leadership is an invaluable tool for executives, managers, and leaders in business, academia, nonprofit organizations, and more.

Never have there been so many opportunities to inspire and influence in everyday situations -- elevator chats, corridor conversations, networking gatherings, meetings, and ceremonial events. Indeed, today the most iconic leadership moments are spontaneous, spur-of-the-moment events that reveal the inner workings of the leader's mind. When these impromptu opportunities arise, leaders must be able to listen, think, and respond within seconds. They don't read a script from a page, they convey the narrative that is already in their mind. They can tailor a message—in a meeting, in the corridor, or in a tweet—to influence and inspire any audience. Those who shine in that moment are remembered for their leadership. Those who stumble are remembered for their gaffes, mixed messages, or insensitivity. Nobody remembers the leaders who retreat to their office, formulate a strategic plan, and distribute a memo the following week.\n\nGuided by her entrepreneurial success as founder of The Humphrey Group and her firm's work with tens of thousands of leaders over the past 30 years, Judith Humphrey makes clear the importance of preparing to be spontaneous -- as counterintuitive as that may sound! Drawing upon the best impromptu moments from the Greeks to the present, the book looks at every aspect of impromptu speaking. You will learn how to:\n\nThink like an impromptu leader\nQuickly read an audience of one or a thousand\nCollect your thoughts and craft a persuasive message\n'Script' yourself within seconds for any occasion\nAvoid 'um's' and 'ah's' and use the right words at the right time\nDiscover improv techniques that will enable you to shine\nDeliver your message with clarity, confidence, and conviction.\n\nThe ability to speak on the spot is often seen as an innate gift, a talent of 'natural-born' leaders. The truth is, it's a skill that can be learned—a skill that is quickly becoming a must-have for anyone in a leadership position. Impromptu provides clear, actionable guidance to help you reach your full leadership potential. It will enable you to influence and inspire followers on the many 'small stages' that define our daily lives.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781789956375","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Mastering Palo Alto Networks","authors":["Tom Piens aka 'reaper'"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"September 2020","description":"Mastering Palo Alto Networks provides you with the skills needed to effectively secure modern network infrastructures.

Are participative management, self-directed work teams, and other popular empowerment programs just part of a futile effort to change \"human nature\"? Not at all, say David L. Bradford and Allan R. Cohen in this practical follow-up to their international bestsellers Managing for Excellence and Influence Without Authority. They show conclusively that to believe this grossly underestimates human capabilities and sacrifices any chance for success in today's fiercely competitive global marketplace.\n\nDrawing upon close observation of successful leaders and followers, Bradford and Cohen reconceptualize shared leadership to show how it requires tough and decisive behavior from managers and those who report to them. The authors provide a blueprint for making it work personally and in your organization, whatever your position or formal power.\n\nExercising their critically acclaimed talent for translating complex concepts into actionable advice and guidance, they show how to create a dynamic, supercharged organizational culture of shared responsibility. Using many real-life examples and vignettes, the authors reveal the mind-traps that keep organizations locked into outmoded concepts of leadership. A pathbreaking contribution to the new leadership from two pioneers in the field, Power Up arms managers with the concepts and tools to release the potential of employees for greater heights of productivity and performance.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9780124095052","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Cybercrime Investigation Case Studies","authors":["Brett Shavers"],"pages":"48","publication_date":"December 2012","description":"Cybercrime Investigation Case Studies is a \"first look\" excerpt from Brett Shavers' new Syngress book, Placing the Suspect Behind the Keyboard.

It lays a foundation for advanced performance tuning of the Oracle database. Based on Oracle8i release 8.1, the book describes many of the secrets of Oracle's internal services: data structures, algorithms, and undocumented Oracle system statistics. Main topics include:\n\nWaits - how Oracle processes communicate via semaphores, and how to use the Oracle wait statistics to identify the source of performance problems.\n\nLatches - how they keep multiple processes from inspecting protected data structures at the same time, and how to examine and control latch behavior and statistics.\n\nLocks - how they work with latches to protect data structures (locks allow multiple sessions to share resources in some cases), and how locks affect performance. There is also a detailed discussion of instance locks, which are used in parallel server environments.\n\nMemory - how Oracle uses memory (e.g., the various elements of the System Global Area), and how Oracle dynamically allocates and manages memory.\n\nOracle8i Internal Services is aimed especially at administrators and developers who need detailed internal information to do advanced performance tuning. The book will expand your repertoire of tuning solutions and troubleshooting techniques by explaining how you can use Oracle's hidden parameters and undocumented system statistics to best advantage.

American monopolies have also seized massive political power and use it to maintain their obscene profits and CEO salaries while crushing small competitors. But Thom Hartmann, America's #1 progressive radio host, shows we've broken the control of behemoths like these before, and we can do it again. Hartmann takes us from the birth of America as a revolt against monopoly (remember the Boston Tea Party?), to the largely successful efforts of both Presidents Theodore and Franklin Roosevelt and other like-minded leaders to restrain corporations' monopolistic urges, to the massive changes in the rules of business starting during the “Reagan Revolution” that have brought us to the cancer stage of capitalism. He shows the damage monopolies have done to so many industries: agriculture, healthcare, the media, and more. Individuals have taken a hit as well: the average American family pays a $5,000 a year “monopoly tax” in the form of higher prices for everything from pharmaceuticals to airfare to household goods and food. But Hartmann also describes commonsense, historically rooted measures we can take—such as revitalizing antitrust regulation, taxing great wealth, and getting money out of politics—to pry control of our country from the tentacles of the monopolists.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","History"]},{"id":"9780132488006","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"OpenCL Programming Guide","authors":["Aaftab Munshi","Benedict R.

But today's vastly complex, globalized, and fast-evolving world requires a different kind of leadership. This game-changing book details a new approach—entrepreneurial leadership—developed at Babson College, the number-one school for entrepreneurship in the world. Entrepreneurial leadership is inspired by, but is separate from, entrepreneurship. It can be applied in any organizational situation, not just start-ups. Based on two years of extensive research, it embraces three principles that add up to a fundamentally new worldview of business and a new logic of decision making. First, rapid change and increasing uncertainty require leaders to be “cognitively ambidextrous,” able to shift between traditional “prediction logic” (choosing actions based on analysis) and “creation logic” (taking action despite considerable unknowns). Guiding this different way of thinking and acting is a new view of business, where simultaneous creation of social, environmental, and economic value is the order of the day. Finally, entrepreneurial leaders leverage their understanding of themselves and their social context to guide effective action. Each chapter offers concrete examples of how educators across all disciplines are integrating these ideas into their courses—and even their entire curricula. The New Entrepreneurial Leader lays out a comprehensive new paradigm for reinventing management education in order to mold leaders who will shape social and economic opportunity.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781607284901","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Facilitation Basics, 2nd Edition","authors":["Donald V.

What’s below the waterline? What’s deep inside the best leaders that makes them different?Mark Miller contends it is their leadership character. In his latest enlightening and entertaining business fable, he describes the five unique character traits exhibited by exceptional leaders and how to cultivate them.The Heart of Leadership begins with young and ambitious Blake Brown being passed over for a desperately wanted promotion, despite an outstanding individual performance. Confused and frustrated, he turns to his former mentor, Debbie Brewster. Rather than attempting to solve Blake’s problem for him, she sends him on a quest to meet with five of his late father’s colleagues, each of whom holds a piece of the puzzle he’s trying to solve.As Blake puts the pieces together, he discovers that in the final analysis, a lack of skills isn’t what holds most leaders back; skills are too easy to learn. Without demonstrated leadership character, however, a skill set will never be enough. Most often, when leaders fail to reach their full potential, it is an issue of the heart. This is Blake’s ultimate revelation.This book shows us that leadership needn’t be the purview of the few—it is within reach for millions around the world.

Their transformational leadership system is both sophisticated enough to capture the realities of life in today's organizations and simple enough to be immediately useful to managers in any part of the world. This book will be read, re-read, and sent to bosses everywhere.\"--Rosabeth Moss Kanter, author of Rosabeth Moss Kanter on the Frontiers of Management\n\n\"In Power Up, Bradford and Cohen not only convincingly argue the benefits of leading by building a shared responsibility team, they also describe in detail how to do it.

Post-heroic leaders place responsibility where the knowledge is: at every level. Siemens is committed to this new way of working.\"--Dr. Heinrich von Pierer President and CEO, Siemens\n\nCountless articles and books have called for an end to \"heroic,\" command-and-control management. In principle, at least, business has heeded that call. Acknowledging the need for employee leadership and shared responsibility, companies worldwide have invested heavily in every variety of employee-empowerment program. Yet, such reform efforts seldom have any lasting effect, and managers and subordinates quickly slip back into old follow-the-leader patterns of thinking and behaving.\n\nDoes this mean that the skeptics were right all along? Are participative management, self-directed work teams, and other popular empowerment programs just part of a futile effort to change \"human nature\"? Not at all, say David L. Bradford and Allan R. Cohen in this practical follow-up to their international bestsellers Managing for Excellence and Influence Without Authority. They show conclusively that to believe this grossly underestimates human capabilities and sacrifices any chance for success in today's fiercely competitive global marketplace.\n\nDrawing upon close observation of successful leaders and followers, Bradford and Cohen reconceptualize shared leadership to show how it requires tough and decisive behavior from managers and those who report to them. The authors provide a blueprint for making it work personally and in your organization, whatever your position or formal power.\n\nExercising their critically acclaimed talent for translating complex concepts into actionable advice and guidance, they show how to create a dynamic, supercharged organizational culture of shared responsibility. Using many real-life examples and vignettes, the authors reveal the mind-traps that keep organizations locked into outmoded concepts of leadership. A pathbreaking contribution to the new leadership from two pioneers in the field, Power Up arms managers with the concepts and tools to release the potential of employees for greater heights of productivity and performance.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781118235423","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Smart Leaders, Smarter Teams: How You and Your Team Get Unstuck to Get Results","authors":["Roger M.

It lays a foundation for advanced performance tuning of the Oracle database. Based on Oracle8i release 8.1, the book describes many of the secrets of Oracle's internal services: data structures, algorithms, and undocumented Oracle system statistics. Main topics include:\n\nWaits - how Oracle processes communicate via semaphores, and how to use the Oracle wait statistics to identify the source of performance problems.\n\nLatches - how they keep multiple processes from inspecting protected data structures at the same time, and how to examine and control latch behavior and statistics.\n\nLocks - how they work with latches to protect data structures (locks allow multiple sessions to share resources in some cases), and how locks affect performance. There is also a detailed discussion of instance locks, which are used in parallel server environments.\n\nMemory - how Oracle uses memory (e.g., the various elements of the System Global Area), and how Oracle dynamically allocates and manages memory.\n\nOracle8i Internal Services is aimed especially at administrators and developers who need detailed internal information to do advanced performance tuning. The book will expand your repertoire of tuning solutions and troubleshooting techniques by explaining how you can use Oracle's hidden parameters and undocumented system statistics to best advantage. NOTE: The author has collected the scripts he has developed for tuning and analysis into a toolkit (known as APT, for Advanced Performance Tuning).

From the bestselling authors who taught the world how to have Crucial Conversations comes Influencer, a thought-provoking book that combines the remarkable insights of behavioral scientists and business leaders with the astonishing stories of high-powered influencers from all walks of life. You'll be taught each and every step of the influence process-including robust strategies for making change inevitable in your personal life, your business, and your world.

They can do this by offering vicarious experiences, restructured environments, peer pressure, and frequent tests-all geared so that people embrace the change as authentic to them, not imposed by an outsider.

Yet some CEOs deliver their greatest successes when times get toughestwhen customers’ preferences are shifting away from a company’s products, when new regulations are shrinking profit margins, when political unrest is destroying supply lines.In Better Under Pressure, Justin Menkes reveals the common traits that make these leaders successful. Drawing on in-depth interviews with sixty CEOs from an array of industries and performance data from two hundred other leaders, Menkes shows that great executives strive relentlessly to maximize their own potentialas well as stoke their people’s innate thirst for their own triumphs. To do so, they draw on a set of three essential and rare attributes: Realistic optimism: They recognize the risks threatening their organization’s survivaland their own failingswhile remaining confident in their ability to have an impact. Subservience to purpose: They dedicate themselves to pursuing a noble cause and win their team’s commitment to that cause. Finding order in chaos: They find clarity amid the many variables affecting their business by culling data and forming the conclusions that matter most to the company.The good news: these three capabilities can be learned. Drawing on a broad range of examples from real companiesincluding Avon, Yum Brands, Southwest, Procter & Gamble, and Ryerson Steel, to name just a fewMenkes demonstrates how each psychological attribute manifests itself in real life and enables top performance under extreme duress. He also shows you how to develop and deploy those attributesso you can transform yourself into a leader who only shines brighter as the pressure intensifies.Deeply personal, brimming with compelling stories from real-life CEOs, and packed with powerful insights, tools, and practices, this book is a potent resource for aspiring, emerging, and seasoned business leaders alike.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781000646283","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Complexity and Leadership","authors":["Kiran Chauhan","Emma Crewe","Chris Mowles"],"pages":"266","publication_date":"September 2022","description":"This book challenges the orthodox discourse on leadership – often expressed in heroic and individualistic terms – and presents leadership as a practice within which communication, research, imagination and ethical judgements are continuously improvised.

It organizes research in a unique conceptual framework addressing two broad themes: the Essence of Humor and the Functions of Humor. Furthermore, scholars of humor have recognized that humor is not only a universal human experience, it is also inherently social, shared among people and woven into the fabric of nearly every type of interpersonal relationship.\n\nScholars across all academic disciplines have addressed questions about the essence and functions of humor at different levels of analysis relating to how narrowly or broadly they conceptualize the social context of humor. Accordingly, the editors have organized each broad thematic section into three subsections defined by level of analysis. The book first addresses questions about individual psychological processes, then discusses text properties, and finally moves to questions involving broader conceptualizations of the social context addressing humor and social relations, as well as humor and culture.\n\nBy providing a comprehensive review of foundational work as well as new research and theoretical advancements across academic disciplines, the De Gruyter Handbook of Humor Studies will serve as the foremost authoritative research handbook for experienced humor scholars as well as an essential starting point for newcomers to the field, such as graduate students seeking to conduct their own research on humor.

American monopolies have also seized massive political power and use it to maintain their obscene profits and CEO salaries while crushing small competitors. But Thom Hartmann, America's #1 progressive radio host, shows we've broken the control of behemoths like these before, and we can do it again. Hartmann takes us from the birth of America as a revolt against monopoly (remember the Boston Tea Party?), to the largely successful efforts of both Presidents Theodore and Franklin Roosevelt and other like-minded leaders to restrain corporations' monopolistic urges, to the massive changes in the rules of business starting during the “Reagan Revolution” that have brought us to the cancer stage of capitalism. He shows the damage monopolies have done to so many industries: agriculture, healthcare, the media, and more. Individuals have taken a hit as well: the average American family pays a $5,000 a year “monopoly tax” in the form of higher prices for everything from pharmaceuticals to airfare to household goods and food. But Hartmann also describes commonsense, historically rooted measures we can take—such as revitalizing antitrust regulation, taxing great wealth, and getting money out of politics—to pry control of our country from the tentacles of the monopolists.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","History"]},{"id":"9781118999424","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Becoming the Best","authors":["Harry M.

It's the language used to query the database, to create new tables in the database, to update and delete database fields, and to set privileges in the database. Oracle SQL: The Essential Reference is for everyone who needs to access an Oracle database using SQL--developers, DBAs, designers, and managers. SQL is based on research dating back to the late 1960s, but its first commercial release was in the RDBMS announced by the fledgling Oracle Corporation in 1979. Since that time, every other database vendor has adopted SQL, and ANSI and the ISO have made it a standard. Although vendors diverge in their extensions to SQL, the core language is standard across vendor boundaries. Despite SQL's long history and relative simplicity, few developers and database administrators are truly masters of SQL. The constant stream of vendor enhancements, the hard-won experience in tuning SQL for best performance, and the requirements of particular operational environments mean that there is always more to learn about SQL. Oracle SQL: The Essential Reference delivers all the information needed to keep ahead of the learning curve on standard SQL and Oracle's extensions to it. This single, concise reference volume will hold its own against a stack of Oracle manuals and even yield insights and examples not available in those manuals. There are chapters on basic SQL elements (naming requirements, column types, pseudo-types, data conversion rules, operators); Data Definition Language (DDL) and Data Manipulation Language (DML); common language elements (constraints, storage clause, predicates); SQL functions; PL/SQL (including procedures, functions, and packages); SQL*Plus, and Oracle SQL optimization and tuning.

It is timeless virtue that creates sustainable value.\n\nThoughtful leaders are keenly aware of the enormous challenge they face to drive high performance in a world that continues to ratchet up pressure and uncertainty. Some leaders respond by getting tough and establishing strict rules. They get people in line, but they don’t inspire excellence. Wise leaders, on the other hand, help their people practice character to navigate their way through the turbulence—without lowering performance expectations. As a result, their people are more reliable under pressure.\n\nException to the Rule links ancient wisdom with contemporary science on high performance, teamwork, and engagement. Building an organizational culture based on classical virtues– of trust, compassion, courage, justice, wisdom, temperance and hope - is both strategically smart and a better way to live.\n\nException to the Rule walks you through the steps of helping everyone in your organization focus on character defined by virtue. The word virtue means excellence, which is why each one is essential to help people perform at a high level despite uncertainty and pressure. Under character--based leadership, teams work better together, creativity flourishes and engagement increases.\n\nThe most powerful idea of Exception to the Rule is this: character defined by virtue is not based on birthright; it can be learned and practiced. Everyone can develop habits to become better than they were. While character cannot be legislated, character can be cultivated.\n\nAs virtue proves its value, the culture you have can evolve into the culture you need.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9783111434384","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Walking the Footsteps of a Forgotten Revolution","authors":["Steven Nyole Fuller"],"pages":"194","publication_date":"March 2025","description":"Walking the Footsteps of a Forgotten Revolution details the bold and audacious insurrection in the opening phase of the German Revolution of 1848–1849.

Regardless of the manner in which their company's fractures manifest themselves, however, corporate leaders must find a way to rid their workplaces of the divisions that threaten to undermine their company's productivity, profits, and survival. That's why, in Unite the Tribes, bestselling author Christopher Duncan provides corporate leaders with a ten-step plan for joining their company's divided ranks together in a way that helps employees achieve their goals while also accomplishing those of the company.\n\nUsing the metaphors of the company as empire and the disparate groups that form within companies as tribes, Duncan explains that the formation of tribes within an empire is unavoidable, and to some extent, it may even be natural. After all, regardless of the situation in which they find themselves, human beings are social creatures that have aligned themselves with those whose goals and motivations match their own for centuries. The job of corporate leaders, however, is to build a cohesive, powerful, and enduring empire—which is why, in Unite the Tribes: Leadership Skills for Technology Managers, Duncan reveals:\n\nHow to build alliances and a spirit of unity across all levels of a company in order to achieve higher employee morale, greater profits, and increased productivity;\n\nHow to effectively communicate to employees the reality that their long-term prosperity as individuals operating within a company depends upon the long-term prosperity of the company itself;\n\nThe many forms of conflict that can form both within and without a organization;\n\nHow to discover what truly fulfills employees of a company and help them acquire it;\n\nAnd much more.\n\nWith Unite the Tribes as their guide, corporate leaders will learn that the way that great empires of the past have been established has been through the efforts of visionary leaders who understood that they could prevail only when they were able to convince their tribes of a simple but crucial truth: Alone, you are weak and vulnerable. United, you are invincible.\n\nWhat you'll learn\n\nReaders of Unite the Tribes will learn:\n\nPractical, down-to-earth approaches to problem solving and productivity that make sense to corporate leaders who have to do real work in the real world.\n\nHow to arrive at a plan for uniting the disparate groups that operate within their company when faced with the daily reality of office politics, maneuvering, ambition, incompetence, and short-term thinking.\n\nHow to convey the company's purpose to employees in a way that is realistic and meaningful so that all workers can contribute to the company's greater good.\n\nHow the Ten Pillars of the Empire (Vision; Leadership; Organization; Mobility; Competitiveness; Persuasion; Strategy; Brilliance; Morale; Unification) can help their employees and their company achieve their individual and joint goals.\n\nWho this book is for\n\nRegardless of the industry in which their company operates, those serving in leadership or managerial capacities (i.e., those overseeing one or more employees) at workplaces plagued with division and dysfunction will find the solutions they need to rally their employees to join forces in Unite the Tribes.

You’ll learn:\n\nThe smartest way to incorporate mentoring into your day-to-day leadership role\nThe fastest way to equip, inspire, and motivate your staff\nThe differences between mentoring, coaching, and teaching\nHow you as a leader can rate the mentors in your office – and assess the progress of mentees\n\nUsing case studies, tools, and impactful learning concepts, the authors show you how to use mentoring’s “core skills” to create a winning approach tailored to your own style, be it the “reflective mentor,” the “storytelling mentor,” or “the example-based mentor.” The book also features several appendices and FAQs, handouts, and worksheets to gauge competencies among mentors and mentees, and a blueprint with steps to set up one’s own companywide program.\n\nAs today’s biggest industry leaders continue to recognize the profound effect mentoring has on performance and profitability, there’s never been a better time to put this book’s essential tools to work for you.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9780761214274","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Leadership Skills for Managers, Fourth Edition","authors":["Charles M.

This new policy environment is driven by globalization, the neo-liberal macro-economic package of 'market enablement' and structural adjustment, which now form the dominant development paradigm. The consequences of this approach for urban development agendas and ultimately the lives and livelihoods of millions of people across the globe are profound.\n\nMarket Economy and Urban Change explores and evaluates urban sector and development policies in the context of market enablement, and the associated instruments of structural adjustment, urban management reform and 'good' governance. By articulating the linkages between this neo-liberal development paradigm and the way different actors in the urban sector enact policy responses, the book provides an understanding of both the factors driving market enablement, and its impacts on urban sector policies and programmes. With case studies drawn from countries such as Egypt, Mexico, Kenya, Brazil, Colombia and transitional economies, the book focuses in particular on the implications for land, shelter and related sectoral policies for poverty alleviation. By linking policy to practice, the book seeks to inform policy-makers in governments, donor and implementing agencies of the impact of shifts in the development debate on urban sector strategies.","tags":["Other","Politics & Global Issues"]},{"id":"9781118015551","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"From Management to Leadership: Strategies for Transforming Health, 3rd Edition","authors":["Jo Manion"],"pages":"416","publication_date":"May 2011","description":"From Management to Leadership identifies the fundamental interpersonal skills that every health care leader (and aspiring leader) needs to develop in order to be a successful executive or manager.

First has been the rise of China as a larger source of imports and production partner than Mexico. Second has been the rise of security concerns since September 11, 2001. The result has been much stronger integration between Canada and the US than with Mexico. Migration issues are now linked with security, which has risen to a top priority in the international agenda. While liberalization has furnished strong economic incentives for integration, it has not provided a sufficient guide for the political process, which requires leadership and appropriate institutions to coordinate and regulate the special interest groups.

We don't understand; what are we missing?\n\nWhat we don't see is what we can't see: we have blindspots.\n\nIt's a known fact that we're often not great judges of ourselves, even when we think we are.

Bottom line: until we uncover these blindspots, we can’t move forward or deliver on our goals as leaders.\n\nThe good news is that you can learn to do your own blindspotting.

Part I explores populism’s nature and causes, shedding light on the lure of sovereignty, the perceived representation gap and the process of radicalization, and human psychology. Part II is dedicated to observations inside the political arena, pitting liberalism and populism in a historical perspective, analyzing the risk of democratic backsliding, and asking how liberals should navigate the political need to make compromises. In Part III, the focus turns to liberal responses such as rules-based public deliberation, a liberal ethics attending to civic virtues, improved representation through the blockchain, and polycentric migration policies. Part IV, finally, houses critical engagements with influential relevant authors such as Foucault, Laclau, Berlin, and Harrington.\n\nLiberal Responses to Populism is a rich and thought-provoking read for scholars and students in political economy, political science, and political philosophy.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","Political Science"]},{"id":"9783111317854","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Memory as Power","authors":["Alex Tepperman","Paul Bleakley"],"pages":"253","publication_date":"January 2025","description":"Featuring a collection of works by scholars from across a variety of disciplines, this book outlines the principles of a critical historical criminology.

The rapid pace of change demands fast and flexible responses throughout the organization-there's no time to wait for directives from the top. And the highly-skilled workers so vital to organizational success also demand a high degree of independence. Old-fashioned command-and-control leadership is just too slow and stifling.Charles Manz and Henry Sims, Jr. pioneered the concept self-leadership in their bestselling book SuperLeadership. In The New SuperLeadership, the authors present new content and examples designed to help leaders develop the kind of autonomous, quick-reacting workforce necessary to thrive in these turbulent times. This enriched and expanded edition takes the concepts in the first edition to another level by emphasizing a pragmatic, how-to approach for developing leaders at every level of the organization.Drawing on contemporary examples and profiles, many from the high-tech and information sectors, Manz and Sims shatter the myth of the traditional, aggrandized versions of \"heroic\" leadership. They show that a leader truly becomes successful by turning followers into extraordinary self-leaders-pillars of strength that will support the organization at every level. They detail a series of action-oriented steps through which the SuperLeader provides an opportunity for followers to express and develop their own leadership skills-and in the process become highly motivated, dynamic contributors.The New SuperLeadership critically reviews traditional leadership styles, vividly illustrating the drawbacks of each: the \"Strong Man\" whose reliance on fear-based compliance smothers initiative; the \"Transactor\" who promotes a narrow \"what's in it for me?\" mentality; and the \"Visionary Hero\" whose powerful personality inspires commitment but inadvertently discourages independent thinking. By bringing out the leader in every employee, SuperLeadership enables leaders to avoid these pitfalls and develop an enthusiastic, innovative and energized workforce.The New SuperLeadership is a radically new way of looking at leadership, offering a leadership paradigm ideally suited to the realities of the modern workplace. It reveals that the only way to succeed today is to tap into the innate leadership potential that lies within every employee.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9780415630047","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"International Relations in France","authors":["Henrik Breitenbauch"],"pages":"234","publication_date":"June 2013","description":"Why is the French International Relations (IR) discipline different from the transnational-American discipline? By analysing argument structures in research articles across time, this book shows how the discipline in France is caught between the American character of the discipline and the French state as regulator of legitimate forms of expression. Concretely, French research arguments are less explicit about what their propositions are and what academic discussions they draw on and add to than their transnational-American counterparts.\n\nBased on a comparative case study of French and American IR research from 1950 to 2011, the book is a major contribution to the meta-IR literature on global, regional and national traditions of IR. The challenge to the French discipline of whether and how to position itself in relation to the evolving American discipline is in many ways exemplary for other non-American national IR disciplines, and the choices as well as the structural conditions underlying the French case are relevant to all non-Western disciplines.\n\nThe comparative analysis moreover reveals that the modern American discipline -- what is considered as recognisable social science -- takes shape only during the 1970s. The book thus offers new knowledge about the discipline's international development as such. Both case and methodology are interesting to larger audiences outside IR, in the history and sociology of social science, contrastive rhetoric, as well as French and cultural studies.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","Political Science"]},{"id":"0596002335","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Oracle RMAN Pocket Reference","authors":["Darl Kuhn","Scott Schulze"],"pages":"126","publication_date":"November 2001","description":"Oracle RMAN Pocket Reference is a handy guide for DBAs who intend to use Oracle Recovery Manager for database backup and recovery.

After a short section on RMAN architecture, the book shows (in checklist style) how to perform common backup and recovery tasks such as:\n\nImplementing a recovery catalog\nCreating and running RMAN scripts\nConfiguring input/output channels\nTaking a full database backup\nBacking up tablespaces and datafiles\nTaking incremental backups\nRecovering lost datafiles\nThe second portion of the book consists of a handy syntax reference to the many RMAN commands. Having a quick reference to RMAN commands is a great convenience to DBAs who otherwise, often under the pressure of a recovery situation, would have to wade through Oracle's online documentation.","tags":["Data","Data Engineering","Oracle Database Solutions"]},{"id":"9780071626149","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Coach Wooden's Leadership Game Plan for Success: 12 Lessons for Extraordinary Performance and Personal Excellence","authors":["John Wooden","Steve Jamison"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"April 2009","description":"“Each member of your team has the potential for personal greatness; the leader’s job is to help them achieve it.” —JOHN WOODEN\n\nCoach Wooden’s Leadership Game Plan for Success presents a unique opportunity to study under the man ESPN hails as “the greatest coach of the 20th century.” Practicing character-based leadership before the term was invented, John Wooden consistently led his legendary teams to victory and has since taught countless business leaders his fundamentals for achieving and sustaining success.\n\nNow, using this hands-on book based on the acclaimed John Wooden Leadership Course©, you can “interact” with Coach to learn and apply his philosophy of world-class leadership.

First, you must produce a quality product on schedule and on budget. Second, you must foster and encourage a cohesive, motivated, and smoothly operating team. And third, you must maintain a clear and consistent focus on short- and long-term goals, while exemplifying quality standards and showing confidence and enthusiasm for your team and its efforts. Most importantly, as a leader, you need to feel and act responsible for your team and everything that it does.\n\nAccomplishing all these goals in a way that is rewarding for the leader and the team--while producing the results that management wants--is the motivation behind the Team Software Process (TSP). Developed by renowned quality expert Watts S. Humphrey, TSP is a set of new practices and team concepts that helps developers take the CMM and CMMI Capability Maturity Models to the next level. Not only does TSP help make software more secure, it results in an average production gain of 68 percent per project. Because of their quality, timeliness, and security, TSP-produced products can be ten to hundreds of times better than other hardware or software.\n\nIn this essential guide to TSP, Humphrey uses his vast industry experience to show leaders precisely how to lead teams of software engineers trained in the Personal Software Process (PSP). He explores all aspects of effective leadership and teamwork, including building the right team for the job, the TSP launch process, following the process to produce a quality product, project reviews, and capitalizing on both the leader's and team's capabilities. Humphrey also illuminates the differences between an ineffective leader and a superb one with the objective of helping you understand, anticipate, and correct the most common leadership failings before they undermine the team.\n\nAn extensive set of appendices provides additional detail on TSP team roles and shows you how to use an organization's communication and command networks to achieve team objectives.\n\nWhether you are a new or an experienced team leader, TSPSM: Leading a Development Team provides invaluable examples, guidelines, and suggestions on how to handle the many issues you and your team face together.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781118830109","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Leading with Questions: How Leaders Find the Right Solutions by Knowing What to Ask, Revised and Updated","authors":["Michael J.

Our conversations may be full of requests and demands, but all too often we are not asking for honest and informative answers, and we don't know how to listen effectively to responses. When leaders start encouraging questions from their teams, however, they begin to see amazing results. Knowing the right questions to ask—and the right way to listen—will give any leader the skills to perform well in any situation, effectively communicate a vision to the team, and achieve lasting success across the organization.\n\nThoroughly revised and updated, Leading with Questions will help you encourage participation and teamwork, foster outside-the-box thinking, empower others, build relationships with customers, solve problems, and more. Michael Marquardt reveals how to determine which questions will lead to solutions to even the most challenging issues. He outlines specific techniques of active listening and follow-up, and helps you understand how questions can improve the way you work with individuals, teams, and organizations.\n\nThis new edition of Leading with Questions draws on interviews with thirty leaders, including eight whose stories are new to this edition. These interviews tell stories from a range of countries, including Singapore, Guyana, Korea, and Switzerland, and feature case studies from prominent firms such as DuPont, Alcoa, Novartis, and Cargill. A new chapter on problem-solving will help you apply questions to your toughest situations as a leader, and a new \"Questions for Reflection\" section at the end of each chapter will help you bring Marquardt's message into all of your work as a leader.\n\nNow more than ever, Leading with Questions is the definitive guide for becoming a stronger leader by identifying—and asking—the right questions.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781626566958","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Leadership Genius of Julius Caesar","authors":["Phillip Barlag"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"October 2016","description":"The Leadership Genius of Julius CaesarModern Lessons from the Man Who Built an Empire“Brilliantly crafted to draw leadership lessons from history, this is one of the finest leadership books I have read.”—Doris Kearns Goodwin, bestselling author of Team of Rivals and The Bully PulpitLeaders are always trying to get better, which is why there is an enormous and growing collection of literature offering the latest leadership paradigm or process. But sometimes the best way to move forward is to look back. Philip Barlag shows us that Julius Caesar is one of the most compelling leaders of the past to study—a man whose approach was surprisingly modern and extraordinarily effective. History is littered with leaders hopelessly out of touch with their people and ruthlessly pursuing their own ambitions or hedonistic whims. But Caesar, who rose from impoverished beginnings, proved by his words and deeds that he never saw himself as being above the average Roman citizen. And he had an amazing ability to generate loyalty, to turn enemies into allies and allies into devoted followers. Barlag uses dramatic and colorful incidents from Caesar's career—being held hostage by pirates, charging headlong alone into enemy lines, pardoning people he knew wanted him dead—to illustrate what Caesar can teach leaders today. Central to Barlag's argument is the distinction between force and power. Caesar avoided using brute force on his followers, understanding that fear never generates genuine loyalty. He exercised a power deeply rooted in his demonstrated personal integrity and his intuitive understanding of people's deepest needs and motivations. His supporters followed him because they wanted to, not because they were compelled to. Over 2,000 years after Caesar's death, this is still the kind of loyalty every leader wants to inspire. Barlag shows how anyone can learn to lead like Caesar.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","History"]},{"id":"9781118841303","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Courage to Execute: What elite U.S. military units can teach business about leadership and team performance","authors":["James D.

They don't understand that for many computer users, a ready-made system is about as satisfying as popping a frozen dinner in the microwave when you'd rather have real food instead. Sure, it works, but it's not exactly what you need or want. There's a lot to be said for a computer that has exactly the quality components you choose, by the manufacturers you choose, rather than the conveniently bundled assortment made for your price point. But perhaps you've stopped short of building your own because you're inexperienced or you're concerned it won't come out right. After all, you want your computer to be perfect. Hesitate no longer: Building the Perfect PC delivers end-to-end instructions (that even inexperienced PC-builders can follow) for creating your ideal machine. Written by hardware experts Robert Bruce Thompson and Barbara Fritchman Thompson, this book covers it all, beginning with the various reasons why you'd want to build your own PC, planning and picking out the components, and putting it all together. The book outlines a variety of complete systems and all of their components, including a small form factor PC; a middle-of-the-road \"sweet spot\" system with top-notch components; and a top-end gaming PC with high-end video, a fast processor, and enough RAM to make your palms sweat just thinking about it. Straightforward language, clear directions, and extensive illustrations make this guide a breeze for computer builders of any level to follow--even those with little or no experience.

The Iranian Revolution, the September 11 attacks, the ethno-religious conflicts such as the ones in the former Yugoslavia and Sri Lanka are among the many reasons for this increased focus on religion in international affairs. The rise of religious political parties across the world ranging from the Christian Democrats in Europe to Bharatiya Janata Party in India similarly illustrated religion's heightened international profile.\n\nDespite all this attention, it is challenging to situate religion within a discipline which has been dominantly secular from its inception. Only a few existent works have ventured to integrate religion into core international relations theories such as Classical Realism, Neorealism, Neoliberalism, Constructivism and the English school. This work is the first systematic attempt to comparatively assess the place of religion in the aforementioned theoretical strands of international relations with contemporary examples from around the world.\n\nWritten in an accessible and systematic fashion, this book will be an important addition to the fields of both religion and international relations.\n\nNukhet A.

And having more than one person to help decide is good because the group benefits from the collective knowledge of all of its members, and this results in better decisions. Right?\n\nBack to reality. We’ve all been involved in group decisions—and they’re hard. And they often turn out badly. Why? Many blame bad decisions on “groupthink” without a clear idea of what that term really means.\n\nNow, Nudge coauthor Cass Sunstein and leading decision-making scholar Reid Hastie shed light on the specifics of why and how group decisions go wrong—and offer tactics and lessons to help leaders avoid the pitfalls and reach better outcomes. In the first part of the book, they explain in clear and fascinating detail the distinct problems groups run into:\n\nThey often amplify, rather than correct, individual errors in judgment\nThey fall victim to cascade effects, as members follow what others say or do\nThey become polarized, adopting more extreme positions than the ones they began with\nThey emphasize what everybody knows instead of focusing on critical information that only a few people know\n\nIn the second part of the book, the authors turn to straightforward methods and advice for making groups smarter. These approaches include silencing the leader so that the views of other group members can surface, rethinking rewards and incentives to encourage people to reveal their own knowledge, thoughtfully assigning roles that are aligned with people’s unique strengths, and more.\n\nWith examples from a broad range of organizations—from Google to the CIA—and written in an engaging and witty style, Wiser will not only enlighten you; it will help your team and your organization make better decisions—decisions that lead to greater success.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9788131720349","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Sociology and Social Anthropology in India","authors":["Yogesh Atal"],"pages":"624","publication_date":"February 2009","description":"The Indian Council of Social Science Research, the premier organization for social science research in India, conducts periodic surveys in the major disciplines of the social sciences to assess disciplinary developments as well as to identify gaps in research in these disciplines.

It organizes research in a unique conceptual framework addressing two broad themes: the Essence of Humor and the Functions of Humor. Furthermore, scholars of humor have recognized that humor is not only a universal human experience, it is also inherently social, shared among people and woven into the fabric of nearly every type of interpersonal relationship.\n\nScholars across all academic disciplines have addressed questions about the essence and functions of humor at different levels of analysis relating to how narrowly or broadly they conceptualize the social context of humor. Accordingly, the editors have organized each broad thematic section into three subsections defined by level of analysis. The book first addresses questions about individual psychological processes, then discusses text properties, and finally moves to questions involving broader conceptualizations of the social context addressing humor and social relations, as well as humor and culture.\n\nBy providing a comprehensive review of foundational work as well as new research and theoretical advancements across academic disciplines, the De Gruyter Handbook of Humor Studies will serve as the foremost authoritative research handbook for experienced humor scholars as well as an essential starting point for newcomers to the field, such as graduate students seeking to conduct their own research on humor. Further, by highlighting the interdisciplinary interest of new and emerging areas of research the book identifies and defines directions for future research for scholars from every discipline that contributes to our understanding of humor.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences"]},{"id":"9780072230666","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Oracle Database 10g PL/SQL Programming","authors":["Scott Urman","Ron Hardman","Michael McLaughlin"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"October 2004","description":"Create dynamic client/server applications using PL/SQL and the comprehensive information contained in this authoritative volume.

Education is perfectly placed to create the conditions for innovative and imaginative solutions and to provide the formulas that ensure that everyone becomes naturally smart; but to achieve this, we need to recognise that an education that is not grounded in a full understanding of our relationship with the natural world is no education at all. In other words, a total transformation of schools and schooling is needed.\n\nWhile acknowledging that the ecological crisis is global in scale, Paul Clarke maintains that many of the solutions are already evident in our local communities. Drawing on innovative sustainable living programmes from around the world, including Sweden’s Forest Schools, China’s Green Schools programme, the US Green Ribbon Schools programme and his own school-of-sustainability project, Paul Clarke offers practical solutions about how schools and communities can make their contribution.\n\nThis book examines how we might proceed to empower and actively develop schools and communities to connect hand, heart and mind for an eco-literate future. It is thought provoking, timely and challenging, and should be read by school leaders, community and business leaders, as well as anyone grappling with the problems of transition from an industrial past to an ecologically sustainable future.","tags":["Other","Education"]},{"id":"9780132597401","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"The Home Owner's Guide to Taking Control of Your Money","authors":["Farnoosh Torabi"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"November 2010","description":"Should you buy your first home?

How to:1. Lead Yourself - by having a clear understanding of the personal journey you wish to make and how it will be managed. Once you are able to lead yourself along this journey, you will be more able to;2. Lead Others - by delivering results that are grounded in the principle of shared rather than selfish success - ultimately 'shared success sustains success'.Both forms of leadership rely on your ability to operate from a position where your personal security comes from within. Once you understand the principles contained in this book - no longer will the idea of insecurity be seen as a negative and worrying word. Instead, in-security will mean what it says - that your personal security comes from within. Having this security means it is yours to do with as you please and no one can take it away from you. And as a result you are free to enlarge and enhance the level and value of your personal security by investing your security in other people.\n\nIf you work for an organisation, the Lead Yourself framework will help to move from a position of Corporate Slavery to Corporate Success. If you work on your own, or wish to launch out and start your own business, this book will give you the framework and tools to help to achieve your goals, and how to take others with you.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781843346906","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Leadership in Academic and Public Libraries","authors":["Petra Düren"],"pages":"216","publication_date":"September 2013","description":"In a time when libraries have to face constant change, this book provides examples and advises on how to lead when change is needed (for example, when quality management is implemented or when libraries have to merge or to relocate).

As college student populations and environments continually change, so must the practices of the professionals who work with them. This volume highlights some of the most recent practices and perspectives in ethics and cultural competence for all college and university personnel.\n\nThis volume is unique and valuable because other books have addressed culturally competent ethical practices for discrete professions within higher education, no single work has a collection of writings about ethical and culturally competent practices for a variety of the professions in higher education.","tags":["Other","Education"]},{"id":"9781466512467","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Cargo Crime","authors":["John J.

It is both a guide for conducting critical discourse analysis and a look at how the authors, alongside their teacher education students, used the tools of discourse analysis to inquire into, critique, and design critical literacy practices. Through an intimate look at the workings of a university teacher education course and the discourse analysis tools that teacher-researchers use to understand their classrooms, the book provides examples of both pre-service teachers and teacher educators becoming critically literate. The context-rich examples highlight the ways in which discourse analysis aids teachers’ decision making in the moment and reflections on their practice over time. Readers learn to conduct discourse analysis as they read about critical literacy practices at the university level.\n\nDesigned to be interactive, each chapter features step-by-step procedures for conducting each kind of discourse analysis (narrative, critically oriented, multimodal), sample analyses, and additional readings and resources.

But today's vastly complex, globalized, and fast-evolving world requires a different kind of leadership. This game-changing book details a new approach—entrepreneurial leadership—developed at Babson College, the number-one school for entrepreneurship in the world. Entrepreneurial leadership is inspired by, but is separate from, entrepreneurship. It can be applied in any organizational situation, not just start-ups. Based on two years of extensive research, it embraces three principles that add up to a fundamentally new worldview of business and a new logic of decision making. First, rapid change and increasing uncertainty require leaders to be “cognitively ambidextrous,” able to shift between traditional “prediction logic” (choosing actions based on analysis) and “creation logic” (taking action despite considerable unknowns). Guiding this different way of thinking and acting is a new view of business, where simultaneous creation of social, environmental, and economic value is the order of the day. Finally, entrepreneurial leaders leverage their understanding of themselves and their social context to guide effective action. Each chapter offers concrete examples of how educators across all disciplines are integrating these ideas into their courses—and even their entire curricula. The New Entrepreneurial Leader lays out a comprehensive new paradigm for reinventing management education in order to mold leaders who will shape social and economic opportunity.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781000861464","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Successful Supervisory Leadership","authors":["William J.

It also looks forward to a range of ‘expert futures’ in which expert groups and organizations decline in power and status as their prevalence proliferates to a stage where they become ubiquitous in neoliberal regimes.

It is timeless virtue that creates sustainable value.\n\nThoughtful leaders are keenly aware of the enormous challenge they face to drive high performance in a world that continues to ratchet up pressure and uncertainty. Some leaders respond by getting tough and establishing strict rules. They get people in line, but they don’t inspire excellence. Wise leaders, on the other hand, help their people practice character to navigate their way through the turbulence—without lowering performance expectations. As a result, their people are more reliable under pressure.\n\nException to the Rule links ancient wisdom with contemporary science on high performance, teamwork, and engagement. Building an organizational culture based on classical virtues– of trust, compassion, courage, justice, wisdom, temperance and hope - is both strategically smart and a better way to live.\n\nException to the Rule walks you through the steps of helping everyone in your organization focus on character defined by virtue. The word virtue means excellence, which is why each one is essential to help people perform at a high level despite uncertainty and pressure. Under character--based leadership, teams work better together, creativity flourishes and engagement increases.\n\nThe most powerful idea of Exception to the Rule is this: character defined by virtue is not based on birthright; it can be learned and practiced. Everyone can develop habits to become better than they were. While character cannot be legislated, character can be cultivated.\n\nAs virtue proves its value, the culture you have can evolve into the culture you need.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9783110353938","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Redeeming Laughter, 2nd Edition","authors":["Peter L.

While most studies agree on the analysis of predicative clauses, specificational clauses have sparked much debate. A key concern is how specificational clauses with indefinite ‘variable’ NP (e.g. \"A popular holiday go-to is Rome\") compare to, and contrast with, other copular clauses, especially specificational clauses with definite ‘variable’ NP (e.g. \"The main can’t-miss in Italy is Rome\") and predicative clauses with indefinite predicate nominative (e.g. \"Rome is a great city\"). This book addresses this concern by offering a functional-structural analysis of these three clause types in terms of their common characteristics and distinguishing features. The analysis of the clauses’ structure and meaning is substantiated by evidence from corpus research which probes into various aspects of their actual usage (e.g. information structure and prosody, discourse-embedding). In doing so, the book offers an empirical basis for testing existing assumptions about predicative and specificational clauses, while also providing new insights into the interaction between the grammar and discourse usage of copular clauses.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","Linguistics"]},{"id":"9781118173213","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Art of Being Unreasonable: Lessons in Unconventional Thinking","authors":["Eli Broad"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"May 2012","description":"Unorthodox success principles from a billionaire entrepreneur and philanthropist\n\nEli Broad's embrace of \"unreasonable thinking\" has helped him build two Fortune 500 companies, amass personal billions, and use his wealth to create a new approach to philanthropy.

Will you pass the test?\n\nDespite all the effort through the years to understand what it takes to be an effective leader, the challenges of leadership remain enormously difficult and elusive; even today, most CEOs don't last five years in the job. The demands to deliver at a consistently high level can be unforgiving.\n\nThe loneliness. The weight of responsibility. The relentless second-guessing and criticism. The pressure to build all-star teams. The 24/7 schedule that requires superhuman stamina. The tough decisions that often leave no one happy. The expectation to always have the right answer when it can be hard just to know the right question.\n\nThese challenges are brought into their highest and sharpest relief in the corner office, but they are hardly unique to chief executives. All leaders face their own version of these tests, and the authors draw on the distilled wisdom, stories, and lessons from hundreds of chief executives to show how every aspiring leader can master these challenges and lead like a CEO. These foundational leadership skills will make all aspiring executives more effective in their roles today and lift the trajectory of their careers.\n\nThe CEO Test is the authoritative, no-nonsense insider's guide to navigating leadership's toughest challenges, brought to you by authors uniquely qualified to tell the stories.

Lead Others - by delivering results that are grounded in the principle of shared rather than selfish success - ultimately 'shared success sustains success'.Both forms of leadership rely on your ability to operate from a position where your personal security comes from within. Once you understand the principles contained in this book - no longer will the idea of insecurity be seen as a negative and worrying word. Instead, in-security will mean what it says - that your personal security comes from within. Having this security means it is yours to do with as you please and no one can take it away from you.

Take heed. Author and serial CEO Dick Cross pulls back the curtain on this top leadership role, explaining in his new book that being a successful leader, running a business, and doing it extraordinarily well isn’t a full-time job. How do you successfully lead and run a business? The answer may surprise you. Cross suggests that the most important, and often overlooked, duty for a CEO is thinking about how to improve his or her business and how to be a leader. In 60-Minute CEO, Cross explains that the essential elements of the CEO role can be accomplished in several 60-minute sessions every week. Executives may fill their time with other tasks, but leading and running a company requires explicit skills different from those needed for any other corporate position. The good news is that those skills are easy to learn, fun to do, and not time-consuming. In an entertaining style, Cross offers executives the fast track to the top leadership position, focusing on two aspects: thinking and character. And while 60 minutes may seem like a quick fix, as Cross sees it, three 60-minute sessions a week devoted solely to considering your business and your role as leader are crucial to business and leadership success—and the payoff is proven. In 60-Minute CEO, Dick Cross brings over 25 years of experience of transforming companies in various stages of underperformance into industry powerhouses. Cross combines his knowledge and experience with the stories and lessons of preeminent leaders and thinkers including General George Patton and Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9780123744869","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Introduction to Pattern Recognition: A Matlab Approach","authors":["Sergios Theodoridis","Aggelos Pikrakis","Konstantinos Koutroumbas"],"pages":"150","publication_date":"March 2010","description":"Matlab booklet to accompany Theodoridis, Pattern Recognition 4e.

The archaeologist Schliemann’s dubious profiteering in America is exposed. Two contemporary scholars describe how they moved to enrich their career horizons (Ludwig, Shanzer).

By adopting a discourse analytical perspective which combines both qualitative and quantitative approaches, the book explores the hybridity of new genres and communicative processes. It provides an interdisciplinary platform for researchers, practitioners, and educators to present the most recent innovations, trends, and concerns, as well as any solutions already adopted in their professional areas.

The book includes recent research-based ideas in the field of higher education.\n\nTopics include cultural competencies for higher education faculty, professionals, and administrators, such as use of language in communicating concepts to students for whom English is not a first language, avoiding imposition of bias, encouraging exposition of perspective, and ethical practices for professionals working with the diverse environments and populations in higher education settings.\n\nThis work is particularly important since becoming informed on the latest approaches and ideologies is an essential component of both professional preparation and continuing professional development of faculty, professionals, and administrators in higher education. Currently, education practitioners struggle with finding time for professional development and ways to inform themselves of the latest research. This volume will help education practitioners keep abreast of the most important recent research. As college student populations and environments continually change, so must the practices of the professionals who work with them. This volume highlights some of the most recent practices and perspectives in ethics and cultural competence for all college and university personnel.\n\nThis volume is unique and valuable because other books have addressed culturally competent ethical practices for discrete professions within higher education, no single work has a collection of writings about ethical and culturally competent practices for a variety of the professions in higher education.","tags":["Other","Education"]},{"id":"9781430245605","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Lobbyists at Work","authors":["Beth L.

Leech's probing questions reflect her years of research tracking the real impact of money and influence on policy.\" —Thomas Hale Boggs, Jr. (Chairman, Patton Boggs LLP)\n\nReceived wisdom has it that lobbyists run the American government on behalf of moneyed interests. But what makes lobbyists run, and how do they induce legislators and bureaucrats to do their bidding? These are questions for which even the harshest critics lack satisfying answers. Lobbyists at Work explores what lobbyists really do and why. It goes behind the scenes and brings back in-depth interviews with fifteen political advocates chosen to represent the breadth and diversity of the lobbying profession.\n\nThe interviewees profiled in this book range from the top lobbyists-for-hire at the most powerful K Street firms to pro bono lobbyists for the disenfranchised and powerless. The roster spans all types of lobbyists working for all types of clients and seeking to influence all levels and branches of government. The permutations include business-lobbying-government, government-lobbying-government, government-to-business revolving door, regulatory lobbying, state and local lobbying, citizen-advocacy lobbying,single-issue lobbying, and multiple-issue lobbying. In colorful and sometimes hilarious detail, the interviewees take the reader through their arsenals of traditional and next-generation lobbying techniques, including face-to-face persuasion of elected officials and their staffs, educational campaigns and coalition-building, ghost-drafting complex legislation and regulation for government committees and agencies, contributions, and social media campaigns.\n\nIn Lobbyists at Work, the normally self-effacing subjects open up about themselves and their profession: why they chose to become lobbyists, what motivates them to keep lobbying, how they cultivate their lobbying influence, how they adjust to changes in the rules affecting their lobbying methods, and what they actually do at work each day (and night). As an authority on lobbying respected in Washington for her impartiality, Professor Beth Leech elicits frank disclosures, career tips, and riveting stories about the good, the bad, and the ambivalent on both sides of the symbiotic relationship between government officials and lobbyists.\n\nWhat you'll learn\n\nAs a result of reading Lobbyists at Work, you will learn:\n\nwhat lobbyists really do and to what extent the stereotypes about lobbyists are warranted (if you are a general reader)\n\nexpert tips on how to multiply your political influence (if you are a citizen activist)\n\nwhat types of lobbying jobs are available and how different types of lobbyists spend their workdays (if you aspire to be a lobbyist)\n\nhow to manage and build your lobbying career (if you are already a lobbyist)\n\nHoward Marlowe, The Lobbyists' Lobbyist\n\nRobert Walker, Former Congressman Lobbyist\n\nNick Allard, Patton Boggs Lobbyist\n\nJulie Stewart, Single-Issue Citizen Advocate\n\nLaura Murphy, ACLU Rights Lobbyist\n\nLyle Dennis, Specialty Lobbyist\n\nDale Florio, State House Lobbyist\n\nChristina Mulvihill, Corporate Lobbyist\n\nLeslie Harris, Internet Freedom Lobbyist\n\nMark Burnham, State University Lobbyist\n\nDanielle Her Many Horses, Native American Gaming Lobbyist\n\nTimothy Richardson, Police Officers' Lobbyist\n\nJonathan Schleifer, Educational Change Lobbyist\n\nFaith Shapiro, ACLU Intern; Angela Guo, CAP Action Intern\n\nCraig Holman, Public Citizen Lobbyist\n\nWho this book is for\n\nLobbyists at Work appeals to a broad readership, including all American citizens who are alarmed by news coverage of the outsized role of influence-mongering on our system of government and want to dig deeper; students of politics, especially in courses focusing on interest groups; prospective lobbyists finishing their degrees or already working in politics; and the 200,000 lobbyists operating today in the United States.","tags":["Other","Politics & Global Issues"]},{"id":"9781119895244","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Leading with Vulnerability","authors":["Jacob Morgan"],"pages":"288","publication_date":"October 2023","description":"How do some of the world’s top leaders unlock the potential of others, create trust, and lead through change?\n\nJacob started out with one basic question: Is vulnerability the same for leaders as it is for everyone else? It turns out that it’s not. On August 20, 1991, Hollis Harris, the CEO of struggling Continental Airlines told his 42,000 employees to pray for the future of the company. The next day he was fired. What Hollis did was vulnerable, but it was not leadership.\n\nWhile vulnerability cripples some leaders, others tap into it and use it as a superpower. Vulnerability alone makes leaders seem incompetent. Competence on its own makes it hard for leaders to connect with their people. The key is to develop both competence and vulnerability, what Jacob calls “The Vulnerable Leader Equation.”\n\nBased on over 100 CEO interviews and a survey of nearly 14,000 employees, renowned leadership thought leader and futurist Jacob Morgan shares candid stories and original research that shows how leaders can tap into vulnerability to transform themselves, their teams, and their organizations.\n\nThis book will show you why it’s so crucial to lead with vulnerability and how to do it well. You will learn:\n\nThe difference between being vulnerable and leading with vulnerability\nThe 5 vulnerable leader superheroes\nWhat makes leaders feel most vulnerable at work and why\nThe ROI of leading with vulnerability\nThe 8 attributes of vulnerable leaders\nWhat happens when vulnerability is used against you\nHow to climb the “vulnerability mountain”\nWhat keeps leaders from being vulnerable at work and how to overcome it\n\nLeading With Vulnerability is not just a book to share with your leaders and your co-workers. It's an invitation to a paradigm-shifting adventure. Nothing like this has been written before and, after reading it, you’ll never look at leadership the same way again.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9780768682632","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Build It.

And having more than one person to help decide is good because the group benefits from the collective knowledge of all of its members, and this results in better decisions. Right?\n\nBack to reality. We’ve all been involved in group decisions—and they’re hard. And they often turn out badly. Why? Many blame bad decisions on “groupthink” without a clear idea of what that term really means.\n\nNow, Nudge coauthor Cass Sunstein and leading decision-making scholar Reid Hastie shed light on the specifics of why and how group decisions go wrong—and offer tactics and lessons to help leaders avoid the pitfalls and reach better outcomes. In the first part of the book, they explain in clear and fascinating detail the distinct problems groups run into:\n\nThey often amplify, rather than correct, individual errors in judgment\nThey fall victim to cascade effects, as members follow what others say or do\nThey become polarized, adopting more extreme positions than the ones they began with\nThey emphasize what everybody knows instead of focusing on critical information that only a few people know\n\nIn the second part of the book, the authors turn to straightforward methods and advice for making groups smarter. These approaches include silencing the leader so that the views of other group members can surface, rethinking rewards and incentives to encourage people to reveal their own knowledge, thoughtfully assigning roles that are aligned with people’s unique strengths, and more.\n\nWith examples from a broad range of organizations—from Google to the CIA—and written in an engaging and witty style, Wiser will not only enlighten you; it will help your team and your organization make better decisions—decisions that lead to greater success.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781466512467","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Cargo Crime","authors":["John J.

It is both a guide for conducting critical discourse analysis and a look at how the authors, alongside their teacher education students, used the tools of discourse analysis to inquire into, critique, and design critical literacy practices. Through an intimate look at the workings of a university teacher education course and the discourse analysis tools that teacher-researchers use to understand their classrooms, the book provides examples of both pre-service teachers and teacher educators becoming critically literate. The context-rich examples highlight the ways in which discourse analysis aids teachers’ decision making in the moment and reflections on their practice over time. Readers learn to conduct discourse analysis as they read about critical literacy practices at the university level.\n\nDesigned to be interactive, each chapter features step-by-step procedures for conducting each kind of discourse analysis (narrative, critically oriented, multimodal), sample analyses, and additional readings and resources. By attending to the micro-interactions as well as processes that unfold across time, the book illustrates the power and potential of discourse analysis as a pedagogical and research tool.","tags":["Other","Education"]},{"id":"9789332510456","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"21 Success Sutras for Leaders","authors":["M.

While most studies agree on the analysis of predicative clauses, specificational clauses have sparked much debate. A key concern is how specificational clauses with indefinite ‘variable’ NP (e.g. \"A popular holiday go-to is Rome\") compare to, and contrast with, other copular clauses, especially specificational clauses with definite ‘variable’ NP (e.g. \"The main can’t-miss in Italy is Rome\") and predicative clauses with indefinite predicate nominative (e.g. \"Rome is a great city\"). This book addresses this concern by offering a functional-structural analysis of these three clause types in terms of their common characteristics and distinguishing features. The analysis of the clauses’ structure and meaning is substantiated by evidence from corpus research which probes into various aspects of their actual usage (e.g. information structure and prosody, discourse-embedding). In doing so, the book offers an empirical basis for testing existing assumptions about predicative and specificational clauses, while also providing new insights into the interaction between the grammar and discourse usage of copular clauses.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","Linguistics"]},{"id":"9781906465438","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Liquid Leadership: Inspirational lessons from the world's great leaders","authors":["Damian Hughes"],"pages":"200","publication_date":"June 2009","description":"A practical, jargon-free and easily accessible book on making a difference as a leader, Damian Hughes’ Liquid Leadership draws on a diverse list of leaders in everyday life (Kim England, National Sales Training Manager at Unilever), to showbiz celebrities (John Lennon, Walt Disney), to renowned historical leaders (Shackleton, Eisenhower, Steve Jobs). \n\nThere are no stuffy theories here.

Reappraising State-Owned Enterprise deals with a topic often undervalued in the past decade but which now, with the crisis of 2008-2009, calls for greater attention: the direct intervention of the State as Entrepreneur.\n\nThe collection of essays in this volume – prepared by some of the leading authorities in the field – offers a contribution to this debate by providing a balanced assessment of two of the most relevant experiences of mixed economies, the United Kingdom and Italy. In this respect, a comparison between these two countries is very much appropriate since in both nations the State played an important role as \"Entrepreneur\" starting in the early 20th century. In Great Britain and Italy, the heyday of the \"State as Entrepreneur\" was in the years right after WWII when it was used as a tool for promoting a modern society in which citizens acquired a stronger sense of belonging to their nations.\n\nThe UK and Italy saw the State take on a too-pervasive role in the 70s; the two nations responded in different ways. In the 1980s Great Britain embarked on a harsh process of privatizations while Italians struggled on until finally submitting to privatizations in their nation in the following decade. The deep crisis of the final years of the 21st century forced both nations to reconsider State interventions as an appropriate tool in order to protect the wellbeing of the national economy.","tags":["Other","Politics & Global Issues"]},{"id":"9781562865511","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Tailored Learning: Designing the Blend That Fits","authors":["Jennifer Hofmann","Nanette Miner"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"May 2009","description":"Tailored Learning addresses today's completely changed training realities in a unique way.

What factors account for different economic performance among states that are vulnerable to external shocks, crony capitalism, and political instability? This book argues that the answer lies in the structuring of state power, specifically the way different sets of governing elites – political leaders and economic technocrats – are embedded in political organisations and state institutions, and the way these elites relate to each other in the economic development policy process. Conducting a comparative historical analysis of Thailand and the Philippines, the book argues that the institutional settings of governing elites influence economic outcomes. In Thailand, political power traditionally connects to state institutions in ways that has limited the impact of political turnovers and global downturns - conducive to long-term industrial activities. In contrast, Philippine state power derives from family networks that merge social and political power, suited to fast-moving, short-term commercial interests. In focusing on this political and institutional story, the author analyses the current development dilemmas of countries, weighed down by historical legacies of unstable regimes, dependency, and social conflict, and how they are likely to develop in the future.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","Political Science"]},{"id":"9781118004357","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"TouchPoints: Creating Powerful Leadership Connections in the Smallest of Moments","authors":["Mette Norgaard","Douglas R.

Through previously untold stories from Conant's tenure as CEO of Campbell Soup Company and Norgaard's vast consulting experience, the authors show that a leader's impact and legacy are built through hundreds, even thousands, of interactive moments in time.

Leadership mastery in the smallest and otherwise ordinary moments can transform aimless activity in individuals and entropy in organizations into focused energy—one magical moment at a time.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781422137277","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Collaboration: How Leaders Avoid the Traps, Build Common Ground, and Reap Big Results","authors":["Morten Hansen"],"pages":"256","publication_date":"May 2009","description":"In Collaboration, author Morten Hansen takes aim at what many leaders inherently know: in today's competitive environment, companywide collaboration is an imperative for successful strategy execution, yet the sought-after synergies are rarely, if ever, realized.

Unleadership exposes the potential that is unleashed when members of the community discover their own power to act and reclaim what they have delegated to their leaders.\n\nBased on extensive research, the authors highlight the flourishing of alternative forms of leading that encourage rethinking ideas of leadership and followership. They provide practical guidance to organisations and practitioners for enriching their leaderly capacity and cultivating unleadership practices to co-exist with and complement leadership practices.\n\nUnleadership is an invaluable resource for leaders and managers in public and private organisations as well as students of leadership and organisational development.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781848219120","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"The Art of War in the Network Age","authors":["Joseph Henrotin"],"pages":"238","publication_date":"October 2016","description":"Previous studies have looked at the contribution of information technology and network theory to the art of warfare as understood in the broader sense.

Learning transforms people's lives, and teaching, in any forum, is the art and science of bringing out the brilliance that drives those transformations.”Or it should be. But what often happens is that people who teach—in classrooms, meetings, workshops, coaching sessions, or any other setting where learning happens—don't know how to transfer their great content to others effectively. They spend 70 percent of their time on what they are teaching and only 30 percent on how to teach it, when it should be the other way around. Halsey is here to reverse that equation, laying out a comprehensive instructional design model that deeply engages and energizes learners because it focuses not on how smart they are but on how they are smart. She shows how to create content that is clear, relevant, easily absorbed, and readily retained because it is tailored to each participant's specific needs, abilities, and inclinations. Halsey's six-step ENGAGE Model replaces the old “sit 'n' get” model with “woo 'n' do”—learners are actively drawn in and perform activities that reinforce the learning. She presents hundreds of proven ideas, strategies, and practices that will enable you to Energize learners at the beginning of any learning session; help them Navigate the new content and Generate personal meaning and relevance from it; Apply their learning to the real world; Gauge and celebrate their progress; and Extend their learning to action. Brilliance by Design offers a systematic way to reach joyfully into the soul of learners and facilitate their brilliance so they can make a positive difference in the world.","tags":["Other","Education","Instructional Design"]},{"id":"9781853837845","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Market Economy and Urban Change","authors":["Mohamed Hamza","Roger Zetter"],"pages":"224","publication_date":"June 2013","description":"Across the developing world the preceding decade or so has witnessed a profound reconfiguration of the political economy of urban policy. This new policy environment is driven by globalization, the neo-liberal macro-economic package of 'market enablement' and structural adjustment, which now form the dominant development paradigm. The consequences of this approach for urban development agendas and ultimately the lives and livelihoods of millions of people across the globe are profound.\n\nMarket Economy and Urban Change explores and evaluates urban sector and development policies in the context of market enablement, and the associated instruments of structural adjustment, urban management reform and 'good' governance. By articulating the linkages between this neo-liberal development paradigm and the way different actors in the urban sector enact policy responses, the book provides an understanding of both the factors driving market enablement, and its impacts on urban sector policies and programmes. With case studies drawn from countries such as Egypt, Mexico, Kenya, Brazil, Colombia and transitional economies, the book focuses in particular on the implications for land, shelter and related sectoral policies for poverty alleviation. By linking policy to practice, the book seeks to inform policy-makers in governments, donor and implementing agencies of the impact of shifts in the development debate on urban sector strategies.","tags":["Other","Politics & Global Issues"]},{"id":"9780415823531","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"North American Integration","authors":["Gaspare M.

First has been the rise of China as a larger source of imports and production partner than Mexico. Second has been the rise of security concerns since September 11, 2001. The result has been much stronger integration between Canada and the US than with Mexico. Migration issues are now linked with security, which has risen to a top priority in the international agenda. While liberalization has furnished strong economic incentives for integration, it has not provided a sufficient guide for the political process, which requires leadership and appropriate institutions to coordinate and regulate the special interest groups. A coherent and effective North American integration would be a valuable asset in the context of global integration and competition, yet the issues involved are quite complex and varied.\n\nNorth American Integration: An Institutional Void in Migration, Security and Development\n\n examines the current state of North American integration.

More than ever, we need leaders who understand how compassion connects them with their employees, stakeholders and wider communities. Yet compassion in organisations is often misunderstood, with many leaders reluctant to embrace it lest they appear weak.\n\nCompassionate Leadership draws on new and established research in psychology, behavioural science, neuropsychology and leadership theory to show that compassion, when correctly understood and applied is, in fact, a formidable and sustainable force for positive leadership.\n\nThis book explores the common myths, pitfalls, and concerns about leading with a compassionate approach. It discusses the leadership, organisational and individual benefits of compassion and shows how leaders can design an organisation which establishes, then reinforces, a compassionate culture.\n\nA practical guide, this book provides evidence-based tools, appraisals, and frameworks which emphasise everyday applications that leaders, managers, and business students can adopt both individually and for their organisations.\n\nCompassionate Leadership presents a new model of compassion, an approach based on multidisciplinary research in a variety of organisational settings. It gives leaders a theoretical and practical underpinning they can use for deeper reflection and personal growth to turn their new-found knowledge into action.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781292362199","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Brilliant Teaching Assistant","authors":["Louise Burnham"],"pages":"240","publication_date":"July 2020","description":"Louise Burnham currently works as an early years and primary teacher.

The reason is simple: no matter what you think you're saying, your words, gestures, and tone of voice can actually communicate something entirely different.\n\nToo often, negative micromessages undermine morale, business opportunities, and ultimately your organization. Micromessaging examines the nuanced behaviors that we all blindly use and react to in our dealings with others.

Learning how to constructively address these behaviors can bring about positive change.\n\nYoung offers a common language for encouraging open discussion in the workplace, along with skills to identify and address familiar micromessages; tools for deploying microadvantages; and real-life workplace scenarios, self-assessments, and solutions that help readers interpret and alter ingrained behaviors and their effects.

The underlying illness, says Business Ethics magazine founder Marjorie Kelly, is shareholder primacy: the corporate drive to make profits for shareholders, no matter who pays the cost.In The Divine Right of Capital, Kelly argues that focusing on the interests of stockholders to the exclusion of everyone else's interests is a form of discrimination based on property or wealth. She shows how this bias is held by our institutional structures, much as they once held biases against blacks and women.The Divine Right of Capital exposes six aristocratic principles that corporations are built on, principles that we would never accept in our modern democratic society but which we accept unquestioningly in our economy. Wealth bias is a holdover from our pre-democratic past. It has enabled shareholders to become a kind of economic aristocracy. Kelly shows how to design more equitable alternatives-new property rights, new forms of corporate governance, new ways of looking at corporate performance-that build on both free-market and democratic principles.We think of shareholder primacy as the natural law of the free market, much as our forebears thought of monarchy as the most natural form of government. But in The Divine Right of Capital, Kelly brilliantly demonstrates that it is no more \"natural\" than any other human creation. People designed this system and people can change it.We need a change of mind as profound as that of the American Revolution. We must question the legitimacy of a system that gives the wealthy few-the ten percent of Americans who own ninety percent of all stock-a disproportionate power over the many. In so doing, we can fulfill the democratic principles of our nation not only in the political sphere, but in the economic sphere as well.","tags":["Other","Politics & Global Issues"]},{"id":"9780071833189","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Master Competitive Analytics with Oracle Endeca Information Discovery","authors":["Helen Sun","William Smith"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"September 2014","description":"Oracle Endeca Information Discovery Best Practices\n\nMaximize the powerful capabilities of this self-service enterprise data discovery platform.

The risks are a combination of familiar censorship tactics applied in novel ways, and the exertion of pressure through unconventional means or at unprecedented levels. These censorship efforts range from withholding advertising to online trolling, website blocking to physical harassment, imprisonment to the murder of journalists.\n\nIn the Americas, governments and non-state actors use new, sometimes subtle ways to limit journalists' ability to investigate wrongdoing. In Europe, authorities deploy intelligence services to intimidate the press in the name of national security. In Asia, governments block access to information online, and in some cases, punish those who manage to get around the obstacles. And throughout the world, terror groups are using the threat of targeted murder to compel journalists to refrain from covering crucial stories or otherwise self-censor.\n\nAttacks on the Press documents how these new forms of censorship are perpetrated and provides journalists with guidance on how to work around them, when possible, and how to ensure their own safety as well as the safety of their sources and people with whom they work. The book enables readers to:\n\nExamine the state of free media around the world\nLearn which nations violate press freedom with impunity\nDiscover the most dangerous beats and regions\nDelve inside specific, increasingly complex challenges\n\nCPJ's mission is to defend the rights of journalists to report the news without fear of reprisal. Attacks on the Press provides a platform for direct advocacy with governments and the diplomatic community, for giving voice to journalists globally, and for ensuring that those journalists have a seat in discussions at the United Nations, the Organization of American States, the European Union, the African Union, and others.","tags":["Other","Politics & Global Issues"]},{"id":"9781592535484","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Design School Confidential","authors":["Steven Heller","Lita Talarico"],"pages":"224","publication_date":"October 2009","description":"Every great design school in the world is defined, in part, by the work of its students at any given time.

Yet sweeping changes were underway. In l958 Congress awarded the new state over 100 million acres to promote economic development. In 1971, it gave Native groups more than 40 million acres to settle land claims and facilitate the building of an 800-mile oil pipeline. Spurred by the newly militant environmental movement, it also began to consider the preservation of Alaska's magnificent scenery and wildlife. Northern Landscapes is an essential guide to Alaska's recent past and to contemporary local and national debates over the future of public lands and resources. It is the first comprehensive examination of the campaign to preserve wild Alaska through the creation of a vast system of parks and wildlife refuges. Drawing on archival sources and interviews, Daniel Nelson traces disputes over resources alongside the politics of the Alaska statehood movement. He provides in-depth coverage of the growth of Alaskan environmental organizations, their partnerships with national groups, and their participation in political campaigns into the 1970s and after. Engagingly written, Northern Landscapes focuses on efforts to persuade public officials to recognize the value of Alaska's mountains, forests, and wildlife. That activity culminated in the passage of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) of 1980, which set aside more than 100 million acres, doubling the size of the national park and wildlife refuge systems, and tripling the size of the wilderness preservation system. Arguably the single greatest triumph of environmentalism, ANILCA also set the stage for continuing battles over the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and Alaska's national forests.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","History"]},{"id":"9780470636749","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Closing the Execution Gap: How Great Leaders and Their Companies Get Results","authors":["Richard Lepsinger"],"pages":"253","publication_date":"June 2010","description":"Praise for Closing the Execution Gap\n\n\"I got half way through the introduction and was hooked.

It focuses on the legacy of Irawati Karve (1905-1970), a Indian anthropologist trained at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Anthropology, Eugenics, and Human Heredity in Berlin, Germany (1927-1930) and a prominent scientist in post-colonial India. Besides a historical analysis of Karve’s adaptation of racial approaches to the study of Indian castes, the book applies material-semiotic and ethnographic lenses to examine how her work is taken up today in anthropology and population genetics. By showing how transnational and transcolonial entanglements in race science shape knowledge on human diversity in India, the book offers novel insights to discussions in anthropology, STS, and global history, including the racialization of difference, colonial legacies, and post-colonial sovereignty in science. It contributes to a better understanding of the co-constitution of politics and sciences of human diversity and it argues for a closer attention to inequalities as a way to de-link from the legacies of scientific racism.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences"]},{"id":"9781398618213","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Designing Accessible Learning Content, 2nd Edition","authors":["Susi Miller"],"pages":"408","publication_date":"January 2025","description":"Use this guide to understand how to design inclusive and accessible learning content that works for everyone.","tags":["Other","Education","Instructional Design"]},{"id":"9781492046219","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Your Critical First 10 Days as a Leader","authors":["Eric J.

Regardless of their titles and nominal responsibilities, they will confront situations in which they have insufficient influence and authority to get their job done effectively. Fortunately, two strategies can almost always help the sidelined executive capture more clout and build an enduring power base.A variety of situations can lead a manager into a power deficit. Demographics (race, ethnicity, gender or age) can contribute to the power-deficient executive’s predicament, as can inexperience, poor reputation, personality, background, training or outlook. It can happen to people with high potential. It can even happen to executives who are already high performers.Typically, an executive winds up with a power deficit because he or she lacks one or more of the following power sources: legitimacy, critical resources or networks. The high level of interaction between these three sources of power means that a shortage in one can easily produce shortages in the other two.The authors argue that, generally, executives who have a power deficit can solve the problem in one of two ways: they must either play the game more effectively or change the game by, for instance, reshaping their role in the organization. The authors offer examples and recommendations and provide a short questionnaire to help managers identify potential power deficits.The good news is that the odds of success are good. The authors report that in their coaching work with 179 executives who wrestled with power deficits, only four failed to improve the situation.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781593271497","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Practical Packet Analysis","authors":["Chris Sanders"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"May 2007","description":"It's easy enough to install Wireshark and begin capturing packets off the wire--or from the air.

It thoroughly examines Lovejoy's contributions to the study of Africa, particularly in exploring issues around production and exchanges at local, regional and international levels. The book offers readers a fresh perspective on the discourse of slavery and colonialism while simultaneously introducing them to the quality of work already accomplished by a stellar scholar.\n\nAs the book argues, Lovejoy presents verifiable historical data that nudges us to reconsider our perception of Africa’s growth trajectory, especially before its encounter with the Americas. A chapter examines the various ways by which the people experienced slavery before it became proliferated during the time Europeans entered into the business. Another chapter addresses questions about the progressive efforts of slave traders to access the interior to drive more victims who would be shipped to the Atlantic for the business of servitude to advance the European economy. Alongside this exploration, a provides the background as to the contributions of Africans to ensure the continuity of this business. Lovejoy notes, for instance, that Muslims were found in every region in the Americas during slavery, which indicates that they were being taken there through transatlantic slavery. While Muslims were found in these areas, it was not true that they were there in large numbers. This is underscored by their resistance to all forms of forced extraction of the people from their homeland. In essence, they challenged the system in ways that redefined their participation in the exercise. The book analyzes how Muslims ensured that economic and political power were withdrawn from the hands of the victims and how they systematically created institutions that promoted that very inequity.\n\nLovejoy’s extensive knowledge allows us to develop theories and establish applicable methodologies for understanding African reality since the precolonial era. He presents original perspectives about addressing issues of African-American engagements and the roles of critical voices in the diaspora. Consequently, the book is an invaluable educational resource, particularly for people who want to deepen their understanding of African social and economic history.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","History"]},{"id":"9781484295533","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Oracle Global Data Services for Mission-critical Systems: Maximizing Performance and Reliability in Complex Enterprise Environments","authors":["Y V Ravi Kumar","Mariami Kupatadze","Sambaiah Sammeta"],"pages":"455","publication_date":"August 2023","description":"New to Oracle Global Data Services?

The secret to this flexibility lies in the software's initialization parameters, whose numerous settings can be configured for top performance in countless environments. On the downside, however, improper settings can slow a system down; even grind it to a halt. And with so many parameters--which change from version to version of Oracle software--it's challenging for Oracle administrators to keep in mind the characteristics and optimal settings for each parameter.The Oracle Initialization Parameters Pocket Reference provides the crucial information you need to make key adjustments to your Oracle database. This concise guide is a mix of invaluable performance tips and a quick reference to Oracle's initialization parameters. The book describes each initialization parameter, indicates what category it's in--from auditing to multi-threaded server MTS--and whether it can be modified dynamically via the ALTER SESSION or ALTER SYSTEM command.In addition to the details about parameter characteristics and settings, you'll find performance tips, such as how the various parameters interact, and what the most advantageous settings are for different configurations. No other reference focuses exclusively on these initialization parameters--an absolute must for anyone working with an Oracle database.Presented in a handy, easy-to-use format, the Oracle Initialization Parameters Pocket Reference is a welcome alternative for anyone who's struggled to memorize the best configuration settings or gone back and forth to online resources, trying to figure out what works.

Seventy-seven percent of leaders think they do a good job of engaging their people, yet 88 percent of employees say their leaders don't engage enough. There is also a high level of suffering in the workplace: 35 percent of employees would forgo a pay raise to see their leaders fired.\n\nThis is an enormous waste of human talent--despite the fact that $46 billion is spent each year on leadership development.\n\nBased on extensive research, including assessments of more than 35,000 leaders and interviews with 250 C-level executives, The Mind of the Leader concludes that organizations and leaders aren't meeting employees' basic human needs of finding meaning, purpose, connection, and genuine happiness in their work.\n\nBut more than a description of the problem, The Mind of the Leader offers a radical, yet practical, solution. To solve the leadership crisis, organizations need to put people at the center of their strategy. They need to develop managers and executives who lead with three core mental qualities: mindfulness, selflessness, and compassion.\n\nUsing real-world inspirational examples from Marriott, Accenture, McKinsey & Company, LinkedIn, and many more, The Mind of the Leader shows how this new kind of leadership turns conventional leadership thinking upside down.

Universally known for his decades of philanthropy, progressive politics, and investment success, he is equally well known as the nemesis of the far right—the target of sustained attacks from nationalists, populists, authoritarian regimes, and anti-Semites—because of his commitment to open society, freedom of the press, and liberal democracy. At age 91, Soros still looms large on the global stage, and yet the man himself is surprisingly little understood. Asking people to describe Soros is likely to elicit different and seemingly contradictory answers. Who is George Soros, really? And why does this question matter?\n\nBiographers have attempted to tell the story of George Soros, but no single account of his life can capture his extraordinary, multifaceted character. Now, in this ambitious and revealing new book, Soros's longtime publisher, Peter L. W. Osnos, has assembled an intriguing set of contributors from a variety of different perspectives—public intellectuals (Eva Hoffman, Michael Ignatieff), journalists (Sebastian Mallaby, Orville Schell), scholars (Leon Botstein, Ivan Krastev), and nonprofit leaders (Gara LaMarche, Darren Walker)—to paint a full picture of the man beyond the media portrayals. Some have worked closely with Soros, while others have wrestled with issues and quandaries similar to his in their own endeavors. Their collective expertise shines a new light on Soros's activities and passions and, to the extent possible, the motivation for them and the outcomes that resulted.\n\nThrough this kaleidoscope of viewpoints emerges a vivid and compelling portrait of this remarkable man's unique and consequential impact.

This monograph offers, possibly for the first time, a systematic historical review as well as a substantive theory of NSAs and their arming efforts.\n\nThe world has been astonished by the ability of the well-armed Hamas to inflict heavy losses on the powerful Israel. Thus, from the Jewish rebellion against Rome to the war between the Ukrainian separatists and the Ukrainian government, NSAs’ weapons acquisition has been vital for the build-up of their force, enabling both the employment of that force and its sustainability. While weapons are not necessarily the most important factor in military build-up, NSAs need weapons to fight, and revolts usually erupt after the organizers have acquired a certain number of weapons. Conversely, many revolts lose momentum and operations are not carried out, or turn ineffective, due to shortages of arms and ammunition.\n\nA major theme of this monograph is that in spite of dramatic political and technological changes, armed NSAs in different periods have employed similar methods to acquire weapons. Self-production, looting and stealing, external support, and the arms trade were always the major ways for NSAs to acquire weapons, though the importance of each method and the type of arms has changed remarkably over time.\n\nUnderstanding Non-State Actors discusses the factors – political, social, cultural, technological, and organizational – that have both facilitated and constrained the ability of NSAs to acquire arms. Especially, lecturers and students of Military, Terrorism, Conflict studies, War and peace studies will benefit from this study.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","Political Science"]},{"id":"9783110559002","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Violence and Legitimacy","authors":["Volker Sellin"],"pages":"346","publication_date":"December 2017","description":"Benjamin Constant distinguished two kinds of government: unlawful government based on violence, and legitimate government based on the general will.

The Grit Factor.\n\nAt age nineteen, Shannon Huffman Polson became the youngest woman ever to climb Denali, the highest mountain in North America. She went on to reach the summits of Mt. Rainier and Mt. Kilimanjaro and spent more than a decade traveling the world. Yet it was during her experience serving as one of the Army's first female attack helicopter pilots, and eventually leading an Apache flight platoon on deployment to Bosnia-Herzegovina, that she learned the lessons of leadership that forever changed her life.\n\nWhere did these insights come from? From her own crucibles of experience—and from other women. In writing The Grit Factor, Polson made it her mission to connect with an elite pack of tough, impressive female iconoclasts who shared with her their candid stories of combat and career. This slate of decorated leaders includes Heather Penney, one of the first female F-16 pilots, who was put on a suicide mission for 9/11; General Ann Dunwoody, the first female four-star general in the Army; Amy McGrath, the first female Marine to fly the F/A-18 in combat and a 2020 candidate for the US Senate—and dozens of other unstoppable women who got there first, including Polson herself.\n\nThese women led at the highest levels in the most complicated, challenging, and male-dominated organization in the world. Now, when positive role models of women leading are needed as never before, Polson brings these voices together, sharing her own life lessons and theirs with storytelling flair, keen insight, and incisive analysis of current research.\n\nWith its gripping narrative and relatable takeaways, The Grit Factor is both inspiring and pragmatic, a book that will energize and enlighten current and aspiring leaders everywhere—whether male or female.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781482226577","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Face Detection and Recognition","authors":["Asit Kumar Datta","Madhura Datta","Pradipta Kumar Banerjee"],"pages":"352","publication_date":"October 2015","description":"This book discusses the major approaches, algorithms, and technologies used in automated face detection and recognition.

But in an institutional system designed for incremental and contested policy-making governance, enacting these transformational ambitions proved to be far more difficult than anticipated.\n\nThis innovative volume assesses the legacy of President Obama, with a conceptual focus on the challenge of meeting his goals with the realities of governing. A diverse group of political science, history, and communication studies experts systematically examines Obama’s performance, accomplishments, and shortcomings through the lens of the expectations gap – the tensions and obstacles of translating campaign promises into policies.\n\nThe wide, representative set of case studies address campaigning and coalition building, party polarization, presidential communication, executive power, leadership and decision-making, and domestic and foreign policy. With original and deep analysis, these scholars make a unique, enduring contribution to understanding the Obama presidency, the office of the president, and indeed American politics. This insightful, accessible book will be of great interest to students and scholars of the presidency, political communication & rhetoric, and broadly across US government and democracy.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","Political Science"]},{"id":"9781000529111","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Sociology and Management Education","authors":["Manish Thakur"],"pages":"126","publication_date":"October 2021","description":"While examining the intersections and engagements between sociology and management education in historical and contemporary terms, this volume outlines the agenda of a promising prospective engagement between the two.

It shifts the focus from if and why marginalized difference should find entry into politics, to the practical question of how this is to be done. What explains those rare moments when marginalized voices break through in contemporary politics? And how might a closer look at the strategies and resources at play within such moments enhance how we understand and enact civic engagement?Political theory and practice have traditionally overlooked the performing arts as a site of civic politics, and yet marginalized communities continually turn to them to communicate, challenge, and catalyze change. This book brings vivid moments of creative practice from three continents together with performance studies and political scholarship to argue that artistic performance offers a potent form of democratic voice for claims from the margins. Across political contexts, democratic aims, and artistic genres, Staging Democracy shows how the very qualities that lead some to think of the arts as unclear, irrational, and irresponsible – and thus politically suspect – shape artistic performance’s distinct capacity to enact democratic engagement in conditions of deep difference and inequality.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","Political Science"]},{"id":"9780071772457","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Ownership Thinking: How to End Entitlement and Create a Culture of Accountability, Purpose, and Profit","authors":["Brad Hams"],"pages":"256","publication_date":"September 2011","description":"It’s an insidious disease that is crippling companies, destroying our economy, and crushing potential. It’s infecting the very roots of business performance, and it’s spreading fast. It isn’t the recession, market volatility, scandal, or greed.\n\nIt’s entitlement. And it may be killing your business.\n\nIn myriad ways, entitlement has been cultivated for decades. As a result, too many employees today believe that they are entitled to a paycheck simply because they show up. Brad Hams has proven that we are not doomed to a path of entitlement and dependence. After more than 15 years working with hundreds of companies, he knows that the vast majority of employees addicted to entitlement actually want to engage, want to contribute, and feel much better about themselves when they are in an environment that requires them to do so.\n\nNow, with Ownership Thinking, Hams shares his strategy that will increase your company’s productivity, employee retention, and profitability:\n\nThe Right Education: Teach employees the fundamentals of business and finance, how their company makes money, and how they add—or take away—value.\nThe Right Measures: Identify the organization’s Key Performance Indicators and teach employees to forecast results in an environment of high visibility and accountability.\nThe Right Incentives: Create incentive plans that are self-funding and clearly align employees’ behavior to the organization’s business and financial objectives.\n\nYour employees will learn to think and act like owners and will become active participants in the financial performance of the business. They will gain the self-esteem that is only possible through achievement and will reap rewards that are in alignment with the success of their organization. Meanwhile, you will enjoy your role more, sleep better at night, and leave a legacy that is far more inspiring and significant than you dreamed possible.\n\nPraise for Ownership Thinking\n\n“You would have to read a dozen other books to even come close to Ownership Thinking—a systematic and practical process for getting your employees to give that extra effort and brain power we know they possess.”—Verne Harnish, CEO, Gazelles; author, Mastering the Rockefeller Habits\n\n“Brad Hams tells it like it truly is: transparency creates trust; trust creates engagement; engagement creates a healthy enterprise.

Provincializing Euro-American queer history, it illustrates how a history of concepts which encompasses the visual offers a greater depth of analysis of the transfer of ideas across regions than texts alone would offer. It also underlines how gay and lesbian history needs to be reframed under a queer lens and understood in a global perspective. Following the journey of the Pink Triangle and its many iterations, A Badge of Injury pinpoints the roles of cultural memory and power in the creation of gay and lesbian transregional narratives of pride or the construction of the historical queer subject.

Too many companies are managed not by leaders but by mere role players and faceless bureaucrats. What would it take to replace these empty suits with real leaders--men and women who are confident in who they are and what they stand for and who truly inspire people to achieve extraordinary results? Rob Goffee and Gareth Jones argue that leaders don't become great by aspiring to a list of universal character traits. Rather, effective leaders are authentic: they deploy individual strengths to engage followers' hearts, minds, and souls. Authentic leaders are skillful at consistently being themselves, even as they alter their behavior to respond effectively to changing contexts. In short, the authors present a powerful case: that it takes \"being yourself, in context, with skill\" to be a successful, authentic leader--and they show you how to do exactly that. In this lively and practical book, Goffee and Jones draw from extensive research to reveal how to hone and deploy your unique leadership assets while managing the inherent tensions at the heart of successful leadership: when to show emotion and when to withhold it, how to get close to followers while maintaining an appropriate role distance, and maintaining your individuality while \"conforming enough\" to gain traction and lead change. Underscoring the inherently social nature of leadership, the book also explores how leaders can stay attuned to the needs and expectations of followers.

Despite its theories and concepts being widely criticized and often proven wrong, it remains part of our culture, academia, and legal systems. Instead of hoping for the field of psychology to one day solve the problem of antisemitism and how to punish it, we must ask ourselves how much it has not helped but rather harmed the fight against it. Through exploring social, clinical, and forensic psychology, as well as psychohistory and the intrusion of psychology into criminal law and policymaking, The Therapized Antisemite argues that we don’t yet understand what causes antisemitism in psychological terms, let alone how to go about solving the problem.

This book argues that analysing India’s foreign and security policies as representational practices which produce India’s identity as a postcolonial nation-state helps to illuminate the conditions of possibility in which foreign policy is made.\n\nSpanning the period between 1947 and 2004, the book focuses on key moments of crisis, such as the India-China war in 1962 and the nuclear tests of 1972 and 1998, and the approach to international affairs of significant leaders like Jawaharlal Nehru. The analysis sheds new light on these key events and figures and develops a strong analytical narrative around India’s foreign policy behaviour, based on an understanding of its postcolonial identity.\n\nIt is argued that a prominent facet of India’s identity is a perception that it is a civilizational-state which brings to international affairs a tradition of morality and ethical conduct derived from its civilizational heritage and the experience of its anti-colonial struggle. This notion of ‘civilizational exceptionalism’, as well as other narratives of India’s civilizational past, such as its vulnerability to invasion and conquest, have shaped the foreign policies of governments of various political hues and continue to influence a rising India.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences"]},{"id":"9781422163733","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Leading People","authors":["Harvard Business Review"],"pages":"112","publication_date":"November 2006","description":"Today’s leaders don’t use command-and-control.

In telling this story, the book highlights the critical features that have set America apart from other countries and identifies the key attributes necessary for it to maintain leadership for years to come.\n\nEntrepreneurship is a rebellious act, and America's democratic system is unique in enabling new companies to challenge established ones. As a result, the country enjoys not just more robust start-up activity, but also a dynamism that forces big companies to improve—or face the consequences. It protects both property rights and the right to compete in ways not enjoyed elsewhere, encouraging investment and innovation. Aside from assessing how American entrepreneurial capitalism unfolded, the authors address current challenges such as the rise of the \"Big Tech\", concerns about inequality, inclusivity and sustainability, and the evolution toward stakeholder capitalism. They compare the American approach to both Continental Europe's consensus-oriented framework and China's authoritarian model.\n\nLaunchpad Republic offers readers:\n\nInsights into how America's political, legal and cultural history helped make the country the most dynamic economy in the world since inception\nA framework for understanding how the country's balanced and limited government, decentralized financial and corporate system, and responsiveness to consumers all served to enable innovation and improved standard of living while avoiding many of the pitfalls of cronyism and protectionism\nFascinating comparisons between the United States and other countries, both historical and contemporary, that provide important context to many of today's critical issues\n\nA book that covers important topics in an easy to read style, Launchpad Republic belongs in the library of every policy wonk, capitalist, entrepreneur, founder, business leader, amateur historian, and technologist with an interest in how America's relentless entrepreneurial spirit has influenced—and will influence—its destiny.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","Political Science"]},{"id":"9781952538551","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"A Time of Change in Hospitality Leadership","authors":["Chris Sheppardson","Iwona Drozdz"],"pages":"274","publication_date":"October 2020","description":"This book is an introduction to the challenge of modern leadership.\n\nLeadership has changed from the traditional perspective to be one which is far broader based, with more expected and asked.

The result is increasing destruction of the natural world and growing, sometimes lethal, tension between rich and poor, global north and south. Trying to fix problems piecemeal is not the solution. We need a comprehensive new vision of an economy that can serve people and all of life's commonwealth. Peter G. Brown and Geoffrey Garver use the core Quaker principle of “right relationship”—interacting in a way that is respectful to all and that aids the common good—as the foundation for a new economic model. Right Relationship poses five basic questions: What is an economy for? How does it work? How big is too big? What's fair? And how can it best be governed? Brown and Garver expose the antiquated, shortsighted, and downright dangerous assumptions that underlie our current answers to these questions, as well as the shortcomings of many current reform efforts. They propose new answers that combine an acute awareness of ecological limits with a fundamental focus on fairness and a concern with the spiritual, as well as material, well-being of the human race. Brown and Garver describe new forms of global governance that will be needed to get and keep the economy in right relationship. Individual citizens can and must play a part in bringing this relationship with life and the world into being.Ultimately the economy, as indeed life itself, is a series of interconnected relationships. An economy based on the idea of “right relationship” offers not only the promise of a bountiful future but also an opportunity to touch the fullness of human meaning and, some would say, the presence of the Divine.","tags":["Other","Politics & Global Issues"]},{"id":"9780131388550","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Knicks Don’t Click: Isiah Thomas Illustrates How Money Can’t Buy You Love","authors":["David J.

Ghosn spent two decades building a colossal partnership between Nissan and Renault that looked like a new model for a global business, but the alliance's shiny image fronted an unsteady, tense operation. Culture clashes, infighting among executives and engineers, dueling corporate traditions, and government maneuvering constantly threatened the venture.\n\nJournalists Hans Greimel and William Sposato have followed the story up close, with access to key players, including Ghosn himself. Veteran Tokyo-based reporters, they have witnessed the end of Japan's bubble economy and attempts at opening Japan Inc. to the world. They've seen the fraying of keiretsu, Japan's traditional skein of business relationships, and covered numerous corporate scandals, of which the Ghosn Shock and Ghosn's subsequent escape stand above all.\n\nExpertly reported, Collision Course explores the complex suspicions around what and who was really responsible for Ghosn's ouster and why one of the top executives in the world would risk everything to escape the country. It explains how economics, history, national interests, cultural politics, and hubris collided, crumpling the legacy of arguably the most important foreign businessman ever to set foot in Japan.\n\nThis gripping, unforgettable narrative, full of fascinating characters, serves as part cautionary tale, part object lesson, and part forewarning of the increasing complexity of doing global business in a nationalistic world.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","History"]},{"id":"9783110684254","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Unwanted Europeanness?","authors":["Branislav Radeljić"],"pages":"312","publication_date":"January 2021","description":"Can we be optimistic about the future of Europe?

Yet history proves that a new generation of success stories will likely emerge from this era of financial chaos. And this new book prepares you to be one of those success stories by analyzing the inner qualities that have propelled the forward-thinking leaders of our time: drive, determination, and self-awareness.\n\nAs strategists for the internationally renowned consumer and political research firm Penn, Schoen & Berland Associates, Michael Berland and Douglas Schoen are experts in how successful people think . . . and how they win. Now they share what they've learned with firsthand accounts from some of the world's most successful people in nearly every field—including the founder of Starwood Resorts; a world-famous chef-restaurateur; the CEO of NBC Universal; a supermodel turned entrepreneur; the head of Estée Lauder; the commissioner of the National Hockey League; the president of Hearst Magazines; and the creator of CBS's 60 Minutes. Berland and Schoen have discovered that true success is about more than \"winning.\" True success has an emotional quotient: it's about determining your innate strengths, deciding what you truly want, and striving tirelessly to achieve it.\n\nBerland and Schoen describe the five archteypes of success: visionaries, natural-born leaders, do-gooders, independence seekers, and independents who follow their dreams. In this unprecedented collection of stories from some of the most successful people in fashion, sports, entertainment, and business, Schoen and Berland demonstrate that success isn't about changing who you are; rather, it's about figuring out what makes you tick—and leveraging that knowledge to your advantage. This book shows through compelling first-person storytelling that the most successful people understand their own natural abilities and how to use their best qualities to create a fulfilling life—and then tells you how to do the same.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"0130087580","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Leverage Competencies: What Financial Executives Need to Lead","authors":["Frederick C.

Two people can have identical experiences, but one blossoms while the other is depleted. The same can be said for any pair of fired CEOs, unsuccessful political candidates, or rookie supervisors. In Crucibles of Leadership, Robert J. Thomas concludes that what matters most is what one makes of experience, particularly the traumatic and often unplanned crucible events that challenge one's identity as a leader. What distinguishes leaders who grow through a crucible experience? Their approach to learning. Like accomplished athletes or artists, they practice as strenuously as they perform. And because the line between performance and practice is often hard to discern, they learn how to practice while they perform.But theirs is no ordinary practice. It's a regimen tailored to individual aspirations, motivations, and learning styles--a Personal Learning Strategy. Building on insightful and moving stories told by accomplished leaders, Thomas offers probing self-assessments and innovative tools designed to help you develop your own Personal Learning Strategy.Provocative and original, with examples drawn from business and politics as well as from the inner workings of the Mormon Church and the Hell's Angels, Thomas's book will revolutionize the way you think about leadership and learning.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781119223238","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The New Leader's 100-Day Action Plan","authors":["George B.

Considering jouge kankei as a social institution and adopting a discourse analytic approach, this volume examines the ways in which institutional jouge kankei as an enduring feature of Japanese social life are created and reproduced. The monograph analyses how seniority-based relations are enacted, legitimised, transmitted, and reified by social actors through language use and paralinguistic discursive practices, such as the use of space, objects, signs, and symbols. It also looks at how established rules could be challenged. The empirical data on which findings are based are gathered through 10 months of ethnographic fieldwork from 2015 to 2018 in Japanese schools, with certain types of data (school club etiquette books and uniforms) being presented and analysed for the first time.

One of her colleagues had just been promoted and, although the guy who got it was good, she didn't think he was any better than her. Well, except at one thing, he was always playing politics - sucking up to the more senior guys and volunteering to be on any committee going.\n\nDebra knew the type - went to the same school, belonged to the same club - she didn't have a hope against the kind of connections he had so she might as well give up. It seemed doing a good job just wasn't enough around here.\n\nDebra and Johann work in an environment with multiple and complex reporting lines - in other words, a matrix. There's room to \"slip between the cracks\" - if a person wants to take advantage of confusion over who is managing performance; or if they can't make the necessary transition to self-management. Communication can be difficult even when there is an apparently shared language.\n\nRead how Johann and Debra work together to identify the skills needed to succeed in a matrix, and how using Emotional Intelligence (EI) can develop specific behaviours you can incorporate in your daily job. The result will help reduce stress and increase your chances of success.\n\nDawn Metcalfe, Managing Director of PDS, based in Dubai, uses her experience as a coach and trainer to give us a behind the curtain look at how mentoring can help an individual develop the skills they need to survive and thrive in today's complex work environments.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781351762267","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"History in Management and Organization Studies","authors":["Behlül Üsdiken","Matthias Kipping"],"pages":"326","publication_date":"October 2020","description":"History in Management and Organization Studies: From Margins to Mainstream is unique in presenting a comprehensive and integrated view of how history has informed management research with a focus on organization theory and strategy.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","History"]},{"id":"9781647820350","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"HBR Working Parents Series Collection (3 Books) (HBR Working Parents Series)","authors":["Harvard Business Review","Daisy Dowling","Stewart D.

The focus of this work is on the pivotal role of British diplomacy in Europe during a period marked by the outbreak of the July Revolution, the dissolution of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, the November Uprising, significant events in the German Confederation and the Papal States, as well as the civil wars in Portugal and Spain, and the two Egyptian-Ottoman wars. The clash between Palmerston and Metternich stands out. Both men were at the forefront of European foreign relations and were symbols of two different political currents. This work aims to challenge the ‘traditional’ view of Palmerston as a progressive statesman who defended the freedom of European liberalism and Metternich as a reactionary who opposed social modernization. The text highlights the motives behind British foreign policy, which were centred on promoting national interests, often at the expense of cooperation among the Great Powers, in contrast to the Austrian Chancellor’s efforts to foster the best possible relations within the Concert of Europe.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","History"]},{"id":"9781953946331","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Learning That CLICS","authors":["Mary Slaughter","Jon Thompson","Janet Ahn"],"pages":"168","publication_date":"June 2022","description":"Make Learning Stick Through Deeper Analysis\n\nAchieving lasting learning starts with understanding our psychology—how we process, retain, and apply learning in our everyday work.

These perplexing, recurring issues are familiar to anyone in a leadership role today, including:\n\nHow do I balance my functional or business unit goals with the needs of my peers and the whole company?\n\nHow do I support and promote others while still advancing my own career?\n\nHow do I emphasize teamwork and still reward the \"stars\"?\n\nCan I really devote enough time and energy to both family and work?\n\nThese are not \"problems\" but paradoxes—situations in which there will never be a single correct solution—and while they make many leaders feel overwhelmed and challenged, this remarkable book provides help. The Unfinished Leader is a modern handbook for recognizing, facing, and inspiring others to expose the real issues that underlie paradoxes in modern organizations. Leaders must first recognize situations they will never be able to \"solve\" and understand how to confront the barriers—in their own heads and their organizations—that push them towards seeking ultimate solutions that don't exist. Leading through complexity requires giving up the illusion of control, consistency, and closure, while embracing the reality of being permanently \"unfinished.\"\n\nDrawing from interviews with 100 CEOs and top leaders from a wide range of companies—such as Avon, Nike, Colgate, DeutschePost DHL, Johnson &amp; Johnson, PepsiCo, and many more—The Unfinished Leader provides the mindsets and tools to recognize contradictory requirements, understand competing demands, and still be able to take action. No one can find or even should look for perfect solutions to impossible situations. The Unfinished Leader will help leaders at all levels understand and excel at their true task: guiding themselves and their teams through ongoing paradoxes, reconciling competing outcomes, continually changing and adapting, and thereby building lasting success.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781948198677","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Leading and Managing Strategic Suppliers","authors":["Richard Moxham"],"pages":"226","publication_date":"May 2019","description":"This book provides practical guidance on the knowledge and skills required for managers whose role involves the management of the relationship with and the performance of strategically important suppliers.\n\nStrategic suppliers provide critical products and services to their clients.

With strong leadership and a richly stocked pool of future leaders, organizations prosper and endure. There is an easy case to make for the imperative of investing in tomorrow's leaders today. It's the law of supply and demand: more organizations in greater competition under increased pressure to perform put a premium on scarce talent. The labor economy has become a seller's market, and poaching or luring talent away from other organizations is a losing proposition. The alternative is to become good at developing your talented managers into great leaders and aggressively seeking out potential and developing it anywhere and everywhere you can find it across the organization. The purpose of this volume is to share what has been learned in the last few years of increased attention to the systematic and strategic cultivation of leadership talent. The time is ripe for leading practitioners to share key lessons about building and filling a leadership pipeline.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9780415259507","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Language, Identity and Conflict","authors":["Diarmait Mac Giolla Chríost"],"pages":"256","publication_date":"March 2004","description":"This innovative study of language and identity in recent and contemporary cases of ethnic conflict in Europe and Eurasia sets out a response to the limitations in the fields of linguistics and political science.

Developing clean technologies is no longer a social issue championed by environmentalists; it's a moneymaking enterprise moving solidly into the business mainstream. In fact, as the economy faces unprecedented challenges from high energy prices, resource shortages, and global environmental and security threats, clean tech—technologies designed to provide superior performance at a lower cost while creating significantly less waste than conventional offerings—promises to be the next engine of economic growth.\n\nIn The Clean Tech Revolution, authors Ron Pernick and Clint Wilder identify the major forces that have pushed clean tech from back-to-the-earth utopian dream to its current revolution among the inner circles of corporate boardrooms, on Wall Street trading floors, and in government offices around the globe. By highlighting eight major clean-tech sectors—solar energy, wind power, biofuels and biomaterials, green buildings, personal transportation, the smart grid, mobile applications, and water filtration—they uncover how investors, entrepreneurs, and individuals can profit from this next wave of technological innovation. Pernick and Wilder shine the spotlight on the winners among technologies, companies, and regions that are likely to reap the greatest benefits from clean tech—and they show you why the time to act is now.\n\nGroundbreaking and authoritative, The Clean Tech Revolution is the must-read book to understand and profit from the clean technologies that are reshaping our fast-changing world.","tags":["Other"]},{"id":"9780714612263","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"The National Debt","authors":["Eric L.

This unequal greying is setting in motion a new social dynamic, idenitified by the author as \"grey dynamic\". Slender families, the breakdown of marriages, children with no siblings or cousins, and vanishing multi-generational homes are all symptoms of the future grey world. The Ageing World is an exploration of this complex new world ahead. In this fast changing world, the long-living individuals will have to live effectively, and this effective living will become a social compulsion. The shrinking workforce won't have the strength to carry the burden of the elderly population--one and half billion by mid-century. The overall effect of the new demography will depend on what people make of their later life. This volume is an exploration of the burgeoning new world we all will face.

How can something so essential be practiced so little in real life?\n\nVision may sound like a rare quality, unattainable by all except a select few—but nothing could be further from the truth. Anyone can expand their visionary capacity. You just need to learn how. In Anticipate, strategy and leadership expert Rob-Jan de Jong explains that to develop vision you must sharpen two key skills. The first is the ability to see things early—spotting the first hints of change on the horizon. The second is the power to connect the dots—turning those clues into a gripping story about the future of your organization and industry.\n\nPacked with stories and practices, Anticipate provides proven techniques for looking ahead and exploring many plausible futures—including the author’s trademarked FuturePriming process, which helps distinguish signal from noise. You will discover how to:\n\nTap into your imagination and open yourself to the unconventional • Become better at seeing things early • Frame the big-picture view that provides direction for the future • Communicate your vision in a way that engages others and provokes action • And more\n\nWhen you anticipate change before your competitors, you create enormous strategic advantage.

The result is a pre-revolutionary situation and a shifting political landscape of overthrows, constant mass protests and mass repression.

Current automatic systems perform well on classifying the subjective or objective character of a document. However, classifications obtained from polarity analysis remain inconclusive, due to the algorithms' inability to understand the subtleties of human language. Automatic Detection of Irony presents, in three stages, a supervised learning approach to predicting whether a tweet is ironic or not. The book begins by analyzing some everyday examples of irony and presenting a reference corpus. It then develops an automatic irony detection model for French tweets that exploits semantic traits and extralinguistic context. Finally, it presents a study of portability in a multilingual framework (Italian, English, Arabic).","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","Linguistics"]},{"id":"9788131730812","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Classes, Citizenship and Inequality","authors":["T.

Five years after its first publication, this book's ideas are no longer \"theory\": they are proven, profitable reality. In the 5th Anniversary Edition, Prahalad thoroughly updates his book to reveal all that's been learned about competing and profiting \"at the bottom of the pyramid.\" Prahalad outlines the latest strategies and tactics that companies are utilizing to succeed in the developing world. He interviews several innovative CEOs to discuss what they've learned from their own initiatives, including the Unilever business leader who's built a billion-dollar business in India. You'll find a new case study on Jaipur Rugs' innovative new global supply chain; updates to earlier editions' key cases; and up-to-the-minute information on the evolution of key industries such as wireless, agribusiness, healthcare, consumer goods, and finance. Prahalad also offers an up-to-date assessment of the key questions his ideas raised: Is there truly a market? Is there scale? Is there profit? Is there innovation? Is this a global opportunity? Five years ago, executives could be hopeful that the answers to these questions would be positive.

They make things too complex. They clutter it with jargon and confusion. They pancake new initiatives on top of old ones. They dither on the launch pad. They chase too many fads. And they fail to make it “safe” for leaders to lead the transformation at their own level. In short, they don’t have a reliable corporate transformation game plan.\n\nWhatever your corporate transformation challenge, whatever your role, Robert H. Miles and Michael T. Kanazawa introduce a simple, proven, results-driven approach that has underpinned some of the most successful corporate transformations of our time. Drawing on their experience as principal process architects working with dozens of CEOs and executive teams, and hundreds of senior executives and staff professionals, they show you how to develop a compelling and potent corporate transformation game plan that enables you to align your organization behind just a few core initiatives; bias your people toward speed; create leaders at every level; integrate in new “disruptive” tools to accelerate progress; and achieve traction and accountability in all phases of execution.\n\nWhether you’re a new CEO taking charge to transform your company, an executive redirecting a major business or function, or one of the hundreds of managers and thousands of employees trying to make sense of a transformation and contribute to it, this book will help you decipher the complexity, find your place on the transformation roadmap, and ensure that the effort rapidly reaches its intended breakthrough results.\n\nA PROVEN, STEP-BY-STEP ROADMAP FOR TRANSFORMATION LEADERS – FAST, SIMPLE, AND COMPRESSED\n\nCorporate transformation and breakthrough performance without the confusion and complexity\n\nGEARED TO RAPIDLY ENGAGE THE FULL ORGANIZATION\n\nTo equip leaders at all levels to lead your transformation in an aligned and engaging manner\n\nFOCUSES EVERYONE ON “DOING MORE ONLESS”\n\nGenerates focused execution and avoid layering initiative upon initiative to conquer organizational gridlock\n\nDESIGNED TO “DISRUPT” HOW TRADITIONAL TRANSFORMATION PROGRAMS ARE DONE\n\nIntroduces disruptive transformation competencies that drive innovation, growth, and a new way of activating change\n\nCorporate transformation is tough work, but extraordinarily rewarding for all involved when led successfully. Somebody’s got to do it, and do it well. What if that someone happens to be you? Where will you start? How will you frame your transformation game plan and lay out its roadmap? What will you do first, and who will you engage when in the enterprise? How will you keep it alive after the early excitement? And how will you make it part of your management process so that it can become a reliable core competency for rising to the increasing rate of disruptive transformation challenges facing your company?\n\nNow there’s a breakthrough methodology to enable CEOs and executive leaders to rise to these corporate transformation challenges.\n\nIn this new edition of BIG Ideas to BIG Results, Robert H.

Filled with case studies of companies such as Bank of America, Johnson & Johnson, Novartis, and UBS, Head, Heart, and Guts, lays out specific steps and actions for leaders who want to grow beyond their \"leadership comfort zone\" and an action plan for companies that want to move beyond tried-and-true leadership development in order to develop \"whole\" leaders throughout their leadership pipeline.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9783110694314","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Iranian and Minority Languages at Home and in Diaspora","authors":["Anousha Sedighi"],"pages":"421","publication_date":"April 2023","description":"While the typology, syntax, and morphology of Iranian languages have been widely explored, the sociolinguistic aspects remain largely understudied. The present companion addresses this essential yet overlooked area of research in two ways: (i) The book explores multilingualism within Iran and its neighbouring countries. (ii) It also investigates Iranian heritage languages within the diasporic context of the West.\n\nThe scope of languages covered is vast: In addition to discussing Iranian minority languages such as Tati and Balochi, the book explores non-Iranian minority languages such as Azeri, Tukmen, Armenian and Mandaic. Furthermore, the companion investigates Iranian heritage languages such as Wakhi, Pashto, and Persian within their diasporic and global contexts.\n\nIn the current era of migration and globalization, minority and heritage speakers are increasingly valuable resources. By focusing on the speakers, the companion provides new insights into a multitude of sociolinguistic issues including language attitude and identity, language use and literacy practices, language policy, language shift and loss.\n\nThe companion is an essential reference for those interested in Iranian languages, minority languages, heritage languages, sociolinguistics, bilingualism, language policy and planning, diaspora and migration studies, as well as those researching in related fields.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","Political Science"]},{"id":"01520110002SI","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Issues & Observations: Reflections on Leadership in Troubled Waters","authors":["Craig Chappelow"],"pages":"3","publication_date":"January 2001","description":"How do you deal with a crisis?

Some see it as the foundation of political and economic freedom. For others it was economics gone wrong, and ended in \"Russians stealing money from their own country\". As Russia reasserts itself, and its new brand of capitalism, it is ever more important that policy makers and scholars understand the roots of the economic structure and governance of that country; what was decided, who made the decisions and why, what actually transpired, and what implications this has for the future of Russia.\n\nThis work, written by two senior advisors to the Russian government, has unique access to documentation, tracking the decision making process in the Russian Mass Privatization process. By close reference to events, and supplemented by interviews with many of the key participants, it shows that the policies adopted were often influenced and shaped by different forces than those cited by current popular accounts. The book challenges the interpretation of Russian privatization by some of the West’s most eminent economists. It underlines that economists of all schools, who bring assumptions from the West to the analysis of Russia, may reach false or misleading conclusions. It is an essential guide for anyone interested in Russian economic reform, and anyone who seeks to understand this enigmatic country, and its actions today.","tags":["Other","Politics & Global Issues"]},{"id":"9783110744866","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Applying Linguistics in Health Research, Education, and Policy","authors":["Brett A.

But why do people follow? Books abound on leaders, but much less is known about followers. In The Leaders We Need, Maccoby steps into this yawning gap in the literature.This insightful book shows that followers have their own powerful motivations to follow. Many relate to their leader as to some important person from the pasta parent, a sibling, a close friend. With major shifts in family structure and other social changes (especially transformations in technology and work life), these transferences” have grown complexmaking leaders’ work more challenging.The key for modern-day leaders? Being sensitive to how a group’s collective psychology and social context shape its leadership needs. For example, factory workers in a large city during a period of relative calm would need very different leaders than people working in a star management consultancy during a time of stiffening competition. The author outlines the profound shift from a more bureaucratic society and leadership model to an interactive, collaborative oneand provides crucial advice on how to become a leader we need.”Offering provocative psychological insight and thoughtful analysis of social and cultural changes, this book examines leadership through an entirely new lens.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781579582494","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Encyclopedia of Radio 3-Volume Set","authors":["Christopher H.

The destruction on 9/11 of two of the world's largest buildings unleashed a vortex of dust and ash that blotted out the sun and has distorted science, medicine and public policy ever since. The likely dangers of 9/11's massive dust cloud were evident from the beginning, yet thousands chose not to see. Why? As the sickening results of exposure became evident, many still refused to recognize them. Why? The consequences are still being tallied in the wasted bodies and disrupted lives of thousands who gave their all when the need was greatest, but whose demands for justice have been consumed by years of politics and courtroom maneuvers. Why?, separating reality from myth - and doing so with exceptional literary style and grace. DePalma covered Ground Zero for The New York Times for four years. DePalma introduces heroic firefighters, dedicated doctors and scientists, obsessive city officials, partisan politicians, aggressive lawyers, and compassionate judges and reveals the individual decisions that destroyed public trust, and the desperate attempts made to rebuild it. The dust that was the World Trade Center has changed everything it touched. This is the story of that dust, the 9/11 disaster after the disaster, and what it tells us about ourselves and our future.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","History"]},{"id":"01520110004SI","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"The Third Way: A New Source of Leadership","authors":["Wilfred H.

But Harrison wasn’t content to uphold that reputation; he knew it could be even better. As an IRONMAN triathlete, he had a drive to push boundaries; as a two-time cancer survivor, he had a deeper empathy for patients and a greater sense of urgency. Harrison led an ambitious transformation that has unleashed Intermountain’s workforce not only to improve the organization but to look beyond it and tackle a range of problems that have plagued both the industry and our broader society. Bucking the prevailing culture of conflict and polarization, leaders at all levels are empowered to convene diverse stakeholders in unorthodox ways to solve problems that affect everyone.\n\nIn Possibility Unleashed, you’ll learn what happens when you:\n\nWalk in others’ shoes\nEmbrace an outsider’s perspective\nLook in the mirror\nFix what isn’t broken . . . yet\nUnlock the genius at the bedside (or at the front line)\nAsk “What if?”\nMake “frenemies”\nGo upstream\nStand up for what’s right\nColor outside the (red and blue) lines\n\nYou’ll find real-life examples of how this works in action—from a liberal, Harvard-trained program manager partnering with a leading gun rights advocate to address the issue of firearm-assisted suicides to a healthcare organization fighting high prices and drug shortages by working with its competitors to establish a not-for-profit generic drug company that benefits all. And while other health systems stand by as their communities struggle with poverty, crime, and other seemingly nonmedical issues, Intermountain is investing millions to address them, recognizing that they in turn profoundly affect people’s health. It’s a radical approach to leadership that shuns the status quo to create lasting transformative change. In Possibility Unleashed, you’ll discover the blueprint to making a far greater impact on society than you’d imagined while also building strong, financially healthy organizations where people love to work.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"01520110054SI","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Leading Roles: What Coaches of Women Need to Know","authors":["Marian N.

It has become the second largest market for Fortune 500 companies like Starbucks, Apple, and Nike and drives growth for Hollywood and commodity products.

Step by step, the expert helps him understand why his past and present efforts have fallen short and exactly what he needs to do to create an empowered workforce. The process as it unfolds is complex, paradoxical and counterintuitive -but well worth the effort.The new introduction dispels the notion that empowerment is a bygone fad. No matter what its name, the essential concept-that organizations can achieve extraordinary results by recognizing and taking advantage of the skills, experience, and knowledge already existing in the organization-will always be relevant.The new epilogue describes obstacles companies have encountered and overcome and outlines empowerment strategies that have proved successful during the fifteen years the authors have been consulting, researching, and refining these concepts.Although sometimes arduous, the journey to empowerment is well worth making. In fact, unleashing the power of people in an organization may be the only way to continue to do business in a competitive, complicated marketplace.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9783111070780","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Contested Civic Spaces","authors":["Siri Hummel","Rupert Strachwitz"],"pages":"344","publication_date":"July 2023","description":"For some years, we have observed a broad public discussion over the shrinking civic space.

Debates over globalization, climate change, health care, and poverty will not be “solved” with simple answers, but that's what Americans are being trained to expect. Andrea Batista Schlesinger argues that we're besieged by cultural forces that urge us to avoid critical thinking and independent analysis. The media reduces politics to a spectator sport, standardized tests teach students to fill in the dots instead of opening their minds, and even the Internet promotes habits that discourage looking deeper.  But the situation isn't hopeless. Schlesinger profiles individuals and institutions renewing the practice of inquiry—particularly in America's youth—at a time when our society demands such activity from us all.

We need look no further than events on the world stage to see the heat signature of this – from the arrival of Wikileaks, the Arab Spring of 2011 and the Occupy movements, to the social media revolution and flashpoints such as the British Members of Parliament expenses scandal. All are examples of deep change occurring.\n\nThis book is about what this means for the workplace and for management. The proposition offered here is that our organisations need to catch up, and that the \"death of deference\" that we are seeing elsewhere in society needs to be accelerated in the workplace.\n\nSystems of deference slow down organisational performance. Deference prevents organisations from learning. It stops them from being agile, innovative and ethical. Deference is the enemy of organisational success and it needs to be dismantled so that in its place we can build modern organisations with a new breed of managers and leaders. This book offers a solution to a problem that belongs in the last century, and a game plan for nothing short of a workplace revolution.\n\n\"If deference is dead, this book is about the resurrection of the effective manager in a world where nothing is quite the way it used to be. Powerful and thought-provoking from start to finish.\"\n\n- Jeremy Vine, BBC Presenter and Author\n\n\"Never Mind the Bosses is a refreshing type of management book, it advocates that deference to authority figures needs to go if we are to have engaged workforces.\"\n\n- Cary L.

But we all know, this is not a just a problem for the elite. The broad-based reaction to this chaotic, unmanageable assault has been to retrench, and to focus on immediate, controllable decisions. In the process, we lose sight of the horizon. More dangerous still, is the shift we've seen from value creation to wealth creation, where information technology 1.0 has enabled a transaction-based society in which the \"deal\" is more important than the value it drives or the relationships it is based on. On our current path, the odds of a better future are slim.\n\nWhat we need is a new value proposition.\n\nBeating the Global Odds is the answer to the dangers of too much of a good thing.

In a word: heroes. Although such figures are inspiring, their larger-than-life accomplishments are not what makes the world work. Instead, it is the sum of millions of small yet consequential decisions that individuals working far from the limelight make every day. \nBadaracco calls these individuals \"quiet leaders\"-  people who choose responsible, behind-the-scenes action over public heroism to resolve tough leadership challenges. Quiet leaders don't fit the stereotype of the bold and gutsy leader, and they don't want to. What they want is to do the \"right thing\"- for their organizations, their coworkers, and themselves- inconspicuously and without casualties. \nDrawing from extensive research, Harvard Business School professor and author Joseph Badaracco presents eight practical yet counter-intuitive guidelines for situations in which right and wrong seem like moving targets. Compelling stories illustrate how these \"nonheroes\" succeed by managing their political capital, buying themselves time, bending the rules, and more.

Many critical thinkers have defined this post-2008 crisis phase as a fascist moment of neoliberalism since far-Right movements and parties are not only enhancing their political representation but also setting the agenda of today’s politics. However, such a crucial political moment needs more precise analytical tools.\n\nIn this framework, Neoliberalism Reloaded: Authoritarian Governmentality and the Rise of the Radical Right seeks to understand the emergence of the New Right and punitive neoliberalism not only as a reaction to a crisis of accumulation but also as an outcome of neoliberal reason and the historical neoliberal alliance with conservative and reactionary political forces. Therefore, far from thinking this moment as exceptional, this book seeks the roots of today’s punitive neoliberalism in its theoretical framework and in the violence inherent to neoliberal capitalism towards those racialized, colonized, genderized and precarized populations that cannot adjust to the norm of competitiveness. Thus, Neoliberalism Reloaded seeks to contribute to understanding the challenges of our present as a necessary step to imagine alternative futures.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","Political Science"]},{"id":"9780071745383","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Oracle CRM On Demand Combined Analyses","authors":["Michael D.

The challenges result from both long-term management problems and the political, social, and economic turmoil of the past few years. The contributors to Which Way Forward? explore recent events in Indonesia, while focusing on what can be done differently to counter the destruction of forests due to asset-stripping, corruption, and the absence of government authority. Contributors to the book include anthropologists, economists, foresters, geographers, human ecologists, and policy analysts. Their concerns include the effects of government policies on people living in forests, the impact of the economic crisis on small farmers, links between corporate debt and the forest sector, and the fires of the late 1990s. By analyzing the nation‘s dramatic circumstances, they hope to demonstrate how Indonesia as well as other developing countries might handle their challenges to protect biodiversity and other resources, meet human needs, and deal with political change.

The book presents the Sri Lankan crisis as an exemplification of a broader global existential crisis facing more and more debt trapped countries, especially in the post-colonial Global South. The book's in-depth case study raises important questions pertaining to sovereignty and political and economic democracy in Sri Lanka and the world at large.\n\nThe book also explores the emergence of the crisis in the context of the accelerating geopolitical conflict between China and the USA in the Indian Ocean. It ponders if the debt crisis, economic collapse and political destabilization in Sri Lanka were intentionally precipitated to the advantage of the Quadrilateral Alliance (USA, India, Australia and Japan).\n\nMoving beyond geopolitical rivalry, the book juxtaposes Sri Lanka’s political-economic crisis with the broader ecological crisis of climate change and sea-level rise.\n\nThe book concludes with a consideration of the ethical dilemmas behind the debt and survival crisis in Sri Lanka and across the world. It points out a range of social movements and initiatives in Sri Lanka and the Global South which subscribe to collective and ecological alternatives and a Middle Path of sustainability and social justice.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","Political Science"]},{"id":"9781633691094","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Why Should Anyone Be Led By You? NEW PREFACE","authors":["Rob Goffee","Gareth Jones"],"pages":"256","publication_date":"November 2015","description":"Are you an authentic leader? Too many companies are managed not by leaders but by mere role players and faceless bureaucrats. What would it take to replace these empty suits with real leaders--men and women who are confident in who they are and what they stand for and who truly inspire people to achieve extraordinary results? Rob Goffee and Gareth Jones argue that leaders don’t become great by aspiring to a list of universal character traits. Rather, effective leaders are authentic: they deploy individual strengths to engage followers’ hearts, minds, and souls. Authentic leaders are skillful at consistently being themselves, even as they alter their behavior to respond effectively to changing contexts. In short, the authors present a powerful case: that it takes “being yourself, in context, with skill” to be a successful, authentic leader--and they show you how to do exactly that. In this lively and practical book, Goffee and Jones draw from extensive research to reveal how to hone and deploy your unique leadership assets while managing the inherent tensions at the heart of successful leadership: when to show emotion and when to withhold it, how to get close to followers while maintaining an appropriate role distance, and maintaining your individuality while “conforming enough” to gain traction and lead change. Underscoring the inherently social nature of leadership, the book also explores how leaders can stay attuned to the needs and expectations of followers. \"Why Should Anyone Be Led by You?\" will forever change how we view, develop, and practice the art of leadership, wherever we live and work.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"0131873385","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"The Truth About Being a Leader...and Nothing But the Truth","authors":["Dr. Karen Otazo"],"pages":"256","publication_date":"November 2006","description":"When it comes to effective leadership, everyone has an opinion.

Yet, over the past several years, a growing number of CEOs have failed early in their terms, often with devastating consequences to their companies and stockholders. By far the most common problem is a lack of ownership of the CEO succession process. Inside CEO Succession provides businesses, leaders, and boards with the strategies they need to execute their responsibilities with a heightened level of professionalism and ensure the sustained success of the companies they serve.\n\nWritten by Dr. Thomas J. Saporito, CEO of RHR International, and Dr. Paul Winum, Senior Partner of RHR International, the lessons of Inside CEO Succession are rooted in RHR's long-standing history of bringing expert knowledge, experience, advice, and counsel to the issues related to CEO succession. The culmination of RHR's 65 years of experience providing expert counsel to the boards of directors of hundreds of companies, it explains how ego, role-relationships, power, and human dynamics associated with relinquishing leadership, preparing successors, and ceding power and authority to other people create undetected problems in the succession process and ultimately cause many CEOs to fail early in their tenures.\n\nDistills RHR's 65 years of experience helping businesses deal with CEO succession into one practical resource\n\nPresents strategies to enable boards to understand their role in succession planning and how to source leadership that best fits their organization's culture and requirements\n\nBrings together business acumen and psychological insight to help readers better prepare for more effective CEO succession\n\nTo be successful, CEO succession requires a well-defined course of action that ensures that a number of highly capable candidates are ready to assume the chief executive position whether through an unexpected event or a planned transition.

The study analyses the interaction between visual and verbal modes, highlighting the multimodal manifestations of the rhetorical devices frequently employed to create humour in English-language cartoons collected from the Saudi media. The multimodal analysis shows that the frequent rhetorical devices such as allusions, parody, metaphor, metonymy, juxtaposition, and exaggeration take a form which is woven between the visual and verbal modes, and which makes the production of humorous and satirical effect more unique and interesting.

Data for the book was sourced from (a) the workshop proceedings of the 6th PRME Asia Forum held in November 2015 and (b) case studies submitted as part of the Forum. Academics from India, China, Philippines, New Zealand, USA and Hong Kong (who taught in Asia) contributed to the workshop / the case studies. The book describes how some Asian business schools are incorporating ethics, social responsibility and sustainability into their curricular and extra-curricular activities. It identifies the challenges faced in providing such education and the implications thereof. In the process, it captures the unique flavour of Asian business schools. Business schools in Asia appear to have introduced several stand-alone courses on ethics and corporate responsibility. They have adopted pedagogies suited to the profile of their students. Many have promoted a concern for the poor through volunteering, projects or internships with NGOs. However, few have made responsible management a central part of their business school curriculum. Greater integration of responsible management into the curriculum requires supportive administrative policies, greater cross-functional interaction and the development of context-appropriate learning materials.","tags":["Other","Education"]},{"id":"9781606498910","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"SPeak Performance","authors":["Jim Walz"],"pages":"174","publication_date":"January 2014","description":"Every leader needs to move people to action andalign everyone’s actions toward the same goal.But how is this best accomplished?

Its purpose is to tackle key injustices and social inequality that are symptoms of the capitalist market system.\n\nBy focusing on an agenda of doing good, temperatism seeks to reduce the level of elitism and social exclusion, that capitalism claims are inevitable, by sharing access to resources and ensuring that all individuals have the opportunity to exercise their talent potential. With the world economy in flux and globalism under pressure from populist politicians finding a new way to think about business and doing good is significant at this point in history. The hurt and pain that inequality inflicts on individuals and groups in society through exclusion and neglect is in conflict with our natural sense of affinity, collaboration and our intrinsic sense of fair play and justice. The dysfunction that we are currently experiencing in our society is as a direct result of the inequality within our society.\n\nTemperatism is based on the idea that humanity has the potential to co-operate, collaborate, assist and contribute to the greater good.  The questions discussed in Volume 2 explore how replacing the profit motive with a doing good motive makes it possible to tackle some of society’s biggest challenges including reducing poverty, improving access to health and education, defending human rights, and protecting the environment.  Organizations with a social conscience will leave a legacy of which they can be rightly proud, shifting business from being the center of society’s problems to being its savior.","tags":["Other","Politics & Global Issues"]},{"id":"9783110735949","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Democratic Turbulence in the United Kingdom","authors":["Andrew Blick"],"pages":"221","publication_date":"November 2023","description":"Numerous analysts have lately expressed concern about tendencies including democratic backsliding and populism occurring in many countries worldwide.

Now, it's no secret that the center of gravity is shifting. The advanced economies that in 2000 consumed 75% of the world's output will, by 2050, consume just 32%. Meanwhile, the emerging economies of the world--Brazil, India, China, and others--will surge forward.As these fast-growing, low-income economies mature, will they adopt the practices of the old guard? Or will they make their own way, and create the next prevailing version of capitalism? What new opportunities will that create for firms around the world?Standing on the Sun tackles these questions with fresh ideas and provocative examples. Based on firsthand observations of companies defying capitalism's old rules yet prospering, the authors outline new principles for commercial success. Among them:· The obsession with return on equity gives way to more broad-based measurements of success.· Adam Smith's invisible hand of the market is redeemed by the \"invisible handshake\" of collaborative networks. · Businesses take ownership of the impacts they now call \"externalities.\"Those who need to understand the emerging shape of global capitalism will benefit from Standing on the Sun.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","Political Science"]},{"id":"9781547400386","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Governance Revolution","authors":["Deborah Hicks Midanek"],"pages":"316","publication_date":"September 2018","description":"Boards of directors are sitting ducks.

She includes a timely discussion of how clarity of purpose can improve board and director effectiveness. Informed by her long experience serving public, private, and family owned corporate boards as well as those of charitable, and government organizations, she provides essential context regarding the evolution of board practice as well as candid discussion of the issues involved in the relentless effort to improve corporate governance processes. Focused mainly on the dominant public corporation, she also explores the special challenges of serving private and family owned as well as nonprofit and public agency boards.\n\nWritten by a seasoned board member, and liberally laced with stories and cases illustrating the tricky issues directors wrestle with, this book is the essential common-sense companion for anyone working with a board, serving on a board, or wanting to do so.

Business—not government alone.\n\nThe spread of capitalism worldwide has made people wealthier than ever before. But capitalism's future is far from assured. Pandemics, income inequality, resource depletion, mass migrations from poor to rich countries, religious fundamentalism, the misuse of social media, and cyberattacks—these are just a few of the threats to continuing prosperity that we see dominating the headlines every day.\n\nHow can capitalism be sustained? And who should spearhead the effort? Critics turn to government. In their groundbreaking book, Capitalism at Risk, Harvard Business School professors Joseph Bower, Herman Leonard, and Lynn Paine argue that while robust governments must play a role, leadership by business is essential. For enterprising companies—whether large multinationals, established regional players, or small startups—the current threats to market capitalism present important opportunities.\n\nIn this updated and expanded edition of Capitalism at Risk, Bower, Leonard, and Paine set forth a renewed and more urgent call to action. With three additional chapters and a new preface, the authors explain how the eleven original disruptors of the global market system clash with the digital age, and they provide lessons on how to take action. Presenting examples of companies already making a difference, Bower, Leonard, and Paine show how business must serve both as innovator and activist—developing corporate strategies that effect change at the community, national, and international levels.\n\nFilled with rich insights, this new edition of Capitalism at Risk presents a compelling and constructive vision for the future of market capitalism.","tags":["Other","Politics & Global Issues"]},{"id":"9781844070183","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The 2030 Spike","authors":["Colin Mason"],"pages":"250","publication_date":"June 2013","description":"The clock is relentlessly ticking!Our world teeters on a knife-edge between a peaceful and prosperous future for all, and a dark winter of death and destruction that threatens to smother the light of civilization.

Ready","Alan Mulally"],"pages":"9","publication_date":"October 2017","description":"The authors argue that it is increasingly important for business leaders to learn how to build companies that are simultaneously purpose-driven, performance-focused, and principles-led. At a time when the pace of change in business is faster than ever, they believe that building organizations with these three characteristics is no longer a choice. Being performance-driven is clearly essential to success; continuous disruption, rapid technological innovation, and turbulence require that today’s leaders build agile organizations with resilient employees in order to achieve superior performance. But focusing on results alone is not enough. Demographic, cultural, and technological changes have led to a workforce that demands a set of operating principles characterized by core values such as transparency, trust, inclusion, and real-time collaboration to help guide behaviors and decision-making in companies. Finally, studies have shown that millennials are deeply motivated by corporate social responsibility and a compelling sense of purpose. Together, these forces make the case that companies that fail to aspire to align purpose, performance, and principles will also fail to attract the best talent. Furthermore, to achieve the kind of transformations that today’s fast-moving economy often requires of businesses, executives need engaged, committed employees who have opportunities to contribute their knowledge. Purpose and principles can help engage employees in support of high performance. The authors acknowledge that while it is easy for executives to say they aspire to build companies that are simultaneously purpose-driven, performance-focused, and principles-led, it is a difficult accomplishment to achieve. There are often inherent tensions and conflicting goals associated with trying to achieve all three aims. How can executives align purpose, performance, and principles so that they can lead their organizations through major changes? The authors’ research and experience suggest the task requires not only a set of leadership skills that they describe but also five mindsets that encompass the embedded tensions that face leaders of large, complex organizations. Executives must learn to reconcile these tensions by mastering a series of five conflicting yet complementary dualities: urgency and patience; collective and individual accountability; coaching and driving performance; student and teacher; and humility and boldness. One of the authors, Alan Mulally, the former CEO of Ford Motor Co., describes the role these dualities played when he led a successful turnaround of that company.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9780787960759","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Five Dysfunctions of a Team: A Leadership Fable","authors":["Patrick M.

Referred to as \"the high prophet of quality\" by the New York Times, Deming was instrumental in the spectacular rise of Japanese industry after World War II and influenced many of the world's most innovative managers in the ensuing decades. His original ideas led directly to the creation of relationships with suppliers and a plethora of quality initiatives.\n\nNow, with The Essential Deming, Fordham University professor and Deming expert Joyce Orsini draws on a wealth of previously unavailable material to present the legendary thinker's most important management principles in one indispensable volume.\n\nThe book is filled with articles, papers, lectures, and notes touching on a wide range of topics, but which focus on Deming's overriding message: quality and operations are all about systems, not individual performance; the system has to be designed so that the worker can perform well.\n\nThe Essential Deming reveals Deming's unique insight about:\n\nHow poor management infects an entire organization\nThe critical importance of management on producing quality products and services\nImproving management in any company\nThe effective management of people--the manager's single most important task\nHow to educate workers into critical thinkers\nWays to preserve statistical integrity while dealing with real-world problems\n\nFully authorized by the Deming estate and published in cooperation with The W.

The text covers new analytic procedures that are valuable for existing properties and enable a new, more profitable perspective on the planning, design, operation, and evaluation of large-scale, multi-phase development projects. The book thereby aims to significantly improve valuation and investment decision making.Flexibility and Real Estate Valuation under Uncertainty: A Practical Guide for Developers is presented at 3 levels. First, it introduces and explains the concepts underlying the approach at a basic level accessible to non-technical and non-specialized readers. Its introductory and concluding chapters present the important “big picture” implications of the analysis for economics and valuation and for project design and investment decision making.At a second level, the book presents a framework, a roadmap for the prospective analyst. It describes the practical tools in detail, taking care to go through the elements of the approach step-by-step for clarity and easy reference.The third level includes more technical details and specific models. An Appendix discusses the technical details of real estate price dynamics. Associated web pages provide electronic spreadsheet templates for the models used as examples in the book. Some features of the book include:•    Concepts and tools that are simple and accessible to a broad audience of practitioners;•    An approach relevant for all development projects;•    Complementarity with the author's Commercial Real Estate Analysis & Investments—the most-cited real estate investments textbook on the market.Flexibility and Real Estate Valuation under Uncertainty: A Practical Guide for Developers is for everyone studying or concerned with the implementation of large-scale or multi-phase real estate development projects, as well as property investment and valuation more generally.","tags":["Other","Real Estate"]},{"id":"53863MIT67228","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"To Reform Meritocracy, Put Character at the Center","authors":["Thomas A.

He shows how, by thinking of your career as a narrative—with a plot, characters, and an arc—you can increase your awareness of yourself as a leader and become more effective, insightful, and inspiring. Using story as both a metaphor and a process for self-development, Tobin offers activities and questions that help you better understand your own leadership and how others perceive it. What is the plot of your leadership story—your overall goals and purpose? Who are the main characters and what roles do they play? How have the settings of your story influenced it? What are the conflicts that you need to resolve to move toward the ending you intend? But you have to share your story to make it an effective leadership tool. Tobin gives detailed advice on framing your message, finding ways to communicate it, and understanding the role others play in furthering that message. If you don't tell your leadership story, other people will—and it may not be the story you want told. Taking control of your leadership story enables you to more consciously shape the impact you have in the world. You'll be better equipped to make decisions, choose actions that tell the story you want to tell, make stronger connections to those you lead, and ensure that you become the kind of leader you want to be.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781394276370","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Contemporary Leader","authors":["Riza Kadilar"],"pages":"250","publication_date":"December 2024","description":"Strategies and tools to become a better leader by developing an inclusive perspective at work\n\nInstead of seeing inclusiveness as a “trendy concept,” The Contemporary Leader: The Value of Inclusion in Successful Leadership shows its audience on how inclusion is an emotion that is achieved only through effective practice abilities.

The book not only provides a clear explanation to four distinct attitudes to religion, but also defends hierarchical forms of religious organization and attempts to retain a balanced judgement between fundamentalism and established religion.

You've picked exactly the right columns, you've got them in the ideal order, you've computed statistics, you've checked for null columns—and the optimizer flatly refuses to use your index unless you hint it. What could possibly be going wrong?\n\nIf you've suffered the frustration of watching the optimizer do something completely bizarre when the best execution plan is totally obvious, or spent hours or days trying to make the optimizer do what you want it to do, then this is the book you need. You'll come to know how the optimizer thinks, understand why it makes mistakes, and recognize the data patterns that make it go awry. With this information at your fingertips, you will save an enormous amount of time on designing and trouble-shooting your SQL.\n\nThe cost-based optimizer is simply a piece of code that contains a model of how Oracle databases work. By applying this model to the statistics about your data, the optimizer tries to efficiently convert your query into an executable plan. Unfortunately, the model can't be perfect, your statistics can't be perfect, and the resulting execution plan may be far from perfect.\n\nIn Cost-Based Oracle Fundamentals, the first book in a series of three, Jonathan Lewis—one of the foremost authorities in this field—describes the most commonly used parts of the model, what the optimizer does with your statistics, and why things go wrong. With this information, you'll be in a position to fix entire problem areas, not just single SQL statements, by adjusting the model or creating more truthful statistics.","tags":["Data","Data Engineering","Oracle Database Solutions"]},{"id":"9781789530797","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Hands-On Data Analysis with NumPy and pandas","authors":["Curtis Miller"],"pages":"168","publication_date":"June 2018","description":"Dive into 'Hands-On Data Analysis with NumPy and pandas' to explore the world of Python for data analysis.

At a time when environmental awareness is of growing relevance, the overriding aim is to understand a history of architecture as a history of weather and thus to consider the weather as an architectural author that affects design, construction and use in a creative dialogue with other authors such as the architect and user.\n\nEnvironmental discussions in architecture tend to focus on the practical or the poetic but here they are considered together. Rather than investigate architecture’s relations to the weather in isolation, they are integrated into a wider discussion of cultural and social influences on architecture. The analysis of weather’s effects on the design and experience of specific buildings and gardens is interwoven with a historical survey of changing attitudes to the weather in the arts, sciences and society, leading to a critical re-evaluation of contemporary responses to climate change.","tags":["Other"]},{"id":"0321413660","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"The Tech-Savvy Real Estate Agent","authors":["Realtor Galen Gruman"],"pages":"256","publication_date":"March 2006","description":"Sure, you know how to use the MLS database, but do you know how to effectively establish a Web presence or do customer outreach via email or the Web?

The dangerous confluence of these factors is driving media narratives, influencing opinions, and possibly changing election results. \nIn this book, algorithmic recommendations, clickbait, familiarity bias, propaganda, and other pivotal concepts are analyzed and then expanded upon via fascinating and timely case studies: the 2016 US presidential election, Ferguson, GamerGate, international political movements, and more events that come to affect every one of us.\n \nWhat are the implications of how we engage with information in the digital age? Data versus Democracy explores this topic and an abundance of related crucial questions. We live in a culture vastly different from any that has come before. In a society where engagement is currency, we are the product. Understanding the value of our attention, how organizations operate based on this concept, and how engagement can be used against our best interests is essential in responsibly equipping ourselves against the perils of disinformation.\nWho This Book Is For\nIndividuals who are curious about how social media algorithms work and how they can be manipulated to influence culture. Social media managers, data scientists, data administrators, and educators will find this book particularly relevant to their work.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","History"]},{"id":"9780789736130","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"How Computers Work, Ninth Edition","authors":["Ron White","Timothy Edward Downs"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"November 2007","description":"Having sold more than 2 million copies over its lifetime, How Computers Work is the definitive illustrated guide to the world of PCs and technology.

Netcat is often referred to as a \"Swiss Army knife\" utility, and for good reason. Just like the multi-function usefullness of the venerable Swiss Army pocket knife, Netcat's functionality is helpful as both a standalone program and a backe-end tool in a wide range of applications. Some of the many uses of Netcat include port scanning, transferring files, grabbing banners, port listening and redirection, and more nefariously, a backdoor. This is the only book dedicated to comprehensive coverage of the tool's many features, and by the end of this book, you'll discover how Netcat can be one of the most valuable tools in your arsenal.* Get Up and Running with Netcat Simple yet powerful...Don't let the trouble-free installation and the easy command line belie the fact that Netcat is indeed a potent and powerful program.* Go PenTesting with Netcat Master Netcat's port scanning and service identification capabilities as well as obtaining Web server application information. Test and verify outbound firewall rules and avoid detection by using antivirus software and the Window Firewall. Also, create a backdoor using Netcat.* Conduct Enumeration and Scanning with Netcat, Nmap, and More! Netcat's not the only game in town...Learn the process of network of enumeration and scanning, and see how Netcat along with other tools such as Nmap and Scanrand can be used to thoroughly identify all of the assets on your network.* Banner Grabbing with Netcat Banner grabbing is a simple yet highly effective method of gathering information about a remote target, and can be performed with relative ease with the Netcat utility.* Explore the Dark Side of Netcat See the various ways Netcat has been used to provide malicious, unauthorized access to their targets. By walking through these methods used to set up backdoor access and circumvent protection mechanisms through the use of Netcat, we can understand how malicious hackers obtain and maintain illegal access. Embrace the dark side of Netcat, so that you may do good deeds later.* Transfer Files Using Netcat The flexability and simple operation allows Netcat to fill a niche when it comes to moving a file or files in a quick and easy fashion. Encryption is provided via several different avenues including integrated support on some of the more modern Netcat variants, tunneling via third-party tools, or operating system integrated IPsec policies.* Troubleshoot Your Network with Netcat Examine remote systems using Netat's scanning ability. Test open ports to see if they really are active and see what protocls are on those ports. Communicate with different applications to determine what problems might exist, and gain insight into how to solve these problems.* Sniff Traffic within a System Use Netcat as a sniffer within a system to collect incoming and outgoing data. Set up Netcat to listen at ports higher than 1023 (the well-known ports), so you can use Netcat even as a normal user.\nComprehensive introduction to the #4 most popular open source security tool available\nTips and tricks on the legitimate uses of Netcat\nDetailed information on its nefarious purposes\nDemystifies security issues surrounding Netcat\nCase studies featuring dozens of ways to use Netcat in daily tasks","tags":["IT Operations","Monitoring","Packet Analysis","Wireshark"]},{"id":"9781849680684","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Getting Started with Oracle Data Integrator 11g: A Hands-On Tutorial","authors":["Peter Boyd-Bowman","Bernard Wheeler"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"May 2012","description":"This book is your go-to guide for mastering Oracle Data Integrator 11g through practical, hands-on instructions.

This is a gem of a book that every college teacher should read.\" —Ken Bain, author, What the Best College Students Do\n\nSince the original publication of L. Dee Fink's Creating Significant Learning Experiences, higher education has continued to move in two opposite directions: more institutions encourage faculty to focus on research, obtaining grants, and publishing, while accreditation agencies, policy-makers, and students themselves emphasize the need for greater attention to the quality of teaching and learning.\n\nNow the author has updated his bestselling classic, providing busy faculty with invaluable conceptual and procedural tools for instructional design. Step by step, Fink shows how to use a taxonomy of significant learning and systematically combine the best research-based practices for learning-centered teaching with a teaching strategy in a way that results in powerful learning experiences.\n\nThis edition addresses new research on how people learn, active learning, and student engagement; includes illustrative examples from online teaching; and reports on the effectiveness of Fink's time-tested model. Fink also explores recent changes in higher education nationally and internationally and offers more proven strategies for dealing with student resistance to innovative teaching.\n\nTapping into the knowledge, tools, and strategies in Creating Significant Learning Experiences empowers educators to creatively design courses that will result in significant learning for their students.\n\n\"As thought-provoking and inspiring today as it was when it was first published, it is a 'must' for anyone serious about creating courses that challenge students to learn deeply.\" —Elizabeth F.

Over time, some themes are dropped, and new concerns incorporated. This makes older and classical texts less relevant, and necessitates a process of selection and reprioritization of themes to meet changing times. Hence the need for new textbooks, especially one as detailed and concise as Sociology: A Study of the Social Sphere. The book serves as an invitation to sociology and it helps the reader to learn the language that sociologists employ, and the way commonly used words (such as family, marriage, caste) are given distinct definitions. It follows the logic of scientific research that governs sociological analysis.

It represents a work of anthropology in its widest sense, exploring themes such as the social meaning of natural symbols and the image of the body in society. This work focuses on the ways in which cultures select natural symbols from the body and how every natural symbol carries a social meaning. She also introduces her grid/group theory, which she sees as a way of keeping together what the social sciences divide and separate.\n\nBringing anthropology in to the realm of religion, Douglas enters into the ongoing debate in religious circles surrounding meaning and ritual. The book not only provides a clear explanation to four distinct attitudes to religion, but also defends hierarchical forms of religious organization and attempts to retain a balanced judgement between fundamentalism and established religion.

But this type of leadership—what Dean Williams calls \"counterfeit leadership\"—generates an unhealthy dependence on an authority figure and relies on dominance, control, and group seduction to get things done. By hampering people's ability to anticipate and react to changing circumstances, it creates a self-limiting cycle. And if the leader's vision is flawed, the entire organization suffers.The true task of a leader, Williams argues, is to get people to face the reality of any situation themselves and develop strategies to deal with problems or take advantage of opportunities. Real leaders don't dictate; they help people face their challenges and make adjustments in their values, habits, practices, and priorities to ensure the enterprise is given its best chance to succeed. Williams details how to apply this new approach to the challenges every organization or community faces. Throughout, he demonstrates the practical application of real leadership in the real world through examples from his own experiences working with organizations as diverse as the government of Singapore, Aetna Life and Casualty, and the nomadic Penan tribe in Borneo, as well as historical examples and the insights gleaned from his many interviews with presidents, prime ministers, and business leaders.

However, in his analysis, the author also shows that how international politics today also signals the possibility of a multipolar world. The rise of China as a major military and economic power, the potential of Russia, India and Germany as tomorrow's big powers and the success of the European Union and ASEAN as economic and political blocs of considerable substance point towards the feasibility of a multipolar world. Other than covering the change in the world order post Cold War and on the face of emerging issues in international relations such as environment, terrorism and globalization, this book has added discussion on two important theories, namely, the English School and Critical Theory and updated content on foreign policies of major powers.","tags":["Other","Politics & Global Issues"]},{"id":"9781118735381","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Globalization and Development Reader: Perspectives on Development and Global Change, 2nd Edition","authors":["J.

Great coaching for anyone who is even thinking of becoming an executive!”Marshall Goldsmith, New York Times bestselling author of What Got You Here Won’t Get You There\n\n“On the corporate battlefield a true leader’s success is based upon his or her ability to communicate effectively, persuade others to follow a goal, and execute it. This leads to success for all. When the stakes are high, you’re well advised to read this book first.”Scott A. Gaines, vice president, Hertz Corporation\n\n“If you are seriously looking to be perceived in the light you choose, Executive Presence is the book that not only answers the question, but shows you how to apply the answers.”Kevin Hogan, author of The Psychology of Persuasion\n\n“Harrison Monarth is a first-rate thinker who writes as clearly as he thinks. No matter where you are on the career ladder, Executive Presence will put you a step ahead of your competition.”T. Scott Gross, author of Positively Outrageous Service\n\n“Most people know that to move up in your career, you need to have self-awareness and the ability to manage the perceptions of those whose opinions count. . . . Executive Presence is your comprehensive guide to help you become more profi cient at self-marketing and the art of ethical persuasion to achieve your personal and professional goals.”Larina Kase, PsyD, MBA, author of The Confident Leader and coauthor of the New York Times bestseller The Confident Speaker\n\nAbout the Book\n\nAn expert in coaching high-level players in the art of perception management, Harrison Monarth reveals the critical difference between CEOs and those of us who wish to be CEOs. It’s not a matter of intelligence, connections, or luck. It can be summed up in two words: executive presence.\n\nWhile most of us toil in obscurity and expect great things to follow, those on the path to corporate leadership spend their time perfecting the types of leadership communication skills that generate respect and get others to share their vision. They use these skills to establish how they are perceived by others and to manage their reputation throughout the organization. In other words, these soon-tobe top players have developed the presence of an executive through careful image management—and they make sure they have the goods to back it up.\n\nIn Executive Presence, Monarth shows how you can seize control of your own career using the same skills. Inside, he explains how to:\n\nAccurately “read” people and predict their behavior\nInfluence the perceptions of others\nPersuade those of opposing views to your side\nCreate and maintain a personal “brand”\nManage and control your online reputation\nPerform damage control when things go wrong\n\nMonarth’s conclusions aren’t based solely on his keen insight and extensive experience; they’re the result of the latest scientifi c research in interpersonal communication and human behavior.\n\nTalent and skills are important, but they alone won’t take you to the top of your organization. People reach highly infl uential positions because they deeply understand the power of perception and know how to leverage it in their favor. The good news is, anyone with the will to succeed can do it. Executive Presence provides all the techniques you need to take your career to the highest level of any organization.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781119674795","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Home Buying Kit For Dummies, 7th Edition","authors":["Eric Tyson","Ray Brown"],"pages":"448","publication_date":"April 2020","description":"Negotiate a great price\nFind your best mortgage\nDiscover applications and checklists online\n\nGet the Best Deal on Your New Home!\n\nWhen it comes to buying a home, it's hard to know where to begin.

Much depends on the specific circumstances, as the works by philosophers, theologians, poets, artists, and medical practitioners have regularly demonstrated. It would not be good enough, as previous scholarship has commonly done, to examine simply what the various writers or artists had to say about nature. While modern scientists consider just the hard-core data of the objective world, cultural historians and literary scholars endeavor to comprehend the deeper meaning of the concept of nature presented by countless writers and artists. Only when we have a good grasp of the interactions between people and their natural environment, are we in a position to identify and interpret mental structures, social and economic relationships, medical and scientific concepts of human health, and the messages about all existence as depicted in major art works. In light of the current conditions threatening to bring upon us a global crisis, it matters centrally to take into consideration pre-modern discourses on nature and its enormous powers to understand the topoi and tropes determining the concepts through which we perceive nature.

In a word: RESPECT\n\nThe best leaders are the ones who motivate employees to want to perform at the highest level possible--which is never accomplished with an iron-fist style of management. The best results are achieved through one of the most basic human behaviors: the showing of respect.\n\nOrganizational change expert Paul Meshanko has studied how the human brain responds in various workplace situations--and his conclusion is astonishing: People perform at their highest level when treated with respect. Conversely, when an employee is emotionally attacked by disrespectful behavior, he or she shuts down. In The Respect Effect, Meshanko reveals the transformational power of respect in the workplace.\n\nGiven the pressures of the workplace, this is sometimes easier said than done. So Meshanko provides a practical action plan you can use to train yourself or others to get on track--and stay on track. His proven strategy helps you understand the initial, biological reactions to what people (This means you!) say and do.\n\nThrough his cited research in neuroscience, Meshanko teaches you how to create positive situations, avoid negative ones, and ultimately build a better work environment for everyone. The Respect Effect explains:\n\nThe hard science proving why respect is the most powerful employee motivator\nHow to build a corporate culture based on respect, starting with senior leadership\nThe 12 Rules of Respect--simple but powerful ways to communicate respectfully in any situation\nThe strategy, resource requirements, and tools for sustaining a respectful workplace culture\n\nHow do you use the concept of neuroscience to achieve a great work environment? The answer is obvious. Feed others a diet of respect--real, deserved, genuine respect--and you will see amazing things happen in your organization.\n\nUse Meshanko's proven approach to organizational change to create a culture of contagious respect in your organization.\n\nPRAISE FOR THE RESPECT EFFECT:\n\n\"The Respect Effect reminds us of the critical role relationships play in the workforce. . . . A great read for new and experienced leaders!\" -- ANNEMARIE M. GRASSI, PH.D., CEO, Open Doors Academy\n\n\"The Respect Effect offers concise, engaging learning, not only for business leaders, but for anyone working in an organization where developing an inclusive and productive work environment is a priority. Respect is a powerful principle for businesses to understand and practice--this book will contribute much to its advancement.\" -- RICK CHIRICOSTA, President and CEO, Medical Mutual\n\n\"[Meshanko] shows how demonstrating respect to employees leads to better health and well-being for both the organization and the individual. Whether you are a supervisor, manager, VP, or small business owner, The Respect Effect will make you a more effective leader.\" -- PAUL MARCIANO, PH.D., author, Carrots and Sticks Don't Work\n\n\"In The Respect Effect, Paul Meshanko shows that respect is the foundation for interpersonal trust, revealing why high-trust organizations are successful. The step-by-step process Meshanko outlines to cultivate and nurture respect provides a new leverage point to increase employee satisfaction and productivity.\" -- PAUL J.

Employees today are highly trained and independent-they can offer much more to an enterprise than simply their obedience. And with the relationship between worker and organization constantly changing, no one person will likely be able to lead alone. Creating Leaderful Organizations presents a paradigm of leadership tailored to our times, one that is based on mutual-rather than heroic-leadership.It is not merely consultative, with leaders graciously allowing followers to participate in leadership, nor is it a stewardship approach in which the leader occasionally steps aside to allow others to take over temporarily. It is a revolutionary new approach that transforms leadership from an individual property to a collective responsibility. Raelin details how \"leaderful\" practice can accomplish the critical processes of leadership more effectively than any existing approach. And using actual examples from leading-edge organizations, he offers practical guidance for assessing your own and others' leaderful predisposition, preparing for leaderful practice, distributing leadership roles, and dealing with resistance to change.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781848218017","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"MOOCs: Design, Use and Business Models","authors":["Jean-Charles Pomerol","Yves Epelboin","Claire Thoury"],"pages":"142","publication_date":"March 2015","description":"MOOCs (Massive Online Open Courses) are shaking up the traditional forms of primary and continuing education and training.

Recognizing that globalization cannot be wished away, the author turns to the proper question: how can we ensure that its potential contribution to welfare is not lost?”\n\n     —William Baumol, Emeritus Professor, Princeton University, and co-author of Downsizing in America: Reality, Causes and Consequences\n\n“Robert Isaak is unique among critics of Globalization in that he accepts it as inevitable but goes determinedly to propose innovations that can make it work better economically and socially for the rich and the poor.”\n\n“Robert Isaak's new book presents fresh ideas on globalization that will enrich a polarized debate between the pessimists and the hyper-optimists. His work brings back Ortega y Gasset classic ideas of the late 1930’s when the \"masses\" brought down globalization and with it the worst recession and the bloodiest war. I am sure that Isaak's book will guide the readers to look forward after learning from past ideas and experiences.”\n\n     —Jorge Pinto, former Ambassador of Mexico and member of the Board of the World Bank. Director of the Center for Global Finance\n\nFor most people except the world’s very richest, globalization is failing—catastrophically. If we don’t act, its failure will lead to a global upheaval worse than any in human history. But there’s another, better path. Isaak shows how a new globalization can give the poor a powerful stake, both here and abroad. Isaak's ideas can lead toward a more stable, peaceful world, in which we can all build our futures—rich and poor alike.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","Political Science"]},{"id":"9780470933114","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Engaged Leadership: Building a Culture to Overcome Employee Disengagement, 2nd Edition","authors":["Clint Swindall"],"pages":"224","publication_date":"March 2011","description":"Praise for Engaged Leadership, second edition\n\n\"Engaged Leadership is the best of both worlds: an engaging business story coupled with a primer on the practical skills all leaders need.

The explosive growth of the \"leadership industry\" is based on the belief that leading is a path to power and money, a medium for achievement, and a mechanism for creating change. But there are other, parallel truths: that leaders of every stripe are in disrepute; that the tireless and often superficial teaching of leadership has brought us no closer to nirvana; and that followers nearly everywhere have become, on the one hand, disappointed and disillusioned, and, on the other, entitled and emboldened.\n\nThe End of Leadership tells two tales. The first is about change—about how and why leadership and followership have changed over time, especially in the last forty years. As a result of cultural evolution and technological revolution, the balance of power between leaders and followers has shifted—with leaders becoming weaker and followers stronger.\n\nThe second narrative is about the leadership industry itself. In this provocative and critical volume, Barbara Kellerman raises questions about leadership as both a scholarly pursuit and a set of practical skills: Does the industry do what it claims to do—grow leaders? Does the research justify the undertaking? Do we adequately measure the results of our efforts? Are leaders as all-important as we think they are? What about followers? Isn't teaching good followership as important now as teaching good leadership? Finally, Kellerman asks: Given the precipitous decline of leaders in the estimation of their followers, are there alternatives to the existing models—ways of teaching leadership that take into account the vicissitudes of the twenty-first century?\n\nThe End of Leadership takes on all these questions and then some—making it necessary reading for business, political, and community leaders alike.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781804611036","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"The Art of Data-Driven Business","authors":["Alan Bernardo Palacio"],"pages":"314","publication_date":"December 2022","description":"Learn how to integrate data-driven methodologies and machine learning into your business decision-making processes with 'The Art of Data-Driven Business.'

Customers, employees, and investors are making it clear that they want companies to do more than provide good products, good prospects, and good profits—they want companies to do some social good too. Ironically, as this extremely timely book demonstrates, purpose-driven companies do better on nearly every traditional metric: greater customer loyalty, higher retention, more innovation, and a healthier bottom line. But how do you become a purpose-driven company? Just crafting an inspiring new mission statement and starting a CSR program won't cut it, says John Izzo, who predicted the purpose revolution in his 1994 book Awakening Corporate Soul. Purpose must pervade every part of your organization. In this thoroughly researched hands-on guide, Izzo and Jeff Vanderwielen provide a tool kit for deeply embedding purpose into your leadership and organizational culture.Using scores of real-world examples and practical exercises, Izzo and Vanderwielen help leaders find a truly authentic purpose, one that is a natural fit for them and their organization. They describe concrete actions leaders can take to ensure that employees own it, customers and recruits connect with it, and every corporate action and activity reflects it. They show leaders how to avoid common pitfalls on the path to purpose and how to use purpose to guide all their decision making. In an increasingly crowded economic landscape, purpose gives you a powerful competitive advantage. But it does more than that. Finding and communicating an inspiring purpose will revitalize the entire organization, top to bottom. Purpose makes business more rewarding in every sense.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781118832912","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Healthcare Valuation: The Financial Appraisal of Enterprises, Assets, and Services, Volume 2","authors":["Robert James Cimasi"],"pages":"1152","publication_date":"March 2014","description":"A timely look at the healthcare valuation process in an era of dynamic healthcare reform, including theory, methodology, and professional standards\n\nIn light of the dynamic nature of the healthcare industry sector, the analysis supporting business valuation engagements for healthcare enterprises, assets, and services must address the expected economic conditions and events resulting from the four pillars of the healthcare industry: Reimbursement, Regulation, Competition, and Technology.

But this type of leadership—what Dean Williams calls \"counterfeit leadership\"—generates an unhealthy dependence on an authority figure and relies on dominance, control, and group seduction to get things done. By hampering people's ability to anticipate and react to changing circumstances, it creates a self-limiting cycle. And if the leader's vision is flawed, the entire organization suffers.The true task of a leader, Williams argues, is to get people to face the reality of any situation themselves and develop strategies to deal with problems or take advantage of opportunities. Real leaders don't dictate; they help people face their challenges and make adjustments in their values, habits, practices, and priorities to ensure the enterprise is given its best chance to succeed. Williams details how to apply this new approach to the challenges every organization or community faces. Throughout, he demonstrates the practical application of real leadership in the real world through examples from his own experiences working with organizations as diverse as the government of Singapore, Aetna Life and Casualty, and the nomadic Penan tribe in Borneo, as well as historical examples and the insights gleaned from his many interviews with presidents, prime ministers, and business leaders. At a time when so many “visionary” leaders have led their organizations to disaster, Real Leadership offers a needed, proven alternative.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"059600866X","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Repairing and Upgrading Your PC","authors":["Robert Bruce Thompson","Barbara Fritchman Thompson"],"pages":"448","publication_date":"March 2006","description":"Most computer users think that fiddling with the insides of their PC is taboo.

In today's chaotic, high-stakes business environment, it is easy to get distracted from leadership responsibilities by focusing on tasks at hand instead of on strategy.

Much depends on the specific circumstances, as the works by philosophers, theologians, poets, artists, and medical practitioners have regularly demonstrated. It would not be good enough, as previous scholarship has commonly done, to examine simply what the various writers or artists had to say about nature. While modern scientists consider just the hard-core data of the objective world, cultural historians and literary scholars endeavor to comprehend the deeper meaning of the concept of nature presented by countless writers and artists. Only when we have a good grasp of the interactions between people and their natural environment, are we in a position to identify and interpret mental structures, social and economic relationships, medical and scientific concepts of human health, and the messages about all existence as depicted in major art works. In light of the current conditions threatening to bring upon us a global crisis, it matters centrally to take into consideration pre-modern discourses on nature and its enormous powers to understand the topoi and tropes determining the concepts through which we perceive nature. Nature thus proves to be a force far beyond all human comprehensibility, being both material and spiritual depending on our critical approaches.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences"]},{"id":"9781315518190","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"International Enterprise Education","authors":["Jason Turner","Gary Mulholland"],"pages":"280","publication_date":"January 2018","description":"This innovative and comprehensive text is designed as a ‘seminal resource’ on enterprise education that collates the diverse contributions of enterprising Universities and colleges across the globe supporting a range of academic stakeholders.

In a word: RESPECT\n\nThe best leaders are the ones who motivate employees to want to perform at the highest level possible--which is never accomplished with an iron-fist style of management. The best results are achieved through one of the most basic human behaviors: the showing of respect.\n\nOrganizational change expert Paul Meshanko has studied how the human brain responds in various workplace situations--and his conclusion is astonishing: People perform at their highest level when treated with respect. Conversely, when an employee is emotionally attacked by disrespectful behavior, he or she shuts down. In The Respect Effect, Meshanko reveals the transformational power of respect in the workplace.\n\nGiven the pressures of the workplace, this is sometimes easier said than done. So Meshanko provides a practical action plan you can use to train yourself or others to get on track--and stay on track. His proven strategy helps you understand the initial, biological reactions to what people (This means you!) say and do.\n\nThrough his cited research in neuroscience, Meshanko teaches you how to create positive situations, avoid negative ones, and ultimately build a better work environment for everyone. The Respect Effect explains:\n\nThe hard science proving why respect is the most powerful employee motivator\nHow to build a corporate culture based on respect, starting with senior leadership\nThe 12 Rules of Respect--simple but powerful ways to communicate respectfully in any situation\nThe strategy, resource requirements, and tools for sustaining a respectful workplace culture\n\nHow do you use the concept of neuroscience to achieve a great work environment?

Younger"],"pages":"192","publication_date":"April 2021","description":"If your people know you care about them, they will move mountains. Employee engagement and loyalty expert Heather Younger outlines nine ways to manifest the radical power of caring support in the workplace.Heather Younger argues that if you are looking for increased productivity, customer satisfaction, or employee engagement, you need to care for your employees first. People will go the extra mile for leaders who show they are genuinely concerned not just with what employees can do but with who they are and can become. But while most leaders think of themselves as caring leaders, not all demonstrate that care in consistent ways. Your employees will judge you by your actions, not your intentions. Based on Younger's interviews with over eighty leaders for her podcast Leadership with Heart—including Howard Behar, former president of the Starbucks Coffee Company; Judith Scimone, senior vice president and chief talent officer at MetLife; Garry Ridge, CEO and chairman of the board of the WD-40 Company; and Shawnté Cox Holland, head of culture and engagement at Vanguard—this book outlines nine ways that leaders can make all employees feel included and cared for. She even provides access to a self-assessment so you can measure your progress as a caring leader. But this is not a cookie-cutter approach: just as Monet and Picasso expressed themselves very differently, each leader should express caring in his or her own unique, personal style. Younger takes an often nebulous, subjective concept and makes it concrete and actionable. Leaders have the power to change the lives of those they lead. They shouldn't just want to care, they should see caring as imperative for the success of their employees and their organization.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9780415592208","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"China and Orientalism","authors":["Daniel Vukovich"],"pages":"190","publication_date":"June 2013","description":"This book argues that there is a new, Sinological form of orientalism at work in the world. It has shifted from a logic of ‘essential difference’ to one of ‘sameness’ or general equivalence. \"China\" is now in a halting but inevitable process of becoming-the-same as the USA and the West. Orientalism is now closer to the cultural logic of capitalism, even as it shows the afterlives of colonial discourse. This shift reflects our era of increasing globalization; the migration of orientalism to area studies and the pax Americana; the liberal triumph at the \"end\" of history and the demonization of Maoism; an ever closer Sino-West relationship; and the overlapping of anti-communist and colonial discourses.\n\nTo make the case for this re-constitution of orientalism, this work offers an inter-disciplinary analysis of the China field broadly defined. Vukovich takes on specialist work on the politics, governance, and history of the Mao and reform eras, from the Great Leap Forward to Tiananmen, 1989; the Western study of Chinese film; recent work in critical theory which turns on ‘the China-reference\"; and other global texts about or from China. Through extensive analysis, the production of Sinological knowledge is shown to be of a piece with Western global intellectual political culture.\n\nThis work will be of great interest to scholars of Asian, postcolonial and cultural studies.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences"]},{"id":"9781952157172","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Troubleshooting for Trainers","authors":["Sophie Oberstein"],"pages":"360","publication_date":"October 2020","description":"Your Fix-It Guide to Training\n\nWhen you need to repair an appliance on the fritz, you can consult the instruction manual.

What is the antidote to this? Ruthless Consistency.\n\nAccording to Harvard Business Review, “most studies still show a 60-70% failure rate for organizational change projects—a statistic that has stayed constant from the 1970s to the present.” Drawing on his 20+ years of experience as a strategy and execution consultant specializing in midsize companies, Michael Canic helps committed leaders drive the odds in their favor. In Ruthless Consistency, he identifies the three surprising reasons most strategic change initiatives fail:\n\nLeaders unwittingly send mixed messages that demotivate their people and undermine those initiatives.\nLeaders focus on what they do instead of what their people experience.\nLeaders are not as committed as they think they are or need to be.\n\nThe book then introduces an intuitive yet comprehensive model for success. Simply put, leaders who develop the right focus, create the right environment, and build the right team—consistently—are leaders whose organizations win. Finally, it details each element of the model and offers ready-to-apply processes, practices, techniques, and tools to make it happen. It’s a must-read for every leader who wants to implement change successfully.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9780415721295","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Peacebuilding, Memory and Reconciliation","authors":["Bruno Charbonneau","Genevieve Parent"],"pages":"262","publication_date":"June 2013","description":"This book aims to bridge the gap between what are generally referred to as ‘top-down’ and ‘bottom-up’ approaches to peacebuilding.\n\nAfter the experience of a physical and psychological trauma, the period of individual healing and recovery is intertwined with political and social reconciliation.

And even if the desire to change is there, understanding of how to achieve it is elusive. This book holds the key. It introduces the Shift Evolutionary Leadership Framework (SELF), which helps leaders create the understanding and application needed to evolve high performance. At the core of the book are dozens of business patterns that cut across seven dimensions of organizational functioning. The traps of traditional organizations are contrasted with the high-performance practices of evolutionary organizations.

In Five Dimensions of Quality: A Common Sense Guide to Accreditation and Accountability in Higher Education she provides a simple, straightforward model for understanding and meeting the calls for increased quality in higher education ever-present in today's culture. Whether your institution is seeking accreditation or not, the five dimensions she outlines will help you to identify ways to improve institutional quality and demonstrate that quality to constituents.\n\nFor those wading through the accreditation process, which has become more difficult in recent years due to increasing regulation and pressure for greater accountability, Suskie offers expert guidance on understanding the underlying principles of the expectations of accrediting bodies. Using the model presented here, which is much easier to understand than the sometimes complex resources provided by individual accrediting bodies, American colleges and universities can understand what they need to do to earn and maintain their regional accreditation as well as improve overall institutional quality for their students. You'll be able to:\n\nIdentify ways to improve institutional quality\n\nDemonstrate the quality of your institution to internal and external constituents\n\nAvoid wasting time and energy on misguided institutional processes to comply with accreditation requirements\n\nBy focusing on why colleges and universities should take particular actions rather than only on what those actions should be, Five Dimensions of Quality gives them the knowledge and strategies to prepare for a successful review.

With eye-opening case studies and recommended behaviors in every chapter, it's an indispensable user guide for servant leaders.”—Ken Blanchard, coauthor of The New One Minute Manager and coeditor of Servant Leadership in ActionOn the most fundamental level, leaders must bring divergent groups together and forge a consensus on a path forward. But what makes that possible? Humility—a deep regard for the dignity of others—is the key, says distinguished leadership educator Marilyn Gist.Leadership is a relationship, and humility is the foundation for all healthy relationships. Leader humility can increase engagement and retention. It inspires and motivates. Gist offers a model of leader humility derived from three questions people ask of their leaders: Who are you? Where are we going? Do you see me? She explores each of these questions in depth, as well as the six key qualities of leader humility: a balanced ego, integrity, a compelling vision, ethical strategies, generous inclusion, and a developmental focus. Much of this book is based on Gist's interviews with a dozen distinguished leaders of organizations such as the Mayo Clinic, Costco, REI, Alaska Airlines, Starbucks, and others. And the foreword and a guest chapter are written by Alan Mulally, the legendary leader who brought Ford back from the brink of bankruptcy after the 2008 financial collapse and whose work is an exemplar of leader humility.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781947843363","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Leading the High-Performing Company","authors":["Heidi Pozzo"],"pages":"186","publication_date":"July 2018","description":"Leading the High-Performing Company demystifies performance.

In the management context leadership has been consistently identified as playing a critical role in the success or failure of organizations and some surveys have pegged almost half of an organization’s performance on the quality and effectiveness of its leadership team. Apart from organizational performance, researchers have consistently found a strong correlation between leadership styles and behaviors and the job satisfaction and performance of subordinates.\n\nWhen formal interest in the study of leadership first began in the 19th and early 20th centuries, the so-called “great man” theory, which assumed that certain individual characteristics or traits could be found in leaders but not in non-leaders and that those characteristics could not be developed but must be inherited, was quite popular and many assumed that leaders were simply “born and not made”. As time passed, however, the consensus within the community of leadership scholars and consultants shifted significantly to the current working proposition that while some people do indeed appear to be natural leaders from birth it is nonetheless possible for many others with sufficient desire and willpower to develop into a “leader” by following a continuous process of work, self-study, education, training and experience.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781592534289","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Cutting-Edge Patterns and Textures","authors":["Estel Vilaseca"],"pages":"336","publication_date":"April 2008","description":"113 unique and original patterns After a goldmine of cultural and subconscious information, the history of patterns parallels and informs the history of humanity.","tags":["Data","AI & ML","Machine Learning","Machine Learning Methods","Pattern Recognition"]},{"id":"9781118459102","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Leading with Conviction: Mastering the Nine Critical Pillars of Integrated Leadership","authors":["Shalom Saada Saar","Michael J.

Creating Leaderful Organizations presents a paradigm of leadership tailored to our times, one that is based on mutual-rather than heroic-leadership.It is not merely consultative, with leaders graciously allowing followers to participate in leadership, nor is it a stewardship approach in which the leader occasionally steps aside to allow others to take over temporarily. It is a revolutionary new approach that transforms leadership from an individual property to a collective responsibility. Raelin details how \"leaderful\" practice can accomplish the critical processes of leadership more effectively than any existing approach.

While some people have too little food and die as a consequence, some people have too much food and die from associated diseases. Furthermore, some methods of food production create social dislocation and deadly environments where biodiversity is eroded and pollution is rampant.  While guaranteeing enough food for the world’s inhabitants continues to be a serious challenge, new issues about food have emerged.\n\nFood and Development is a lively and lucidly written text which provides a clear and accessible introduction to these complex and diverse food related problems.  It explores the continued prevalence of mass under nutrition in the developing world; acute food crises in some places associated with conflict; the emergence of over nutrition in the developing world and the vulnerability of the contemporary global food production system. The text identifies the major problems and analyzes factors at international, national and local scales to understand their continued prevalence. The book concludes by evaluating the potential of some oppositional forces to challenge the hegemony of the contemporary food system.\n\nThis timely and original text will be invaluable to undergraduates interested in the challenges surrounding food and development. The text is richly filled with case studies from the Global North and South to illustrate the nature and extent of these urgent issues and their interrelated nature. Each chapter contains a range of features to assist undergraduate learning, including: learning objective, key concepts, summaries, discussion questions, further reading and websites, and follow up activities.","tags":["Other","Politics & Global Issues"]},{"id":"9781118594988","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Social Media, Sociality, and Survey Research","authors":["Craig A.

It's like riding a roller coaster: sudden drops, jarring turns, anxious climbs into the unknown. Drawing on his years of experience at the Center for Creative Leadership and Columbia University, Bill Pasmore offers a four-part model and four mindsets that allow leaders to deal with multiple changes simultaneously without drowning in the churn. The first step, Pasmore says, is to Discover which external pressures for change are the most necessary to address. The key here is to think fewer—step away from the buffet of possibilities and pinpoint the highest-impact options. Then you need to Decide how many change efforts your organization can handle. Here the mindset is to think scarcer—you have only so many people and so many resources, so how do you best use them? Once you've figured that out, it's time to Do—and here you want to think faster. Streamline processes and engage in rapid prototyping so you can learn quickly and cost-effectively. The last step is to Discern what worked and what didn't, so think smarter—develop metrics, identify trends, and make sure learnings are disseminated throughout the organization.For each stage of the process, Pasmore offers detailed advice, practical tools, and real-world examples.

But this parade of dysfunctions and messy \"people\" problems actually points to an organization confused about its core business, torn between competing ideas about what it is and wants to be—an organization facing an identity crisis.\n\nStrategy and leadership expert Chatham Sullivan argues that when the purpose of a business becomes confused, it is the leaders' responsibility to restore clarity, especially in the face of tough strategic choices that have political, personal, and cultural consequences for the organization. Sullivan shows leaders how to take the decisive stand that clarifies their organization's core purpose.\n\nFeaturing compelling stories of leaders who have succumbed to and successfully resolved their organizations' identity crises, The Clarity Principle bridges the gap between leadership and strategy and demonstrates the tremendous gains to be achieved by leaders willing to make tough choices.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9780062272874","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Rumsfeld's Rules - Leadership Lessons in Business, Politics, War, and Life","authors":["Donald Rumsfeld"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"May 2013","description":"The legendary leadership guide, distilled from a lifetime of wisdom and experience in government and business\n\nThroughout his long and distinguished career—as a naval aviator, a U.S. Congressman, a top aide to four American presidents, a high-level diplomat, a CEO of two Fortune 500 companies, and the only twice-serving Secretary of Defense in American history—Donald Rumsfeld has collected hundreds of pithy, compelling, and often humorous observations about leadership, business, and life. When President Gerald Ford ordered these aphorisms distributed to his White House staff in 1974, the collection became known as \"Rumsfeld's Rules.\"\n\nFirst gathered as three-by-five cards in a shoebox and then typed up and circulated informally over the years, these eminently nonpartisan rules have amused and enlightened presidents, business executives, chiefs of staff, foreign officials, diplomats, and members of Congress.  They earned praise from the Wall Street Journal as \"Required reading,\" and from the New York Times which said: \"Rumsfeld's Rules can be profitably read in any organization…The best reading, though, are his sprightly tips on inoculating oneself against that dread White House disease, the inflated ego.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the collection continued to grow as Rumsfeld added new rules derived from things he read, heard, or observed in more than eight decades of a remarkable life. Now these legendary rules are made available for the first time to corporate executive. Rumsfeld has selected his most useful and important rules for effective leadership, enhanced with fresh insights and entertaining anecdotes, and discusses them in the blunt and witty style that made his Pentagon press conferences \"must-see TV.\"\n\nDistilled from a career of unusual breadth and accomplishment, and organized under practical topics like hiring people, running a meeting, and dealing with the press, Rumsfeld's Rules can benefit people at every stage in their careers and in every walk of life, from aspiring politicos and industrialists to recent college graduates, teachers, and business leaders.\n\nThe book provides unprecedented insight into leadership, management, strategy, and life—thinking that not only helped Rumsfeld lead the Pentagon in wartime, but earned him a reputation as one of America's toughest and most effective CEOs.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","History"]},{"id":"9781118646298","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Leadership Blindspots: How Successful Leaders Identify and Overcome the Weaknesses That Matter","authors":["Robert B.

Written by a 30-year veteran of the leadership consulting industry and author of Trust in the Balance, the book contains examples, worksheets and surveys that illustrate the practical application of the advice presented. An online questionnaire helps readers discover their own leadership vulnerabilities, and the book provides a roadmap for creating a targeted plan to increase their awareness in the areas that truly matter.\n\nThe blindspot risk is that leaders fail to respond to weaknesses or threats due to a variety of factors including the complexity of their organizations, over-confidence in their own capabilities, and being surrounded by deferential subordinates. Leadership Blindspots provides a useful model for understanding how blindspots operate and why they persist, but at the same time suggests real, actionable steps to improvement. The book details a range of techniques that make blindspots stand out in sharp relief, so action can be taken before severe damage occurs - to a leader or his or her company. Topics include:\n\nA framework to understand the threats posed by blindspots\n\nThe four most important types of blindspots - self, team, company and markets\n\nDetailed case studies of blindspots in leaders across a variety of industries\n\nA summary of the most common leadership blindspots\n\nCorrective practices that help mitigate the risks that blindspots pose\n\nThe one characteristic great leaders share is the constant desire for self-improvement. Good can always be better. These weaknesses and threats are called blindspots because they are invisible to the individual but have the potential to wreak havoc on one's reputation and long-term success.

Most people think we have to make a binary choice between being a good human being and being a tough, effective leader. But this is a false dichotomy.

In terms of topics covered and perspectives taken, it is equally well suited for undergraduate as well as postgraduate students of linguistics and/or philosophy of language.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","Linguistics"]},{"id":"9781637424377","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"When Graduation’s Over, Learning Begins","authors":["Roger Forsgren"],"pages":"158","publication_date":"February 2023","description":"What They Didn’t Teach You in School: Lessons for STEM Students and Professionals\n\nScience, Technology, Engineering, and Math education has been described as, “drinking from a firehose.” STEM students are required to absorb an overwhelming amount of technical information before they can earn their undergraduate degrees.

In Homeownership at Any Cost, Andrew Jeffery tells this hidden story, shining a light on NAR’s outsized role in designing U.S. housing policies for nearly a century and examining accusations that it played a key role in inflating the housing bubble that nearly destroyed the global financial system. Jeffery recounts the NAR’s absurdly rosy projections about real estate markets in the years running up to the mortgage meltdown, showing how the organization has managed to fly “under the radar” while other market players have been pilloried by the media and policy makers. He concludes by revealing the crucial behind-the-scenes role NAR is playing right now in the debate over remaking U.S. housing policy, its self-serving attempts to rewrite federal mortgage policy to suit its own ends, and its advocacy of a near-complete abdication of the mortgage market to the federal government.","tags":["Other","Real Estate"]},{"id":"9781604914375","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Leadership in Action: Getting a Grip on Conflict","authors":["Davida Sharpe"],"pages":"5","publication_date":"October 2001","description":"The ability to manage conflict plays a key role in determining whether an executive will continue on a successful career path or will derail.

However, few detailed ethnographic works exist on the ritual practices of these societies. Based on long-term ethnographic fieldwork in Jharkhand, India this book offers insights into contemporary, previously not described rituals of the Santal, one of the largest indigenous societies of Central India. Its focus lies on culturally specific notions of place as articulated and created during these rituals.\n\nIn three chapters the book discusses how the Santal \"make place\" on different local, regional and global levels through their rituals: They reaffirm their ancestral roots in their land during large sacrificial rituals. They offer sacrifices to the dangerous deities of the forest in exchange for rain. And they claim their region to be a \"Santal region\" through large festivals celebrated in sacred groves, which they link to national and global discourses of indigeneity and environmentalism.\n\nThrough an analysis of the rituals of a specific society, this book addresses broader issues. It presents an example of how to study religion as a practical activity. It portrays culture-specific perceptions of the environment. And last, the book underlines the potential that lies in choosing place as a lens to study social phenomena in context.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences"]},{"id":"9781555583316","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Oracle 10g Developing Media Rich Applications","authors":["Lynne Dunckley","Larry Guros"],"pages":"520","publication_date":"April 2011","description":"Oracle 10g Developing Media Rich Applications is focused squarely on database administrators and programmers as the foundation of multimedia database applications.

Yet many executives and managers find that they have become leaders by default rather than as a result of a personal choice. In fact, a great many people drift into or away from being leaders simply because they have not done the work of matching their own honestly described self with the realities of the leadership role. Not until they are well into their careers do many individuals seriously explore their personal fit for leadership. But by then, it is often too late to prepare for more gratifying roles or to get out of situations that don't make sense for them as individuals.\n\nDiscovering the Leader in You offers a planful approach to understanding how aspects of personality, character, vision, home life, values, and skills match with essential leadership activities. This unique system of self-discovery clearly shows what it looks like to fit or not to fit in leadership roles in organizations.\n\nRobert J. Lee and Sara N. King, who developed this approach from their experience at the widely renowned Center for Creative Leadership in Greensboro, North Carolina, help leaders and potential leaders examine leadership commitments and development paths in the context of who they are as individuals. They show how to connect the inner self to the demands of leadership by using a set of questions that help (1) clarify the relevant realities and expectations in a leadership role, (2) bring out a personal vision and a leadership vision, (3) base leadership behaviors on personal values, (4) become more authentic in leadership situations, and (5) productively integrate work and personal lives.\n\nDiscovering the Leader in You will help all executives--seasoned veterans and those considering leading as a new direction in their careers--to gain more personal insight into what leadership really means to them, to retain more control over their career choices, and consequently to achieve more personal success as leaders.\n\n\"In the considerable literature on leadership, this book focuses on something new-how individuals can identify the key attributes of great leadership and link them to their own unique vision, values, and personal strengths. The authors provide a roadmap to self-knowledge that becomes a guide to maximizing effectiveness in the organization and in life.\"\n\n--Evelyn Rodstein, managing director, Leadership Organizational Development, J.P.

Two things are required: first, to replace the mind-as-container metaphor with one that envisions a mind capable of sustaining knowledgeable, intelligent behavior without actually containing stored beliefs; second, to recognize a fundamental difference between knowledge building and learning--both of which are essential parts of education for the knowledge age. Connectionism in cognitive science addresses the first need; certain developments in post-positivist epistemology address the second. The author explores both the theoretical bases and the practical educational implications of this radical change in viewpoint. The book draws on current new ways of thinking about knowledge and mind, including information processing, cognitive psychology, situated cognition, constructivism, social constructivism, and connectionism, but does not adhere strictly to any \"camp.\" Above all, the author is concerned with developing a way of thinking about the mind that can usher education into the knowledge age.

The more prepared you are to manage shocks, the less likely you’ll fall victim to the serious harm a crisis has the potential to inflict.\n\nCrisis management is one of several interrelated core disciplines comprising enterprise risk management, along with emergency preparedness, disaster response, business continuity planning, supply chain risk mitigation, and cyber liability prevention. Crisis management practices can help lessen the magnitude of emergencies and disasters while decreasing the uncertainty and anxiety associated with these events.\n\nThis book provides insights into an understanding of leadership in a new era of radical uncertainty and disruption brought about by other challenges such as climate change, financial crises, terrorism, demographic changes in the labor market, health/disease risk from the pandemic, and rapid developments in innovative digital technologies and its impact on transformation at the workplace.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9780782143720","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Oracle Database Foundations","authors":["Bob Bryla"],"pages":"349","publication_date":"October 2004","description":"The world of IT is always evolving, but in every area there are stable, core concepts that anyone just setting out needed to know last year, needs to know this year, and will still need to know next year.

Isolation forced on them by the pandemic, combined with America's growing political factionalism, threatened their bonds with community and family. Something had to change. Maggie's surprising answer: buy a boat, learn to pilot it, and embark on the Great Loop. For nine months Bruce and Maggie navigated rivers, coastal waters, lakes, locks, and loss. Against all odds, they conquered the Loop, and along the way found common cause across political divides with new friends while blowing the walls off their world.\n\nBruce and Maggie Tate were spiraling downward. Normally outgoing and cheerful, Maggie was broken down by pandemic isolation. Bruce, facing asthma, heart disease and Covid-related professional issues, was sure that the virus and his comorbidities would kill him. And the plant-based diet he had just started made him wish it would hurry up. Meanwhile, their country seemed to be crumbling into warring factions.\n\nThat was when Maggie made a life-changing decision. With no experience, knowing little about seafaring, inboard motors, or navigation, she and Bruce and the family dog decided to take on the Great Loop, a six-thousand-mile journey down inland rivers, around the Gulf and Atlantic coasts, and across the Great Lakes. They had to navigate canals and locks, were threatened by dangerous seas, and even had to deal with heartbreaking loss. But along the way, they made new lifelong friends and were forever changed.\n\nWhen, in a time of great divisiveness, two broken people took on the challenge of their lives, against all odds they found common cause across political divides and made themselves whole again.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","History"]},{"id":"9781633696037","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Humanocracy","authors":["Gary Hamel","Michele Zanini"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"August 2020","description":"A Wall Street Journal Bestseller\n\nIn a world of unrelenting change and unprecedented challenges, we need organizations that are resilient and daring.\n\nUnfortunately, most organizations, overburdened by bureaucracy, are sluggish and timid.

This book identifies seven dangerous habits even well-run companies fall victim to–and helps you diagnose and break these habits before they destroy you.

You’ll learn how an obsession with volume leads inexorably to rising costs and falling margins...how companies fall victim to denial, myth, ritual, and orthodoxy... how they start wasting vital energy on culture confl ict and turf wars...how they blind themselves to emerging competition...how they become arrogant, complacent, and far too dependent on their traditional competences.

You have to make good decisions while balancing inevitable tensions and knowing when to take risks. You need to keep your values in sight regardless of the pressures around you and stay calm in the storms that arise. At its core, leadership is a daily, ongoing practice, a journey toward becoming your best self and inviting others to do the same. And at the heart of this daily practice is courage. And that's where The Courage Way comes in. It's a guide to leadership that names and explores this important resource and shows leaders how to access and draw upon courage in all that they do. It has its roots in the work of Parker J. Palmer, who in fifty years of teaching, speaking, and writing has explored the human spirit—what he has called “the inner landscape”—and its role in life and leadership.Shelly Francis identifies key ingredients needed to cultivate courage, the most fundamental being trust—in ourselves and in each other. She describes the Center for Courage & Renewal's Circle of Trust approach, centered around eleven “touchstones,” poetic and practical operating guidelines for holding the meaningful conversations of inner work and trust building. Each chapter features true stories of how leaders in all kinds of settings have overcome challenges and strengthened their organizations through touchstones like “Extend invitation, not demand,” “No fixing, saving, advising, or correcting,” and “When the going gets rough, turn to wonder.”This graceful and inspiring book is a guide to courageous leadership and a journey of self-discovery—the two are inextricable. As Francis writes, “Courage is not only in you—it is you.

Up to half of the world's population is expected to be living in a city by the end of the century and there are over 170 cities in the world with populations over a million.\n\nCities have a huge impact on the local climate and require vast quantities of energy to keep them functioning. The urban environment in turn has a big impact on the performance and needs of buildings. The size, scale and mechanism of these interactions is poorly understood and strategies to mitigate them are rarely implemented.\n\nThis is the first comprehensive book to address these questions. It arises out of a programme of work (POLISTUDIES) carried out for the Save programme of the European Commission. Chapters describe not only the main problems encountered such as the heat island and canyon effects, but also a range of design solutions that can be adopted both to improve the energy performance and indoor air quality of individual buildings and to look at aspects of urban design that can reduce these climatic effects.The book concludes with some examples of innovative urban bioclimatic buildings.\n\nThe project was co-ordinated by Professor Mat Santamouris from the University of Athens who is also the editor of the book.

The authors of this book deal with multiple historical, religious, social, and cultural backgrounds and, in these contexts, analyze freethinkers' organizations, projects, networks, and contributions to forming a secular worldview, in particular, the promotion of concrete undertakings such as civil baptism or initiatives to leave church. Next to this secularist agenda, the contributions also take into account ambivalences and difficulties freethinkers were faced with, namely, the tensions between a national self-image and the transnational direction the movement has taken; the regional base of many projects and their transregional horizon; freethinkers' cultural programs and their immanent political mission; and the dialogue with respectively the conceptual distinction from other secularist groups. Readers interested in the history of secularity will learn that it was a heterogeneous enterprise already in its beginnings.

Whereas responsibility is generally delegated by the boss, the organization, or by virtue of position, accountability is having an intrinsic sense of ownership of the task and the willingness to face the consequences that come with success or failure. Through this guidebook you will learn how your organization and its leaders can create a culture that fosters accountability by focusing on five areas: support, freedom, information, resources, and goal and role clarity.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9783110796896","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Exiting Violence","authors":["Debora Tonelli","Gerard J.

Will you put yourself on the line?\n\nTo lead is to live dangerously. It's romantic and exciting to think of leadership as all inspiration, decisive action, and rich rewards, but leading requires taking risks that can jeopardize your career and your personal life. It requires putting yourself on the line, disrupting the status quo, and surfacing hidden conflict. And when people resist and push back, there's a strong temptation to play it safe. Those who choose to lead plunge in, take the risks, and sometimes get burned. But it doesn't have to be that way say renowned leadership experts Ronald Heifetz and Marty Linsky. In Leadership on the Line, they show how it's possible to make a difference without getting \"taken out\" or pushed aside. They present everyday tools that give equal weight to the dangerous work of leading change and the critical importance of personal survival. Through vivid stories from all walks of life, the authors present straightforward strategies for navigating the perilous straits of leadership.

Research on markers is central to comprehensive theories of the synchronic linguistic system as such, of the use of language in communication, and of language change. From the very beginning, linguists working on Romance languages have been at the forefront of research on discourse markers. Including among its contributors many of the foremost experts in the field, this volume not only offers substantial state-of-the-art introductions to the diverse facets of contemporary research on discourse markers, with a focus on Romance, but it achieves added value by including in each chapter original and previously unpublished results.\n\nThe first part of the book addresses foundational issues: What are discourse markers? What is their relationship to other types of pragmatic markers? The second part considers discourse markers at different levels of linguistic description, in particular: their grammatical status, their semantics and pragmatics, their prosodic features, their positioning within discourse units. The third part outlines different approaches to the study of discourse markers, namely contrastive studies, corpus linguistics, discourse traditions, and historical linguistics. The fourth part explores discourse markers at the interface with central topics in linguistics, such as politeness, social variation, language acquisition and psycholinguistic processing. The final part focuses on discourse markers in each of the major Romance languages, namely French, Italian, Spanish, Catalan, Portuguese and Romanian.\n\nThe volume will be of interest to researchers and students working in the field of Romance studies, general linguists, pragmaticians, discourse analysts, educationalists, and psychologists.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","Linguistics"]},{"id":"9781604912753","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Leadership in Action: Lending an Ear: Why Leaders Must Learn to Listen Actively","authors":["Michael H.

The Altruistic Brain and Born to Be Good show that humans are deeply wired for empathy and compassion. The Social Animal and Emotional Intelligence prove that our emotional selves help us make better decisions and motivate others. However, the tactics we use to train leaders bear little reflection of these advancements; we're still creating competent but emotionally distant leaders who “manage human assets” and lead by setting goals, deadlines, and deliverables.Zina Sutch and Patrick Malone hope to flip a light switch and illuminate, above all else, that leadership begins with heart and soul. In five succinct chapters, they show that we lead best when we tap into our genetically driven human nature to love and nurture, connect and trust.

It is the result of fieldwork done over a period of more than a decade among the Ho, an indigenous community of approximately one million people, who have shared cultural norms and the space of the hilly region of the Chota Nagpur Plateau with other aboriginal (adivasi) and artisan communities for ages. The book explores the structured tapestry of Ho people’s relations and interrelatedness within their culture-specific sociocosmic universe ensuring their social reproduction in the present and affording them the means for and the awareness of living in a world of plenty. This world of abundance – with the Ho as its conceptual centre – includes the Ho’s dead, their complex spirit world and supreme deity, and their tribal and nontribal fellow humans, and it manifests itself in manifold facets of their lives: socially, ritually, economically, and linguistically.\n\n\"This is an important piece of work.

It brings together contributions from different disciplines, as well as various forms of regional and historical expertise, which are indispensable in forming a globally oriented sociological perspective today.\n\nSecularization is understood as a process of boundary demarcation, that is, as the enactment of semantic, practical, and institutional distinctions between religion and other spheres of activity and knowledge. These distinctions may emerge from within the religious field itself, or may be absorbed into the field having originally emerged elsewhere. They may even be directly imposed upon religion by external forces. The volume is therefore based on the premise that societal differentiation – and secularity as a specific expression of it – is a widespread structural feature that nonetheless takes on various forms, depending on its historical and cultural context. In order to make this diversity visible, the volume adopts a global comparative perspective, and examines historical distinctions and differentiations in the West and beyond. By examining different forms and modes of secularity in statu nascendi, the volume contributes to developing a better understanding of the diversity of secularities, even of those found in the present day, in terms of their historicity and their specific path dependencies.\n\nWith this shift in perspective, this special volume initiates a global and historical turn in the theory of differentiation, as well as in the study of secularity.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","History"]},{"id":"9781119566243","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Intelligent Leader","authors":["John Mattone"],"pages":"208","publication_date":"October 2019","description":"Grow Your Leadership.

PalmPilot: The Ultimate Guide was an instant classic when it debuted in 1998, becoming, and remaining, the bestselling Palm book (and a top ten title among all computer books) every month since. Dense with previously undocumented information, this newly updated bible for Palm users delivers hundreds of timesaving tips and surprising tricks, plus a CD-ROM containing over 3,100 Palm programs. The second edition offers exclusive insider coverage of all models, including 1999's Palm IIIx, Palm V, laser-equipped Symbol 1500, and the revolutionary, wireless Palm VII. The book is divided into five sections:\n\nSection One details every hardware and software aspect of PalmPilot as it comes out of the box: the stylus and screen, the buttons, and the current line of models. A tutorial takes the reader through the palmtop's preferences and settings panels, teaches the Graffiti alphabet, and unearths surprising features of the machine's eight built-in programs.\n\nSection Two explains step-by-step how your PalmPilot can work with your PC: how data gets from your palmtop to your desktop computer and back again (HotSyncing). New chapters give special coverage to the separate Windows and Macintosh (Mac Pac 2.0) versions of Palm Desktop, which duplicates the functions of the PalmPilot (calendar, phone book, to-do list, memo pad, email, and expense tracking) on the desktop machine.\n\nSection Three takes the reader beyond the built-in Palm software to the best of the add-on programs included with the book. They include such graphics programs as DinkyPad, TealPaint, and the amazing ImageViewer (which unlocks the \"black-and-white\" Pilot screen's grayscale features); electronic books in Doc format; and music programs that use the hand-held's built-in speaker. New in this edition: how-to advice for using PalmPilot database programs to collect data in the field, and syncing them with such popular PC programs as FileMaker and Microsoft Access.\n\nSection Four covers the new Palm VII, the first one-piece, pocket-sized, wireless Internet device ever marketed, offering cell-network-based email and Web access anywhere in the country. As this section makes clear, any PalmPilot model can access the Net when equipped with the tiny PalmPilot modem. Such an arrangement is ideal for reading and replying to email--a great time-shifter for anyone who'd otherwise consider plane, train, or automobile time as downtime. Additional chapters cover the five Palm Web browsers, paging, faxing, and infrared beaming features.\n\nSection Five explains simple ways to troubleshoot both software and hardware, including HotSync snafus and various software glitches. Special chapters cover Palm fans' options for upgrading and accessorizing their palmtops. Two new appendixes debut in this edition; one explains how to write Palm VII Web-querying applets; the other, for the first time, covers the PalmPilot's synergy with Unix and Linux machines.\n\nPalmPilot: The Ultimate Guide, 2nd Edition is the most comprehensive Palm-platform book yet written. With the cooperation of Palm Computing, and 3Com, bestselling computer-book author David Pogue succinctly answers every conceivable question, unlocks Palm features most users never suspected, and radiates the fun, passion, and sense of community shared by Piloteers the world over. The enclosed CD-ROM (for Windows 9x, NT, and the Macintosh) is a disc-based version of the #1 Palm-software Web site, palmcentral.com, offering over 3,100 programs organized in a searchable, sortable database catalog with auto-install features and web links. PalmPilot: The Ultimate Guide is the essential guide for the PalmPilot owner.","tags":["Business","Business / Personal Technology","Personal Devices","Mobile Devices / Computers","Palm"]},{"id":"9788177587951","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"The Second Bush Presidency","authors":["Observer Foundation Observer Research Foundation"],"pages":"224","publication_date":"October 2006","description":"The Second Bush Presidency: Global Perspectives contains nine national perspectives on what a second Bush term portends for the world.

You feel energized and vibrantly alive. Your brain is buzzing with ideas, and the people around you share your joy and excitement. Things you've always known become clearer, adding value becomes more possible. Ideas and insights from others miraculously combine with your own to create new thinking and innovation. When Hot Spots arise in and between companies, they provide energy for exploiting and applying knowledge that is already known and genuinely exploring what was previously unknown. Hot Spots are marvelous creators of value for organizations and wonderful, life-enhancing phenomena for each of us. Lynda Gratton has spent more than ten years investigating Hot Spots—discovering how they emerge and how organizations can create environments where they will proliferate and thrive. She has studied dozens of companies and talked to hundreds of employees, managers, and executives in the US, Europe, and Asia. She has asked the important questions: Why and when do Hot Spots emerge? What is it about certain groups of people that support the emergence of Hot Spots? What role do leaders play? She's discovered a host of elements that together contribute to the emergence of Hot Spots—creating energy and excitement, and supporting and channeling that energy into productive outcomes. In this groundbreaking book, Gratton describes four crucial qualities that an organizational culture must have to support the emergence of Hot Spots, looks at what leaders can do to encourage them, and offers activities and tools you can use in your own company to increase the probability of them arising. In these days when traditional organizational boundaries are becoming barriers to progress, Gratton offers advice and guidance that you can use right now to increase the probability of Hot Spots emerging in your organization.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9780071802611","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Warrior’s Character: Leadership Wisdom From West Point’s Cadet Prayer","authors":["Don Snider"],"pages":"224","publication_date":"November 2012","description":"Lead your people to excellence using the time-honored values of one of America's most successful institutions\n\nAs one of America's most honored institutions, West Point has produced some of the greatest leaders in the history of the nation--and the world. For almost a century, West Point's men and women have been both informed and inspired by the \"Cadet Prayer\"--a simple but profound set of moral precepts for those who aspire to realize in their lives and work as leaders the ideals and principles of West Point.\n\nImagine if business had a similar compass for leadership . . .\n\nUsing the \"Cadet Prayer\" and the Academy's developmental model as a foundation, U.S. Army veteran and West Point professor Don M. Snider and his colleagues lay the groundwork for achieving leadership success in any business. Snider's assertion is this: In leadership, moral character comes first. Without it, skills, competence, and even vision are useless. Here are just a few of the leadership axioms from the \"Cadet Prayer\":\n\nStrengthen and increase our admiration for honest dealing and clean thinking\nMake us to choose the harder right instead of the easier wrong\nEndow us with courage that is born of loyalty to all that is noble and worthy\nGuard us against flippancy and irreverence in the sacred things of life\nGrant us new ties of friendship and new opportunities of service\n\nHonesty. Transparency. Loyalty. Service. These aren't \"soft\" traits. The're the nuts and bolts of quality leadership. They're the hallmark of authentic leadership for the sake of it. And they are the rock-solid foundation on which stand leadership success and all that comes with it.\n\n\"In leadership,\" Snider writes, \"being precedes doing.\" This timeless truth is the first step toward leadership excellence in any walk of life. The Warrior's Character will take you the rest of the way.\n\nWest Point's nondenominational \"Cadet Prayer\" has instilled the values of moral leadership in its cadets for nearly 100 years. In The Warrior's Character, Retired U.S. Army Colonel Don Snider and his colleagues provide a look into West Point’s development of leaders of character through the moral precepts found in the prayer and the Army's seven primary, timeless values:\n\nLOYALTY * DUTY * RESPECT * SERVICE * HONOR * INTEGRITY * COURAGE\n\nAll added up, they form the foundation on which great leadership is built—in the military, in business, in life. The Warrior's Character provides the inspiration and knowledge you need to become the best leader possible.

Though often well intentioned, these approaches generally resolve in an injunction to \"move on,\" as it were; to leave the painful past behind in the name of a conciliatory future. Through collective acts of apology and forgiveness, so the argument goes, reparation and restoration are imparted, and the writhing conflict of the past is substituted for by the overlapping consensus of community. And yet all too often, the authors of this study maintain, the work done in assuaging past discord serves to further debase and politically neutralize especially the victims of abuse in need of reconciliation and repair in the first place.\n\nDrawing on a wide range of case studies, from South Africa to Northern Ireland, Bosnia, Rwanda and Australia, the authors argue for an alternative approach to post-conflict thought. In so doing, they find inspiration in the vision of politics rendered by new pluralist, new realist, and especially agonistic political theory.\n\nFeaturing contributions from both up and coming and well-established scholars this work is essential reading for all those with an interest in restorative justice, conflict resolution and peace studies.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences"]},{"id":"9780133371802","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Understanding and Working with the Veteran Student: A Guide for Educators","authors":["Bret A.

Even worse, Washington policymakers seem out of ideas.\n\nWhere the Jobs Are: Entrepreneurship and the Soul of the American Economy shows how America can restore its great job-creation machine.\n\nRecent research has demonstrated that virtually all net new job creation in the United States over the past thirty years has come from businesses less than a year old—true \"start-ups.\" Start-up businesses create an average of three million new jobs each year, while existing businesses of any size or age shed a net average of about one million jobs annually.\n\nUnfortunately, the vital signs of America's job-creating entrepreneurial economy are flashing red alert. After remaining remarkably consistent for decades, the rate of new business formation has declined significant in recent years, and the number of new jobs created by new firms is also falling.\n\nIn Where the Jobs Are, the authors recount the findings of a remarkable summer they spent traveling the country to meet and conduct roundtables with entrepreneurs in a dozen cities. More than 200 entrepreneurs participated—explaining in specific and vividly personal terms the issues, frustrations, and obstacles that are undermining their efforts to launch new businesses, expand existing young firms, and create jobs. Those obstacles include a dangerously underperforming education system, self-defeating immigration policies that thwart the attraction and retention of the world's best talent, access to capital difficulties, a mounting regulatory burden, unnecessary tax complexity, and severe Washington-produced economic uncertainty.\n\nExplains how start-ups are different from existing businesses, large or small, and why they represent the engine of job creation\n\nReveals how policymakers' failure to understand the unique nature and needs of start-ups has undermined efforts to stimulate the economy following the Great Recession\n\nPresents a detailed, innovative, and uniquely credible 30-point policy agenda based on what America's job creators said they urgently need\n\nEngaging and informative, Where the Jobs Are reveals with unprecedented precision and clarity the major obstacles undermining the fragile economic recovery, and provides a vitally important game plan to unleash the job-creating capacity of the entrepreneurial economy and put a beleaguered nation back to work.","tags":["Other","Politics & Global Issues"]},{"id":"9780132619356","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Fixing the Housing Market: Financial Innovations for the Future","authors":["Glenn R.

Today is no different: in fact, responsible financial innovation is now the best tool available for \"rebooting\" crippled housing markets, improving their efficiency, and making housing more accessible to millions. In Fixing the Housing Market, three leading experts explain how, covering everything decision-makers should know about today’s housing and financial markets.\n\nThe authors first explain how innovative housing financial products, services and institutions evolved through the 19th century, World War I, the Great Depression, World War II, and beyond -- culminating in the post-1970s era of securitization. Next, they assess housing finance systems in mature economies during and after the recent crisis, highlighting benefits and risks associated with each widely-used mortgage funding structure and product. They also carefully assess current housing finance structures in emerging economies such as Brazil, Russia, India, and China.\n\nBuilding on these insights, the authors introduce transformative financial innovations that can facilitate a more stable and sustainable financing system for housing -- providing better shelter for more people, helping the industry recover, and creating thousands of new jobs. Using these new tools, entrepreneurs, economic development specialists, and policymakers can develop practical strategies for bridging funding gaps -- raising more capital for longer terms at lower cost.","tags":["Other","Real Estate"]},{"id":"9781625271327","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Return on Character","authors":["Fred Kiel"],"pages":"272","publication_date":"March 2015","description":"Does the character of our leaders matter?You may think this question was answered long ago. Countless business authors and analysts have assured us that great leadership demands great character. Time and again, we’ve seen that truth play out, as once-thriving organizations falter and fail under the guidance of leaders behaving badly. Why, then, do so many executives remain skeptical about the true value of leadership character? A winning strategy and a sound business model are what really matter, they argue; character is just the icing on the cake.What’s been missing from this debate is hard evidence: data that shows not only that leadership character matters for organizational success, but how it matters; and concrete evidence that it leads to better business results. Now, in this groundbreaking book, respected leadership researcher, adviser, and author Fred Kiel offers that evidencesolid data that demonstrates the connection between character, leadership excellence, and organizational results.After seven years of rigorous research based on a landmark study of more than 100 CEOs and over 8,000 of their employees’ observations, Kiel’s findings show that leaders of strong character achieved up to five times the ROA for their organizations as did leaders of weak character.Return on Character goes on to reveal: How leadership character is formed, how it creates value, and how that value spreads throughout the organization How low-character leaders undermine the success of even the best business plans How leaders at any level can develop the habits of strong character and unlearn” the habits of poor characterThe book also provides a character-building methodologystep-by-step advice and techniques for assessing your own character habits and improving your performance and that of your organization.Return on Character provides the blueprint for building your own leadership character and creating a character-driven organization that achieves superior business results.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781000366587","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Gear-Shifting Leadership","authors":["Leon Cai"],"pages":"200","publication_date":"March 2021","description":"Drawn from his experience as the executive dean of Wilner Sales and Leadership Institute, Leon Cai shares his proven philosophy and methods for improving leadership skills among middle and high-level managers.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9780071816953","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Infiltrated: How to Stop the Insiders and Activists Who Are Exploiting the Financial Crisis to Control Our Lives and Our Fortunes","authors":["Jay W.

A new wave of financial reformers has infiltrated our public institutions at both the state and national levels. A growing army of self-proclaimed activists, philanthropists, and politicians has infiltrated not only the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, but the FDIC, the Treasury, and other regulatory agencies. This explosive new book from New York Times bestselling author Jay W. Richards reveals the shocking truth about:\n\nThe latest financial regulations—what every consumer and businessperson needs to know\nThe Dodd-Frank Reform Act—how it targets the wrong people and problems\nElizabeth Warren and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau—what they’re really up to\nConsumer credit and debt—why we need to stop blaming the banks\nThe war against free enterprise—what you can do to fight back\n\nThis startling account walks you through America’s government and financial industry from the inside out—exposing the surprising history, the colorful characters, and the earthshaking events that got us where we are today.\n\nYou’ll meet the political ideologues and extremists whose good intentions paved the road to financial hell. You’ll witness the “blame game” in action, as politicians and the media use the 2008 meltdown as an excuse to further their own agendas. You’ll learn about the terrible consequences that sweeping government reforms have on small businesses and other industries that had nothing to do with the financial crisis.\n\nFinally, you’ll find a special resource section of positive actions and ideas to help you stand up and speak out for your rights.\n\nAmerica is at a crossroads. It is time for us to choose between stricter government control that limits our freedom or a more open free market that is the key to prosperity. This book could make all the difference.\n\nFREE ENTERPRISE IS UNDER ATTACK. THIS BOOK IS AMERICA’S WAKE-UP CALL.\n\n“Big government statists have created a destructive myth that deregulation and greed caused the financial crisis. Richards demonstrates that altruistic government policies supported by crony socialists were the primary cause of the crisis. It is important to debunk the statist myth, because it has been the justification for extremely harmful public policies.”John Allison, President and CEO, Cato Institute, and New York Times bestselling author of The Financial Crisis and the Free Market Cure\n\n“Infiltrated strips the pretense of compassion from ‘community action’ and rips away the patina of idealism from housing ‘fairness’ hustles. . . . While naming the names and crimes of housing ‘charity’ scammers, Richards expounds an inspiring liberation philosophy of true economic compassion and win-win economic growth for all.”George Gilder, author of Knowledge and Power\n\n“Fearless and brilliant. Dr. Richards boldly addresses important consumer lending issues in a detailed and exhaustive manner. You may not like his conclusions, but to detractors I say prove him wrong. The absolute best book of its kind.”Harold A. Black, PhD, Smith Professor of Finance (Emeritus), University of Tennessee\n\n“If you want to know why the popular wisdom about the causes and effects of the financial crisis is mostly wrong, and how such myths will help facilitate similar crises in the future, Jay Richards’s Infiltrated is an eye-opener.”Samuel Gregg, author of Becoming Europe","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","Political Science"]},{"id":"9781420074185","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Leadership in Chaordic Organizations","authors":["Beverly G.

Why is that?\n\nThis conundrum becomes acute as businesses embark on digital transformations, an often-painful venture highlighting the deficiencies of traditional management styles but also agile methodologies. They deliver results that are far below initial expectations, provide half-baked digital solutions where potential commercial gains are poorly captured and leveraged, and, far too often, not even identified.\n\nMismatches between technologies, the man-machine (dis)connect, or organizational dysfunctionality are typically identified as root causes, but beneath them lurks a more scathing problem: an inadequate leadership. This inadequacy rests on a lack of holistic insights backed by well-rounded skills and sets of knowledge that are required to understand all aspects of a digital transformation, as well as its participants from employees to customers.\n\nThus, what is needed is a modern take of the Renaissance Man.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781501506697","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Staging Language","authors":["Urszula Clark"],"pages":"188","publication_date":"January 2019","description":"Although there are many studies on linguistic variation as it relates to both \"traditional\" and \"new\" media such as film, TV, newspapers, and online behavior, little has been written about spoken performance in overt but face-to-face conversations.

The book draws upon a substantial amount of empirical data in its investigation of the role played by performance texts in creating, maintaining and challenging imagined communities and focuses upon the ways in which performance contributes to people's sense of the kinds of use for which dialect/variational use is appropriate and those for which it is not.

The rules and norms have changed—and so must leadership.\n\nAnd yet, coercive bureaucracy, hierarchy, and control—old ways of thinking and working—are still with us, a deep-seated and powerful legacy. We are living through a profound transition from an old, industrial era to a new one that is digital, transparent, and complex.\n\nIn this important new book by former dean of Harvard Business School Kim Clark, written with his business school professor son, Jonathan, and management consultant daughter, Erin, the dynamic struggle between two competing paradigms of leadership is compellingly illustrated: an old paradigm that involves control and power over people versus a new one that enables and inspires power through people.\n\nWith rich examples and stories, the authors show how deeply ingrained the legacy model of leadership remains and how destructive it is, causing waste and loss of human potential, stifling innovation, and ultimately resulting in what the authors call \"organizational darkness.\" They go on to articulate a new, positive model, one that consciously seeks to do good and to make things better; that cares for people, helping them to thrive; and that mobilizes people to solve tough problems. These three elements, they argue, are the soul, heart, and mind of leadership, and activating them requires careful attention to both the personal and the organizational dimensions of leadership.\n\nThe narrative is interwoven with probing analysis and reflection, and the authors speak clearly and frankly about the moral aspects and impact of leadership. They also provide a concrete frame and approach for scaling the new model and creating a vibrant leadership system.\n\nLeading Through is a deep and essential account of the evolution of our leadership thinking and practice that is both timely and timeless.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781604914368","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Leadership in Action: Dividends and interest - Trust Me, It's the One Thing a Leaders Should Never Lose","authors":["Craig Chappelow"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"August 2001","description":"What exactly is a betrayal of trust, and what makes it so unforgivable?","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781422197493","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"HBR Guide to Getting the Mentoring You Need (HBR Guide Series)","authors":["Harvard Business Review"],"pages":"176","publication_date":"December 2013","description":"Find the right person to help supercharge your career.\n\nWhether you’re eyeing a specific leadership role, hoping to advance your skills, or simply looking to broaden your professional network, you need to find someone who can help.

Many of these patterns include the use of linguistic resources from multiple languages in the same utterance. Translanguaging, a recent theoretical framework, is gaining prominence among scholars interested in studying these multilingual discursive practices and the concept of a unitary language system for lexical processing.\n\nThe aim of this book is to gain a better understanding of the bilingual brain and how words and sentences that use features from socially distinct languages are processed. Using examples provided by multilingual study participants, a categorization of the various forms of translanguaging is developed to build a translanguaging model. Psycholinguistic methods such as eye tracking are combined with conventional sociolinguistic survey methodology to provide rich qualitative and quantitative data that address the cognitive effects of translanguaging and the underlying structure of translingual word-formations.\n\nThis monograph shows how language biography, exposure, and attitude towards multilingual discursive practices all affect cognitive processing. It also demonstrates how multilingual speakers are setting the patterns for novel word-formations to be produced, thus having a social, cultural, and cognitive impact on how we communicate.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","Linguistics"]},{"id":"9783111062853","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Democratizing the State","authors":["Ernesto Isunza Vera","Adrian Gurza Lavalle"],"pages":"168","publication_date":"November 2024","description":"Democratic institution-building experiences, innovative forms of social organization, and the development of multiple state-society interfaces represent a significant political phenomenon in Latin America in the last half-century.

Palm Programming should be eagerly accepted by programmers because the authors worked closely with Palm to ensure that the book is tailored exactly to the needs of the ever-growing group of Palm developers. As nothing but some piecemeal documentation exists currently, this book provides a much needed solution to the Palm developers. In fact, Palm uses this book as their official developer's guide and will be using it in the future as a key part of their training materials for developers. There are currently no books on Palm programming (and we know of none that are planned). The only way to learn is by using the reference material published by Palm (available freely on their Web site), the tutorial they provide, or various Palm programming FAQs compiled by third parties. Palm Programming shows intermediate to experienced C programmers how to build a Palm application from the ground up. Using an easy-to- understand tutorial approach, this book gives readers everything necessary to create a wide range of Palm applications and conduits, from simple scripts through full-blown applications, and in the process provides thorough coverage of Palm programming. It includes a CD-ROM (Macintosh and Windows compatible) with the full source code to the examples in the book, a trial version of Palm's Software Development Kit, and third-party developer tools, including Metrowerks' CodeWarrior Lite programming kit.

The key contribution of this book is to bring together the different approaches with an account that is grounded in sociological and philosophical analysis as opposed to visions of the future that are inspired by extreme visions of catastrophe or approaches that see the future as only the continuation of the present. Given a revival of apocalyptical visions of the ‘end times’ and dystopian views of the future of human societies, there is urgent need for a new approach on how we should imagine the future. The author explores the future as a field of tensions that is revealed in narratives, utopian desires, hope, imaginaries, and social struggles concerning the potential possibilities of the present: the future does not just arrive; it has to be fought for.\n\nThis book is an important contribution to a critical sociology of the future.

McGowan","Chris Shipley","Thomas L. Friedman"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"April 2020","description":"A guide for individuals and organizations navigating the complex and ambiguous Future of Work\n\nForeword by New York Times columnist and best-selling author Thomas L. Friedman\n\nTechnology is changing work as we know it. Cultural norms are undergoing tectonic shifts. A global pandemic proves that we are inextricably connected whether we choose to be or not. So much change, so quickly, is disorienting. It's undermining our sense of identity and challenging our ability to adapt. But where so many see these changes as threatening, Heather McGowan and Chris Shipley see the opportunity to open the flood gates of human potential—if we can change the way we think about work and leadership. They have dedicated the last 5 years to understanding how technical, business, and cultural shifts affecting the workplace have brought us to this crossroads, The result is a powerful and practical guide to the future of work for leaders and employees. The future can be better, but only if we let go of our attachment to our traditional (and disappearing) ideas about careers, and what a \"good job\" looks like.\n\nBlending wisdom from interviews with hundreds of executives, The Adaptation Advantage explains the profound changes happening in the world of work and posits the solution: new ways to think about careers that detach our sense of pride and personal identity from our job title, and connect it to our sense of purpose. Activating purpose, the authors suggest, will inherently motivate learning, engagement, empowerment, and lead to new forms of pride and identity throughout the workforce. Only when we let go of our rigid career identities can we embrace and appreciate the joys of learning and adapting to new realities—and help our organizations do the same.\n\nOf course, making this transition is hard. It requires leaders who can attract and motivate cognitively diverse teams fueled by a strong sense of purpose in an environment of psychological safety—despite fierce competition and external pressures.   Adapting to the future of work has always called for strong leadership. Now, as a pandemic disrupts so many aspects of work, adapting is a leadership imperative. The Adaptation Advantage is an essential guide to help leaders meet that challenge.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781119954132","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Growth Champions: The Battle for Sustained Innovation Leadership","authors":["The Growth Agenda"],"pages":"344","publication_date":"April 2012","description":"Unique insights and fresh perspectives on business growth and innovation\n\nGrowth is a priority for most businesses, but one that's elusive and difficult to achieve.

It has the ability to make us feel at home in the world or alien from it; connected or disconnected. Both large and small scale in cities can be beautiful; both are right, neither is wrong. Whilst accepting that prescription is no answer, 'getting the scale right' - at an intuitive and sensual level - is a fundamental part of the magic of architecture and urban design. Touching the City explores how scale is manifested in cities, exploring scale in buildings, in the space between them and in their details. It asks how scale makes a difference.\n\nTravelling from Detroit to Chandigarh, via New York, London, Paris, Rome and Doha, Tim Makower explores cities with the analytical eye of a designer and with the experiential eye of the urban dweller. Looking at historic cities, he asks what is good about them: what can we learn from the old to inform the new? The book zooms in from the macro scale of surfing Google Earth to micro moments such as finding fossils in a weathered wall. It examines the dynamics and movement patterns of cities, the making of streets and skylines, the formation of thresholds and facades, and it also touches on the process of design and the importance of drawing. As the book's title, Touching the City, suggests, it also emphasises the tactile - that the city is indeed something physical, something we can touch and be touched by, alive and ever changing.","tags":["Other"]},{"id":"01520110040SI","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Feeling Your Way: Enhancing Leadership Through Intuition","authors":["Talula Cartwright"],"pages":"7","publication_date":"January 2004","description":"Leaders often have to make decisions without access to complete and certain information.

It illustrates how teachers can both lift people up and let them down. It proposes that the best teachers are also leaders, and the best leaders are also teachers.\n\nIn examining how to lead and teach, renowned Harvard Business School professor Thomas J. DeLong takes the reader inside his own head and heart. He notes that, as teachers, we often focus more on our inadequacies and missteps than on our strengths and unique talents. He explains why this is so by dissecting and analyzing his own experiences--using himself as a case study.\n\nThe book's goal is to help readers learn about the intricacies of teaching and managing, and to impart lessons about how teachers can create a unique teaching atmosphere. To do this, the author analyzes the process of creating a curriculum, preparing for an eighty-minute class, managing the fifteen minutes before class begins, and evaluating the nature of the teaching experience after the session concludes.\n\nAlong the way, he connects specific classroom behaviors with leadership issues--in organizations, in teams, and in personal relationships. He also asks--and answers--some provocative questions, such as:\n\nWhat happens on multiple levels when I teach or lead--with me, students, or professionals?\nWhat am I thinking and feeling as I process what students are thinking and feeling?\nHow are my internal conversations affecting how I teach and lead?\nHow do I manage my biases, including having \"favorite\" students?\nTo what extent can I use teaching methods in the arena of management?\n\nThroughout Teaching by Heart, DeLong discusses why empathy and authenticity matter. When teachers embrace this mindset, students have the opportunity to have a unique learning experience. Teachers and managers will learn how to create moments of transformation for students.\n\nWhether you're a university professor, a student, a business leader, or just someone fascinated by teaching, this book will instruct, entertain, and--hopefully--inspire.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781949443653","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Our Glassrooms","authors":["Dhruva Trivedy"],"pages":"158","publication_date":"December 2018","description":"This book highlights the significance of perceptiveness that takes readers to formidable heights, showing relevance in most revered professions and in the corporate world.\n\nWe have had various leadership attributes discussed globally, but the attribute of perceptiveness has been overlooked, particularly, in the context of transformational leadership.

But markets still run on old textbook models that ignore social and environmental costs-leading to a new kind of warfare: global economic warfare.Building a Win-Win World demonstrates how the global economy is unsustainable because of its negative effects on employees, families, communities, and the ecosystem. Henderson shows that win-win strategies can become the norm at every level when people see the true current and future costs of short-sighted, narrow economic policies.Henderson shows how humans are encountering the endgames of the competition/conflict paradigm, and identifies the signs of transition. Using warfare as a metaphor for the dark side of today's world economic system, she shows how both are destructive, inhumane, wasteful, irrational, inefficient, competitive, and crisis-driven. Both create more new problems than they solve. She describes how the globalization of the war system, technology, and industrialization brought the Cold War to a dead end. By the mid-1980s the global warfare paradigm had given ground to a global economic warfare which many economists, politicians, and business leaders hailed as a victory of capitalism and competitive \"free markets.\" Yet this new type of warfare proved little better than the military warfare it was advertised to replace. By the mid-1990s global economic warfare had already reached crisis points of its own.Building a Win-Win World examines how jobs, education, health care, human rights, democratic participation, socially responsible business, and environmental protection are all sacrificed to \"global competitiveness.\" Henderson shows many ways out of the dilemmas faced by all countries. New agreements are described to tame the global economic casino, regulate multi-national corporations, and levy fees for commercial use of global common resources-oceans, atmosphere, space, etc.-and tax their abuse. These revenues can then be invested in civilian needs and sectors worldwide. She also describes a trend toward \"grassroots globalism\"-citizens movements that are addressing poverty, social inequities, pollution, resource-depletion, violence, and wars. Grassroots globalism, she says, is about thinking and acting-globally and locally. It is pragmatic problem-solving, implementing local solutions that keep the planet in mind. Such social innovations can raise the ethical floor under the global playing field so that the most ethical companies and countries can win.","tags":["Other","Politics & Global Issues"]},{"id":"9780415838962","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"China Turned On","authors":["James Lull"],"pages":"244","publication_date":"June 2013","description":"The years following the Cultural Revolution saw the arrival of television as part of China’s effort to ‘modernize’ and open up to the West. Endorsed by the Deng Xiaoping regime as a ‘bridge’ between government and the people, television became at once the official mouthpiece of the Communist Party and the most popular form of entertainment for Chinese people living in the cities. But the authorities failed to realize the unmatched cultural power of television to inspire resistance to official ideologies, expectations, and lifestyles.\n\nThe presence of television in the homes of the urban Chinese strikingly broadened the cultural and political awareness of its audience and provoked the people to imagine better ways of living as individuals, families, and as a nation.\n\nOriginally published in 1991, set within the framework of China’s political and economic environment in the modernization period, this insightful analysis is based on ethnographic data collected in China before and after the Tiananmen Square disaster. From interviews with leading Chinese television executives and nearly one hundred families in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Xian, the author outlays how Chinese television fosters opposition to the government through the work routines of media professionals, television imagery, and the role of critical, active audience members.","tags":["Other","Politics & Global Issues"]},{"id":"9781637424124","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Emergency Management for Healthcare","authors":["Norman Ferrier"],"pages":"138","publication_date":"November 2022","description":"This series of books focuses on highly specialized Emergency Management arrangements for healthcare facilities and organizations.

Success is measured by what we accomplish together. Our obligation to the people we serve is too important to place politics and partisanship before progress and results.\"\n\nFor the Governor and his longtime associate Steve Kadish, these words are much more than political platitudes. They are at the heart of a method for delivering results—and getting past politics—the two developed while working together in top leadership positions in the public and private sectors.\n\nDistilled into a four-step framework, Results is the much-needed implementation guide for anyone in public service, as well as for leaders and managers in large organizations hamstrung by bureaucracy and politics. With a broad range of examples, Baker, a Republican, and Kadish, a Democrat, show how to move from identifying problems to achieving results in a way that bridges divides instead of exacerbating them. They show how government can be an engine of positive change and an example of effective operation, not just a hopeless bureaucracy.\n\nResults is not only about getting things done, but about renewing people's faith in public service. Empty promises feed disengagement when instead we need confidence in our government and the services it delivers. When a mob attacked the US Capitol Building on January 6, 2021, the very core of our democracy and our sense of government were threatened. Demonstrating that government can work—the goal of this book—is vital to ensuring the future of our democracy.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9783111211817","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Collective Memory as Currency","authors":["Tracy Adams"],"pages":"135","publication_date":"July 2024","description":"Why is the past so dominant in the present? This book conceptualizes collective memory as currency, a medium of exchange, a system in common use, and one that is traded between and within nations. Bringing together contemporary case studies and multidisciplinary scholarship, this volume shows how past events are used and perceived as a commodity and a substantially fungible marketable item produced to satisfy wants or needs, their supply or demand being a part of one universal market.\n\nThis book provides readers with a broader understanding of the power of the past in the present. Specific past events are incarnated into collective memories that can transform into iconic, almost mythical stories that can be employed to help make sense of the present. Through evoking, constructing and reconstructing, selectively highlighting certain aspects or perspectives of prominent past events, these collective memories become a significant resource that actors and publics turn to in times of need. As currency, these memories provide a service. As currency, they can also relatively easily travel between collectives, since it is commonly understood that the past has value in the present, and that this value is similarly utilized in various countries around the world.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","Political Science"]},{"id":"9780470829752","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"China Versus the West: The Global Power Shift of the 21st Century","authors":["Ivan Tselichtchev","Yang Yongxin","Frank-Jürgen Richter"],"pages":"224","publication_date":"March 2012","description":"China Versus the West is an innovative book.\n\nThe author, a leading specialist on the international and Asian economy and business, presents the most comprehensive picture of the changing power balance between the emerging superpower China and the \"old\" developed economies of the West: mainly the US, Europe and Japan. The reader can clearly see in what areas and to what extent China has become the world leader, in what areas it is catching up and in what areas the West retains its superiority and has a chance to strengthen it further.\n\nAt the same time, I. Tselichtchev unveils a breath-taking story of the global economy and business in the brave new world which is non-\"West-led\" and where major growth dynamics are coming from large emerging economies. A radically changing economic environment requires new government policies and business strategies. The book contains many valuable suggestions and ideas. Using his own analytical framework, the author presents a set of options and alternatives for Western businesses in the wake of China's production and export offensive.\n\nThe book provides a uniquely sharp and thought-provoking analysis of the factors behind the global crisis of 2008-2009, largely different from what we see in other publications, and examines its implications for the global power balance. I. Tselichtchev vividly shows that it was not global, but Western crisis of a structural character which drastically changed the China-West power balance in the former's favor. He provides strong arguments showing that today's China is structurally and macro-economically stronger than most countries of the West. This leads him to rethinking the very essence of the Chinese model of capitalism and to its new definition. He expresses unconventional, sometimes controversial, but well-founded views about China's problems and weaknesses and the prospects for its political evolution.\n\nThe book ends with invaluable insights into China's unique role in the world economic history, the essence of the non-\"West-led\" multipolar world and the positions of its major players. Arguing that from now on no single country will be ever able to \"rule the world\", it shows new opportunities dynamic China is opening for the West.\n\nThoroughly analyzing and discussing a wide range of the key, often complicated issues which are now in the focus of the world's attention, the book remains very reader-friendly. It is written in the form of an unconstrained dialogue with the reader, containing a lot of the author's on-the-spot impressions, interesting facts, remarks and quotations.\n\nChina Versus the West is a must reading for everyone who wants to know more about the global developments, China and the West, and also, perhaps, to get valuable inputs and hints to find his or her own place in today's new world. It is highly recommended for policy-makers, business people, academics, analysts and journalists.

Matveev"],"pages":"231","publication_date":"September 2017","description":"Pattern Recognition on Oriented Matroids covers a range of innovative problems in combinatorics, poset and graph theories, optimization, and number theory that constitute a far-reaching extension of the arsenal of committee methods in pattern recognition. The groundwork for the modern committee theory was laid in the mid-1960s, when it was shown that the familiar notion of solution to a feasible system of linear inequalities has ingenious analogues which can serve as collective solutions to infeasible systems. A hierarchy of dialects in the language of mathematics, for instance, open cones in the context of linear inequality systems, regions of hyperplane arrangements, and maximal covectors (or topes) of oriented matroids, provides an excellent opportunity to take a fresh look at the infeasible system of homogeneous strict linear inequalities – the standard working model for the contradictory two-class pattern recognition problem in its geometric setting. The universal language of oriented matroid theory considerably simplifies a structural and enumerative analysis of applied aspects of the infeasibility phenomenon.\n\nThe present book is devoted to several selected topics in the emerging theory of pattern recognition on oriented matroids: the questions of existence and applicability of matroidal generalizations of committee decision rules and related graph-theoretic constructions to oriented matroids with very weak restrictions on their structural properties; a study (in which, in particular, interesting subsequences of the Farey sequence appear naturally) of the hierarchy of the corresponding tope committees; a description of the three-tope committees that are the most attractive approximation to the notion of solution to an infeasible system of linear constraints; an application of convexity in oriented matroids as well as blocker constructions in combinatorial optimization and in poset theory to enumerative problems on tope committees; an attempt to clarify how elementary changes (one-element reorientations) in an oriented matroid affect the family of its tope committees; a discrete Fourier analysis of the important family of critical tope committees through rank and distance relations in the tope poset and the tope graph; the characterization of a key combinatorial role played by the symmetric cycles in hypercube graphs.\n\nContentsOriented Matroids, the Pattern Recognition Problem, and Tope CommitteesBoolean IntervalsDehn–Sommerville Type RelationsFarey SubsequencesBlocking Sets of Set Families, and Absolute Blocking Constructions in PosetsCommittees of Set Families, and Relative Blocking Constructions in PosetsLayers of Tope CommitteesThree-Tope CommitteesHalfspaces, Convex Sets, and Tope CommitteesTope Committees and Reorientations of Oriented MatroidsTopes and Critical CommitteesCritical Committees and Distance SignalsSymmetric Cycles in the Hypercube Graphs","tags":["Data","AI & ML","Machine Learning","Machine Learning Methods","Pattern Recognition"]},{"id":"9781604913972","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Leadership in Action: A Question of Leadership - What is the Best Way for Executives to Deal with Organizational Politics?","authors":["Elinor Johnson","Roger Conway"],"pages":"2","publication_date":"April 2002","description":"Every organization can benefit from creating supportive alliances and that executives must understand the desirability of such connections and be socially and politically savvy.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781430226413","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"The Definitive Guide to PC-BSD","authors":["Dru Lavigne"],"pages":"400","publication_date":"March 2010","description":"This book is the ultimate reference for both beginners and power users to PC-BSD—the free, easy-to-use operating system based on FreeBSD.

The main goal is to uncover a great mystery: why can we communicate effectively despite the fact that ambiguity is pervasive in the language that we use? And conversely, how do speakers and hearers use ambiguity and vagueness to achieve a specific goal? Comprehensive answers to these questions are provided from different fields which focus on the study of language, in particular, linguistics, literary criticism, rhetoric, psycholinguistics, theology, media studies and law. By bringing together these different disciplines, the book documents a radical change in the research on ambiguity. The innovation is brought about by the transdisciplinary perspective of the individual and co-authored papers that bridge the gaps between disciplines. The research program that underlies this volume establishes theoretical connections between the areas of (psycho)linguistics that concentrate on the question of how the system of language works with the areas of rhetoric, literary studies, theology and law that focus on the question of how communication works in discourse and text from the perspective of both production and perception. A three-dimensional Ambiguity Model is presented that serves as a theoretical anchor point for the analyses of the different types of ambiguities by the contributors of this volume. The Ambiguity Model is a hybrid model which brings together the different perspectives on how language and the language system work with respect to ambiguity as well as the question of how ambiguity is employed in communication and in different communicational settings. A set of specific features that are relevant for the description of ambiguity, such as whether the ambiguity arises in the production or perception process, and whether it occurs in strategic or nonstrategic communication, are defined. The research program rests on the assumption that both the production and the perception of ambiguity, as well as its strategic and nonstrategic occurrence, can only be understood by exploring how these factors interact with each other and a reference system when ambiguity is generated and resolved. The collection Ambiguity: Language and Communication constitutes a superb introduction to the workings of ambiguity in language and communication along with extensive analyses of many different examples from different fields. As such it is relevant for students of linguistics, literary studies, rhetoric, law and theology and at the same time there is sufficient quality analysis and new research questions to benefit advanced readers who are interested in ambiguity.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","Linguistics"]},{"id":"9780749474447","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Strength-Based Leadership Coaching in Organizations","authors":["Doug MacKie"],"pages":"216","publication_date":"March 2016","description":"Adopt positive organizational psychology approaches that focus on the best skills of your people to get results.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781398606272","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Develop Your Leadership Skills, 5th Edition","authors":["John Adair"],"pages":"112","publication_date":"July 2022","description":"Develop your leadership skills and find out how to become a leader people want to work with in this essential pocket guide by world leading leadership expert John Adair.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781847195982","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Mastering Oracle Scheduler in Oracle 11g Databases","authors":["Ronald Rood"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"June 2009","description":"In \"Mastering Oracle Scheduler in Oracle 11g Databases\", you will unlock the full potential of Oracle Scheduler (DBMS_SCHEDULER), a powerful tool for automating and managing database tasks.

But there has been little scholarly work on polarization as a communicative phenomenon since the late 1970s.\n\nAt the same time, holes remain in contemporary rhetorical theory regarding the concept of the orator.

ISIS members were captured and detained: men were sent to prison and women and children to camps in northern Syria. This is an unprecedented situation where for the first-time thousands of female members of a terrorist group are detained in a foreign country without access to legal mechanisms, rehabilitation or reintegration measures. What happens to the foreign women (and children) who are not repatriated from the camps? If they are repatriated, are there rehabilitation and reintegration programmes in place that account for the experiences the women had?\n\nMost existing rehabilitation and reintegration programmes are gender-neutral; that is, they claim to be universal, and are not tailored specifically to male or female beneficiaries. Yet, typically, these programmes are influenced by implicit gender norms and assumptions, such as that men are violent perpetrators of aggression and women are victims who are peaceful and lack agency. Alongside gender norms, intersecting racial and religious dynamics also shape how governments handle the repatriation, rehabilitation and reintegration of ISIS returnees. This includes racial profiling, the conflation between Islam and extremism and more broadly the rising Islamophobia in many countries, particularly since the ‘War on Terror’. These dynamics lead to an absence of rehabilitation and reintegration programmes specifically designed for women’s diverse experiences, which is the subject of this book.\n\nReturning Home examines state responses to repatriation, rehabilitation and reintegration of ISIS returnees from an intersectional perspective, with a focus on ISIS women returnees. This book addresses the biased understandings that are built into scholarship and policy responses that reinforce gendered and racialized inequalities. It outlines how these dynamics can be uncovered and redressed by designing policies that are responsive to gender differences, inequalities and harmful norms.\n\n.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","Political Science"]},{"id":"9781292166179","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Positive Leader, The","authors":["Jan Muhlfeit","Melina Costi"],"pages":"344","publication_date":"October 2016","description":"Discover how to banish stress and negativity, rediscover your best self and become an inspirational leader – starting now.

Did Americans truly want to “subvert” the Soviet regime with abstraction, and were the Soviets really “afraid” of non-figurative art? And, most noteworthy, can we adequately assess the role of art as a “weapon” of the Cold War? The significance of Shared Images lies in its revision of what, to date, has been a biased, politicized approach to American art and Soviet cultural policies during the Cold War. Shared Images proposes that we write Cold War art history without merely projecting political events onto the art historical timeline and interpolating the logic of Cold War politics into cultural history. Instead, the monograph presents a careful narrative which, along with major political events, also considers individual agencies, affective regimes, and, of course, formative contexts other than the political. Exploring American art as an essentially global phenomenon, the monograph employs the concept of a “shared history” to analyze interconnections and mutual dependence of Soviet and American art histories from the late 1940s to the 1960s. Shared Images, thus, revises narratives on Soviet and American isolationism, allegedly a distinctive feature of Cold War cultures.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","History"]},{"id":"9783111632230","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Papal Arts of Peace and Civilization","authors":["Maxim Baz"],"pages":"344","publication_date":"March 2025","description":"The twentieth century saw a transformation in the Catholic Church’s approach to war and peace, as the papacy sought to adopt and propose alternatives to traditional Just War doctrine by developing contemporary policies to peacefully resolve both the symptoms and root causes of war. This book explores the emergence of a new ethical framework, built upon three distinct moral doctrines, coined here as AMP: War Avoidance, for when war is imminent; War Mitigation, for when war is unavoidable; and Preventive Pacification, during periods of relative stability. This book examines the shaping of the AMP paradigm from Leo XIII to John Paul II, analyzing its theological, philosophical, and legal underpinnings. While AMP co-exists alongside Just War doctrine, the latter provides a framework for judging the morality of war, the former addresses the preemption, mitigation, and prevention of conflict. The book argues that AMP gradually became the primary framework for the Holy See’s foreign policy with the potential to further become a crucial ethical guide for the twenty-first century’s pursuit of more just and peaceful international relations.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","Political Science"]},{"id":"9781449310516","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Dancing Barefoot","authors":["Wil Wheaton"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"February 2004","description":"Wil Wheaton--blogger, geek, and Star Trek: The Next Generation's Wesley Crusher--gives us five short-but-true tales of life in the so-called Space Age in Dancing Barefoot.

These developments have brought us such advances as the Web, social networking, 24/7 connectivity, and global markets.\n\nBut the benefits of all this progress have not been shared fairly among all. It is true that the elites of Mumbai are closer today to the elites of Manhattan than they were two decades ago, but what about Kansas? The hard-working salarymen of the developed world are not getting wealthier, but the economic elites who have mastered the new rules of global innovation are. Even as rural women in Africa and Asia have seen their lives transformed by mobile phones and the Internet, the middle classes and blue-collar workers in prosperous countries everywhere have been squeezed by the new global realities. And as the first phase of the innovation revolution gives way to a much greater transformation, America and other rich societies must find a path to inclusive growth or else risk being left behind by history.\n\nAll this leads to the central political and economic question of our age: How can the extraordinary benefits of the innovation revolution be shared more equitably among all of society? In Need, Speed, and Greed, global correspondent for the Economist Vijay V. Vaitheeswaran answers that question, offering the essential insider’s guide to this new world of innovation. Drawing on the best of the academic and field work in this emerging area, Need, Speed, and Greed inspires and empowers readers to improve their lives, their work, and perhaps even the world.","tags":["Other","Politics & Global Issues"]},{"id":"9780071496612","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Oracle Database 11g New Features","authors":["Robert Freeman"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"November 2007","description":"FOREWORD by Tom Kyte\n\nYour Must-Have Guide to Everything New in Oracle Database 11g\n\nRealize the full potential of Oracle Database 11g with help from the experts.

It has become an empire.\"Garrison traces the roots of the American empire to the very beginnings of the republic, in particular to the historic willingness of United States' to use military might in the defense of two consistent --- if sometimes contradictory --- foreign policy objectives: protection of American commercial interests and promotion of democracy.How long can the American empire last? Garrison looks at American history within the context of the rise and fall of empires and argues that the U. S. can gain important insights into durability from the Romans. He details the interplay between military power, political institutions, and legal structures that enabled the Roman empire at it's apogee to last for longer than America has as a country.But the real question is, what kind of empire can and should America be? As the sole superpower, America must lead in shaping a new global order, just as after World War II Roosevelt and Truman took the lead in shaping a new international order. That international order is now crumbling under the pressures of globalization, persistent poverty, terrorism and fundamentalism. Garrison outlines the kinds of cooperative global structures America must promote if its empire is to leave a lasting legacy of greatness. Garrison calls for Americans to consciously see themselves as a transitional empire, one whose task is not to dominate but to catalyze the next generation of global governance mechanisms that would make obsolete the need for empire.

This is also a major weakness when it tempts developers to start coding too soon. Small applications that consist of tens of pages can be coded without a lot of design work because they can be re-factored quickly when design flaws are discovered. Design flaws in large cloud and enterprise applications that consist of hundreds or thousands of pages are not so easy to re-factor due to the time needed to redevelop and retest the application, not to mention the risk of breaking functionality in subtle ways.\nDesigning a large application before coding starts is a profitable exercise because a thoughtful design goes a long way in mitigating cost overruns and schedule slippage while simultaneously enhancing quality. This book takes into account perspectives from other non-developer stakeholders such as maintenance developers, business analysts, testers, technical writers, end users, and business owners. Overlooking these perspectives is one of the chief causes of expensive rework late in the development cycle. \nOracle Application Express by Design illustrates APEX design principles by using architecture diagrams, screen shots, and explicit code snippets to guide developers through the many design choices and complex interrelationship issues that must be evaluated before embarking on large APEX projects.

No one person or group can possibly solve them—they require the broadest possible cooperation. But, says Harvard scholar Dean Williams, our leadership models are still essentially tribal: individuals with formal authority leading in the interest of their own group. In this deeply needed new book, he outlines an approach that enables leaders to transcend internal and external boundaries and help people to collaborate, even people over whom they technically have no power.Drawing on what he's learned from years of working in countries and organizations around the world, Williams shows leaders how to approach the delicate and creative work of boundary spanning, whether those boundaries are cultural, organizational, political, geographic, religious, or structural. Sometimes leaders themselves have to be the ones who cross the boundaries between groups. Other times, a leader's job is to build relational bridges between divided groups or even to completely break down the boundaries that block collaborative problem solving. By thinking about power and authority in a different way, leaders will become genuine change agents, able to heal wounds, resolve conflicts, and bring a fractured world together.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"1882197623","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Preparing for Development: Making the Most of Formal Leadership Programs","authors":["Jennifer Matrineau","Ellie Johnson"],"pages":"30","publication_date":"March 2001","description":"If you are scheduled to participate in a leadership development program, or if you're considering such a program, you can substantially increase the benefits to yourself and to your organization by preparing for the development experience.

Bestselling author and entrepreneur John Hope Bryant outlines the mindset and practices that will allow us to achieve the American Dream, no matter what our current circumstances are.Facing a challenging economy, too many Americans despair of improving their lives. But John Hope Bryant insists that America is still the Land of Opportunity. Up from Nothing revives the forgotten story of the American Dream. It's about our beginnings as a nation of go-getters who believed they were winners before they won. Using the inspiring story of his own rise from humble beginnings, and that of his parents and grandparents, Bryant shows how individually we can change our mindset from survivor to thriver to winner and move beyond just getting by or being financially independent to becoming wildly successful. Collectively, we need to become a nation of winners once again. By ensuring that every stakeholder in America has access to the Five Pillars of Success—massive education, financial literacy, strong family structure, self-esteem, and supportive role models—Bryant shows how we can fulfill the promise of America's greatness. But to do so, we must turn away from distractions—such as political in-fighting or racial and class divisions—and focus on what we can control. This is not a book of tips on how to get a better job or make more money. It's about adopting a new way of thinking that will do all that for us and more. Up from Nothing is the new (old) business plan to keep us winning as a country.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","History"]},{"id":"01520110038SI","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Positive Influence: How Leaders Get Others to See it Their Way","authors":["David Baldwin","Curt Grayson"],"pages":"6","publication_date":"January 2004","description":"Influence is an essential component of leadership, especially in today's organizations, which rely less on hierarchy and more on the leader's ability to get buy-in from others.

Next, the book investigates how leaders motivate their followers by creating follower self-efficacy, trust, and valued rewards. Then, the focus changes to the specific types of messages a leader can use to motivate followers.

Several parallel themes crosscut the book’s central focus on the discipline of history: its intellectual history, its historiography, and its connection to memory, particularly in relation to the need to establish the collective identity of ‘nation’, ‘community’ or state through a memorialisation process that has much to do with history, or at least with claiming a historicity for collective memory. None of this can be undertaken without an understanding of the roles that history-writing and history-reading have been made to perform in public debates, or perhaps more accurately in public disputes. The book addresses a discomfort with postcolonial theories in and as history. Following are essays that examine the state of the discipline, the art of reading and using archives, practices of tracking the history of ideas, and the themes of history, memory and identity.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","History"]},{"id":"9783110391404","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Classical Humanism and the Challenge of Modernity","authors":["Bas van Bommel"],"pages":"247","publication_date":"March 2015","description":"In scholarship, classical (Renaissance) humanism is usually strictly distinguished from 'neo-humanism', which, especially in Germany, flourished at the beginning of the 19th century. While most classical humanists focused on the practical imitation of Latin stylistic models, 'neohumanism' is commonly believed to have been mainly inspired by typically modern values, such as authenticity and historicity. Bas van Bommel shows that whereas 'neohumanism' was mainly adhered to at the German universities, at the Gymnasien a much more traditional educational ideal prevailed, which is best described as 'classical humanism.' This ideal involved the prioritisation of the Romans above the Greeks, as well as the belief that imitation of Roman and Greek models brings about man's aesthetic and moral elevation. Van Bommel makes clear that 19th century classical humanism dynamically related to modern society. On the one hand, classical humanists explained the value of classical education in typically modern terms. On the other hand, competitors of the classical Gymnasium laid claim to values that were ultimately derived from classical humanism. 19th century classical humanism should therefore not be seen as a dried-out remnant of a dying past, but as the continuation of a living tradition.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","Political Science"]},{"id":"9781633693791","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"White Working Class","authors":["Joan C.

Meanwhile, members of the professional elite—journalists, managers, and establishment politicians--are on the outside looking in, left to argue over the reasons. In White Working Class, Joan C. Williams, described as having \"something approaching rock star status\" by the New York Times, explains why so much of the elite's analysis of the white working class is misguided, rooted in class cluelessness.\n\nWilliams explains that many people have conflated \"working class\" with \"poor\"--but the working class is, in fact, the elusive, purportedly disappearing middle class. They often resent the poor and the professionals alike. But they don't resent the truly rich, nor are they particularly bothered by income inequality. Their dream is not to join the upper middle class, with its different culture, but to stay true to their own values in their own communities--just with more money. While white working-class motivations are often dismissed as racist or xenophobic, Williams shows that they have their own class consciousness.\n\nWhite Working Class is a blunt, bracing narrative that sketches a nuanced portrait of millions of people who have proven to be a potent political force. For anyone stunned by the rise of populist, nationalist movements, wondering why so many would seemingly vote against their own economic interests, or simply feeling like a stranger in their own country, White Working Class will be a convincing primer on how to connect with a crucial set of workers--and voters.","tags":["Other","Politics & Global Issues"]},{"id":"9783110653120","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"The Radicalization of European Jews in the US Metropolis","authors":["Frank Jacob"],"pages":"206","publication_date":"August 2024","description":"During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many Jews from Central and Eastern Europe arrived in New York City, where they did not only find a new home, but far away from their shtetl origin, the new members of the American society also began to politically radicalize.

Jahrhunderts verfügten die deutschen Bergleute mit den zahlreichen lokalen Knappschaftsvereinen über ein eigenes institutionalisiertes Sozialversicherungssystem mit einer langen, ins Mittelalter zurückreichenden Tradition. Ihren Mitgliedern boten die Knappschaftsvereine Versicherungsschutz gegen die wesentlichen Daseinsrisiken Krankheit, Invalidität, Tod des Ernährers der Familie und Langlebigkeit. Mit Blick auf die Periode zwischen Knappschaftsgesetz einerseits und Gründung der Reichsknappschaft andererseits (1854-1923) untersucht diese Arbeit ein versicherungsökonomisches Problem, über das bereits die zeitgenössischen Beobachter der Knappschaftsvereine intensiv diskutierten: Wie ist die optimale Größe eines Sozialversicherungsträgers zu bestimmen und zu implementieren? Gibt es überhaupt eine „optimale“ Größe? Oder gilt nicht vielmehr „je größer, desto besser“? Vor dem Hintergrund zweier ökonomischer Kategorien – versicherungstechnisches Risikos und Verwaltungseffizienz – werden diese Fragen am konkreten historischen Beispiel der preußischen Knappschaftsvereine untersucht. Obwohl die jüngere Historiographie die außerordentliche Bedeutung der Knappschaftsvereine des 19. Jahrhunderts als eines der ersten Sozialversicherungssysteme überhaupt herausgestellt hat, stellt deren Wirtschafts- bzw. Versicherungsgeschichte ein Forschungsdesiderat dar. Diese Arbeit füllt zu einem gewissen Grad diese Forschungslücke, indem sie auf ein historisches Phänomen fokussiert, dessen Analyse nicht ohne den direkten Bezug auf grundlegende ökonomische Zusammenhänge auskommt: der zu beobachtende Prozess interner und insbesondere externer Konzentration innerhalb der Knappschaftsvereine, der spätestens mit dem frühen 1870iger Jahren einsetzte und in der Gründung der Reichsknappschaft kulminierte.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","History"]},{"id":"9781118901397","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"View From the Top: An Inside Look at How People in Power See and Shape the World","authors":["M.

It's not something that just happens—unless you're very lucky. So why wouldn't you use experienced leaders to inspire, mentor, coach, and develop other talented leaders to their full potential? Here's the journey of Becton, Dickinson and Company (BD), which created and deployed a leadership development program that relies on all its top leaders (even the CEO) to train other leaders. From BD's success of improved business results, improved communications and strengthened organizational culture, your organization, too, can learn how to build and implement this vital program.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9780071604598","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Oracle Database 11g A Beginner's Guide","authors":["Ian Abramson","Michael Abbey","Michael Corey"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"October 2008","description":"Get a Solid Foundation in Oracle Database Technology\n\nMaster Oracle Database 11g fundamentals quickly and easily.

It's dealing with people who are too comfortable doing things the way they've always been done and too afraid to do things differently—workers who are, as author Bill Treasurer puts it, too “comfeartable.” Such workers fail to exert themselves any more than they have to, equating “just enough” with good enough. By avoiding even mild challenges, these workers thwart forward progress and make their businesses dangerously safe. To combat this affliction, Treasurer proposes a bold antidote: courage. In Courage Goes to Work, he lays out a comprehensive, step-by-step process that treats courage as a skill that can be developed and strengthened. He Treasurer shows how managers can build workplace courage by modeling courageous behavior themselves, creating an environment where people feel safe taking chances and helping workers deal with fear. To make the concept of courage more concrete, Treasurer identifies what he calls the Three Buckets of Courage: Try Courage, having the guts to take initiative; Trust Courage, being willing to follow the lead of others; and Tell Courage, being honest and assertive with coworkers and bosses. He illustrates each with a variety of vivid real-world examples and offers proven practices for helping your workers keep each bucket full. Aristotle said that courage is the first virtue because it makes all other virtues possible. It's as true in business as it is in life. With more courage, workers gain the necessary confidence to take on harder projects, embrace company changes with more enthusiasm, and extend themselves in ways that will benefit their careers and their company. Courage Goes to Work is the first book to take a systematic approach to developing a vital but overlooked component of business success.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"01120100016SI","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Venona Story","authors":["Robert L.

They are trying to integrate the most demanding and most coddled generation in history into a workplace shaped by the driven baby-boom generation. Like them or not, the millennials are America future work force. They are actually a larger group than the boomers—92 million vs. 78 million.\n\nThe millennials are truly trophy kids, the pride and joy of their parents who remain closely connected even as their children head off to college and enter the work force. Millennials are a complex generation, with some conflicting characteristics. Although they’re hard working and achievement oriented, most millennials don’t excel at leadership and independent problem solving. They want the freedom and flexibility of a virtual office, but they also want rules and responsibilities to be spelled out explicitly. “It’s all about me,” might seem to be the mantra of this demanding bunch of young people, yet they also tend to be very civic-minded and philanthropic.\n\nThis book will let readers meet the millennials and learn how this remarkable generation promises to stir up the workplace and perhaps the world. It provides a rich portrait of the millennials, told through the eyes of millennials themselves and from the perspectives of their parents, educators, psychologists, recruiters, and corporate managers. Clearly, the millennials represent a new breed of student, worker, and global citizen, and this book explores in depth their most salient attributes, particularly as they are playing out in the workplace. It also describes how companies are changing tactics to recruit millennials in the Internet age and looks at some of this generation’s dream jobs.","tags":["Other"]},{"id":"9780814412794","language":"en","level":null,"title":"The Sustainable Enterprise Fieldbook: When It all Comes Together","authors":["PhD Jeana Wirtenberg","William G.

While hospitals and health systems nationwide have laid people off or are closing their doors, Scripps is financially healthy, has added thousands of employees (even with a no-layoff philosophy), and has developed a reputation as a top employer. What are the secrets to this remarkable story?\n\nIn The Front-Line Leader, Chris Van Gorder candidly shares his own incredible story, from police officer to CEO, and the leadership philosophy that drives all of his decisions and actions: people come first. Van Gorder began his unlikely career as a California police officer, which deeply instilled in him a sense of social responsibility, honesty, and public service. After being injured on the job and taking an early retirement, Van Gorder had to reinvent himself, taking a job as a hospital security director, a job that would change his life. Through hard work and determination, he rose to executive ranks, eventually becoming CEO of Scripps. But he never forgot his own roots and powerful work ethic, or the time when he was a security officer and a CEO would not make eye contact with him.\n\nVan Gorder leads from the front lines, making it a priority to know his employees and customers at every level. His values learned on the force—protecting the community, educating citizens, developing caring relationships, and ultimately doing the right thing—shape his approach to business. As much as companies talk about accountability, managers seldom understand what practical steps to take to achieve an ethic of service that makes accountability meaningful. The Front-Line Leader outlines specific tactics and steps anyone can use starting today to take responsibility, inspire others, and achieve breakout results for their organizations. Van Gorder reveals how a no-layoff philosophy led to higher accountability, how his own attention to seemingly minor details spurred larger change, and how his own high standards for himself and his team improved morale and productivity.\n\nFrom general strategy to the tiny, everyday steps leaders can take to create the kind of culture and accountability that translates into major competitive advantage, The Front-Line Leader charts a path to better leadership and a more engaged, higher-performing organization.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781604913293","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Leadership in Action: Issues and Observations - Leading Yourself Through Change","authors":["Robert A.

Just a few decades later, the state finds itself with an education system that is failing its citizens, one of the highest unemployment rates in the nation, and a quickly evaporating dream of home ownership.\n\nIllustrating each step of the breakdown that led to its current state of dysfunction, Not So Golden After All: The Rise and Fall of California provides insight into a system gone amuck. It addresses complicated topics in an engaging manner to help the public and leaders alike understand how to make policies that balance expectations with outcomes. Key political themes covered include disconnected institutions, perpetually unbalanced budgets, immigration, voter ignorance, interest group influence, and dysfunctional institutions. Investigating the gridlock that has become all too common within the state’s legislature, the book:\n\nDemonstrates the impact of the state’s inability to generate sufficient revenue, particularly for public education and an under-trained workforce\nHighlights the problems created by poor land use planning —from suburban sprawl and government waste to inefficient use of agricultural land\nExamines how interest groups have been able to wrest control of the processes that were created to keep them in line\nIdentifies the duplication of efforts and other inefficiencies at the state and local levels\n\nAuthor Larry Gerston leaves no stone unturned in his discussion of California's economy, position on the Pacific Rim, cultural diversity, land and water issues, and its relationship with the federal government. He examines the state’s infrastructure, natural resources, immigration issues, education, finance, healthcare, civil rights, planning and development, security, laws, political parties, and power structures to provide civic leaders and policy makers with the understanding required to restore the sheen to this once glistening paradise.\n\nThe Contra Costa Times discussed Larry Gerston's recent Commonwealth Club lecture in a May 17, 2012 article.

This collection of Black women's voices… is a must-read, not only for Black girls, but for everyone who cares about Black girls, and for Black women whose inner-Black girl could use some healing.” – Tarana Burke, Founder of the ‘Me Too' Movement\"Dear Dope Black Girl, You don't know me, but I know you. I know you because I am you! We are magic, light, and stars in the universe.” So begins a letter that Tamara Winfrey Harris received as part of her Letters to Black Girls project, where she asked black women to write honest, open, and inspiring letters of support to young black girls aged thirteen to twenty-one. Her call went viral, resulting in a hundred personal letters from black women around the globe that cover topics such as identity, self-love, parents, violence, grief, mental health, sex, and sexuality. In Dear Black Girl, Winfrey Harris organizes a selection of these letters, providing “a balm for the wounds of anti-black-girlness” and modeling how black women can nurture future generations. Each chapter ends with a prompt encouraging girls to write a letter to themselves, teaching the art of self-love and self-nurturing. Winfrey Harris's The Sisters Are Alright explores how black women must often fight and stumble their way into alrightness after adulthood.

The problems are complex, the politics murky, and the players innumerable. Yet, every day there are regular heroes making a significant impact on our most intractable social issues.\n\n\"Can't Not Do\" is a catchphrase for the urge that captures the heart of effective social change agents—explaining, in their own words, their passion and drive: \"I can't not do this.\" \"It's not that I can do this, it's that I can't not.\" \"I could not imagine not doing something about this issue.\" The surprising truth from the trenches is: we already have numerous proven solutions for our many social challenges; what our world needs most, and what most changes our children's future, are more people prepared and committed to act on their social impulses for the long haul. Innovation helps. Money helps, too. But greater numbers of committed people help the most.\n\nIf you feel an internal, persistent call to do more for the world, Can't Not Do will help you to bridge the gap between \"wanting to do\" and \"doing\"—to access the drive of an effective change agent, to break through self-imposed barriers, to learn key principles for success, and to start seeing yourself acting as a change agent.\n\nThere is no \"secret sauce\" someone is born with and no special club needed to be successful at social change. Rather, successful change agents share some fundamental orientations to the world and to their committed cause and, over time, learn certain lessons that help them become more effective. These lessons are reflected in Can't Not Do in seven seemingly simple questions that provide guideposts and unlock the reader's potential to make a difference for a social cause they care about.\n\nThis isn't a self-help book. It's an inspiring narrative intertwined with a \"street-readiness\" dialogue, between the author and you, between you and your inner aspirations. These are authentic success stories, vital questions, and unconventional answers that can guide and inspire you to realize your greatest potential.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9780137001453","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"The Truth About Motivating Your Employees: The Essential Truths in 20 Minutes","authors":["Martha I.

However, a scarcity of leaders today means a shortfall in performance tomorrow. Don't gamble with your company's future!You don't need to hope that leaders emerge from the ranks or that search firms can find the leaders you need in a timely fashion. Hope is not a strategy!

Bestselling author and Chick-fil-A executive Mark Miller describes how to nurture leaders throughout the organization, from the front lines to the executive ranks.

Its purpose is to help leaders determine how to choose and move among a variety of managerial approaches--to help them see what's working, what's not working, and what's missing.

Books and courses on leadership flood the market as companies search in vain for that one person who can make sense of their rapidly changing environment through assertiveness, charisma, and control. According to noted consultant Harrison Owen, our inability to locate such a person isn't the fault of our leaders, it's the fault of our expectations.In today's world where chaos is \"normal\" and paradoxes can't be resolved, such old-style leaders no longer offer the solution. Today's world requires inspired leadership from all levels of the organization. \"Inspired leadership\" literally means in-spirited leadership, and this book explores the intimate connection between spirit and leadership it implies. It presents the radical notion that spirit is the most important ingredient of any organization and that leadership means opening space for that spirit to show up in powerful and productive ways.The Spirit of Leadership lays out the New Rules of Leadership, rules which surprisingly turnOl organizations have always played by. For the keys to these new rules, the book turns to those who have always successfully operated apart from the levers of formal power and authority-women. Offering lessons from effective female strategies, it reveals the true functions of leadership: to evoke, grow, sustain, comfort, and raise the spirit.Not to be confused with morale building, motivational techniques, or even the current fad of spirituality in business, The Spirit of Leadership digs deeper to show that, at its essence, leadership is our link to deep inner forces. It provides practical steps readers can use to uncover their own capacity for leadership in whatever position they find themselves, and to exercise that capacity both to enhance the performance of their organizations and to find their own fulfillment as complete human beings.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9780133133929","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"In Line Behind a Billion People: How Scarcity will Define China’s Ascent in the Next Decade","authors":["Damien Ma","William Adams"],"pages":"352","publication_date":"August 2013","description":"Nearly everything you know about China is wrong! Yes, within a decade, China will have the world’s largest economy. But that is the least important thing to know about China. In this enlightening book, two of the world’s leading China experts turn the conventional wisdom on its head, showing why China’s economic growth will constrain rather than empower it. Pioneering political analyst Damien Ma and global economist Bill Adams reveal why, having 35 years of ferocious economic growth, China’s future will be shaped by the same fundamental reality that has shaped it for millennia: scarcity. Ma and Adams drill deep into Chinese society, illuminating all the scarcities that will limit its power and progress. Beyond scarcities of natural resources and public goods, they illuminate China’s persistent poverties of individual freedoms, cultural appeal, and ideological legitimacy — and the corrosive loss of values and beliefs amongst a growing middle class shackled by a parochial and inflexible political system. Everyone knows “the 21st century is China’s to lose” — but, as with so many things that “everyone knows,” that’s just wrong. Ma and Adams get beyond cheerleading and fearmongering to tell the complex truth about China today. This is a truth you need to hear — whether you’re an investor, business decision-maker, policymaker, or citizen.","tags":["Other","Politics & Global Issues"]},{"id":"9781482215656","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Pocket Guide to the Baldrige Award Criteria (5-Pack), 17th Edition","authors":["Mark Graham Brown","Jonathan Craig"],"pages":"64","publication_date":"June 2013","description":"Updated yearly to match changing requirements, this guide is designed to help you understand the criteria for the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award.

Charles Halpern is a social entrepreneur with a remarkable record of institutional innovation. He founded the Center for Law and Social Policy, the nation's first public interest law firm, litigating landmark environmental protection and constitutional rights cases. As founding dean of the new City University of New York School of Law he initiated a bold program for training public interest lawyers as whole people. Later, as president of the $400 million Nathan Cummings Foundation, he launched an innovative grant program that drew together social justice advocacy with meditation and spiritual inquiry. In his years of activism, he had a growing intuition that something was missing, and he sought ways of developing inner resources that complemented his cognitive and adversarial skills. These explorations led him to the conviction that what he calls the practice of wisdom is essential to his effectiveness and well-being and to our collective capacity to address the challenges of the 21st century successfully.With wit and self-deprecating humor, Halpern shares candid and revealing lessons from every stage of his life, describing his journey and the teachers and colleagues he encountered on the way—a cast of characters that includes Barney Frank and Ralph Nader, Ram Dass and the Dalai Lama. Making Waves and Riding the Currents vividly demonstrates the life-enhancing benefits of integrating a commitment to social justice with the cultivation of wisdom.

Williams, described as having \"something approaching rock star status\" by the New York Times, explains that many people have conflated \"working class\" with \"poor\"--but the working class is, in fact, the elusive, purportedly disappearing middle class. They often resent the poor and the professionals alike. But they don't resent the truly rich, nor are they particularly bothered by income inequality. Their dream is not to join the upper middle class, with its different culture, but to stay true to their own values in their own communities--just with more money. While white working-class motivations are often dismissed as racist or xenophobic, Williams shows that they have their own class consciousness.\n\nWhite Working Class is a blunt, bracing narrative that sketches a nuanced portrait of millions of people who have proven to be a potent political force. For anyone stunned by the rise of populist, nationalist movements, wondering why so many would seemingly vote against their own economic interests, or simply feeling like a stranger in their own country, White Working Class will be a convincing primer on how to connect with a crucial set of workers--and voters.","tags":["Other","Politics & Global Issues"]},{"id":"9788131785751","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"A Social Charter for India","authors":["Muchkund Dubey","M.

While during its predecessors most participants wanted to familiarize themselves with the central components of the Inverted Classroom Model, the focus of the 3rd German Inverted Classroom Conference in 2014, to which this conference volume is dedicated, was not only a discussion of variants of the model but also, for the first time, the inclusion of long-term evaluations and aspects of student behavior.This shift of emphasis is reflected in the contributions to this volume. Even though all central aspects of the ICM - content production and delivery, testing, and the in-class phase - are still addressed, we can now find recommendations concerning digital material acquisition, in-class tuition, the role of student tutors as well as first long-term studies about ICM effects.In general then, the focus was much wider than that of the first two ICM-conferences: from a new and originally non-familiar teaching and learning scenario to more general aspects of digitization of teaching and learning in the 21st century.","tags":["Other","Education"]},{"id":"758604","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Create Effective Workshops—Training Basics","authors":["Geoffrey M.

Those with moxie can read people and situations and know how and when to execute for results. The world “moxie” also serves as an acronym for Motivation, Opportunity, an X factor, Innovation, and Engagement that work together for success. Moxie is one-part courage, one-part can-do spirit, and one-part recognition; it is a concept that the modern leader would be wise to adopt.

They must contend with chronic uncertainty, cynical employees, and personal burnout. Most are poorly served by the prevailing paradigm that obsessively focuses on what we do to produce short-term results while sabotaging who we are as healthy human beings. Few have seen alternatives, until now.\n\nGrounded proposes a new approach that's designed for actual humans who must grapple with these forces. This new paradigm speaks to our better selves. Based on the author's Healthy Leader model, it focuses on the six personal dimensions that fuel—and refuel—the world's top leaders: physical, emotional, intellectual, social, vocational, and spiritual health.\n\nThe book argues that leaders at every level can be more self-aware, develop their untapped potential, and drive significantly better results—for themselves, their teams, and their organizations.\n\nShows readers how to build a personal leadership model that works with their values, goals and capabilities\n\nFeatures fresh stories from leaders in a variety of organizations including the New York Fire Department, PricewaterhouseCoopers, The Lego Group, and Medstar Health\n\nGives leaders practical tools to face their toughest challenges with greater skill, confidence, and impact\n\nBy developing themselves and mastering the six dimensions, readers can gain the stamina and strength to not only weather tough times but to achieve much, much more.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9780787996048","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"In Extremis Leadership","authors":["Thomas A.

They expect decision-making support and performance insights that can improve bottom-line results. Unfortunately, the complexity and detail inherent in CFOs’ jobs keep them shackled to budgeting and transaction-processing systems that leave little time for value-adding activities. Jeremy Hope says it’s time to redefine the role of CFOs in today’s organizations, liberating them from ineffective number-crunching responsibilities and enabling them to focus on helping managers improve performance. Grounded in extensive research, Reinventing the CFO outlines seven critical roles—from streamlining redundant processes to regulating risk to identifying a few key measures—that CFOs must take on in order to successfully transform the finance operation.Challenging many of the finance field’s accepted practices and systems, this bold book revolutionizes the role of financial managers and frees them to make smart, ethical, strategic decisions that add real value to the firm.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781631575761","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"As I See It…","authors":["Professor Michael R.

These radical improvements might result from R&D efforts within the organization (proactive) that propel the organization and its products and services to the cutting edge of the markets in which they operate. Or these radical improvements might be developed by competitors or even by organizations in other industries (reactive) which, if ignored, might threaten the long-term survival of the organization if they are not recognized and reacted to in an appropriate way. This book is about how to think differently about quality and by doing so increase the creativity, innovation, and agility of an organization and its employees as well as the awareness of new developments in the marketplace and their possible impact on the organization and its markets. Quality must be addressed in strategic as well as operational terms in order for organizations to compete effectively over the long term. Strategic quality management requires insightful leadership. This book is about attaining the insight required to increase organizational creativity, innovation, and agility to create new paradigms, and survive paradigm shifts that originate outside the organization. Each chapter contains short cases illustrations about real organizations that illustrate the main points of that chapter. This book does not describe a detailed process that ostensibly leads to insight. Rather this book takes the position that what works for one organization might not work as effectively for another. It challenges leaders and managers to adopt a new way of thinking and presents thought-provoking ideas about how organizations can begin the process of charting their own paths to insight--and lasting success.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781951527013","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Olympic Sports Economy","authors":["Max Donner"],"pages":"194","publication_date":"December 2019","description":"The Olympic Sports Economy incorporates exclusive case studies and reports from sports management conferences to illustrate the most important business practices and trends of the Olympics today.\n\nEvery two years, the Olympics wins world attention with contests and celebrations.

In this book, Harvard Business School Professor Joseph Badaracco answers this question in practical and, at times, provocative ways.Leaders today are surrounded by what Badaracco calls the new invisible hand”powerful, pervasive markets that touch and shape almost everything. As a result, understanding the inevitability and importance of struggle is critical. And leaders must go a step further to create what Badaracco calls the good struggle” in order to meet their goals at work, as well as their goals in life.The Good Struggle helps you meet the relentless challenges of being a leader today by identifying the most important questions you should be asking yourself. New answers to these questions can be found by watching leaders in dynamic settings, especially entrepreneurs. The conditions entrepreneurs have always facedintense competition, scarce resources, and unforgiving marketsare true now for the rest of us, and they offer valuable, practical lessons about struggling and succeeding in volatile and uncertain environments.If the joy of life is in the struggle,” as one thoughtful entrepreneur put it, The Good Struggle can help you find meaning in your work, stay focused on what matters despite the turbulence around you, and keep you on the path to leading successfully and responsibly.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9783110395532","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Orientalism, Gender, and the Jews","authors":["Ulrike Brunotte","Anna-Dorothea Ludewig","Axel Stähler"],"pages":"326","publication_date":"December 2014","description":"Originating in the collaboration of the international Research Network “Gender in Antisemitism, Orientalism and Occidentalism” (RENGOO), this collection of essays proposes to intervene in current debates about historical constructions of Jewish identity in relation to colonialism and Orientalism.

It is designed to give both the theoretical knowledge and the tools for action if you are to change the power dynamics in your organization.\n\nIndeed, to operate in a global environment that is increasingly more relational than transactional, it is vital to cultivate globally competitive leaders to deal with ongoing change and challenges. The Power of Belonging is about addressing the challenge faced by most leaders: how to influence and achieve organizational goals.\n\nThis is also a book for individuals, especially as they learn that we cannot define ourselves by single dimensions – we are a synthesis of our backgrounds, experiences and philosophies. And we must come as the whole people that we are to form sustainable and meaningful relationships with others around the world. The most difficult lesson to learn perhaps is that belonging will remain a puzzle until we find that it has a personal dwelling place – that we must first belong deeply to ourselves.\n\nReady to be a change agent?

Frequently, rapport between researcher and researched is invoked as a prerequisite to be achieved before fieldwork can start, or used as evidence to judge the value and robustness of an ethnography. With few exceptions, and despite regular pleas to do so, ethnographers continue to avoid presenting any discursive evidence of what rapport might look like from an interactional perspective. In a sense, the uncritical acceptance of rapport as a fieldwork goal and measure has helped hide the discursive work that goes on in the field. In turn, this has privileged ideas about identity as portable rather than “portable and emergent”, and reports of social life as more important than how such reports emerge. Written for all those who engage or plan to engage in ethnographic fieldwork, this collection examines how social relationships dialogically emerge in fieldwork settings.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences"]},{"id":"9781501505829","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Nonprofits as Policy Solutions to the Burden of Government","authors":["Herrington J.

Designing and engaging nonprofits to lessen the burden of government requires a specific description and acknowledgement of the burden to be lessened, and these may include the provision of infrastructure, the relief of debt, or the provision of general public services that are not motivated by charity. It also requires the assignment of specific operating powers to the nonprofit including the power of eminent domain. This book explores these and other related topics including the avoidance of resource dependence on government when attempting to reduce its burden.\n\nThe book is addressed to the policy makers and rule makers who design policies that affect the ability of the nonprofit to effectively lessen the burden of government. It is also addressed to public administrators in search of innovative ways of implementing these policies consistent with the laws, and to the creative nonprofit managers who are charged with carrying out the mission often in collaboration with the government or other entities. To the advanced student in all related fields, the author offers not only material for discussion, but enables discovery of what is possible by giving key examples of organizations meeting the terms and objective of lessening a significant burden of government.","tags":["Other","Humanities & Social Sciences","Political Science"]},{"id":"9783111137599","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Hungary as a Sport Superpower","authors":["Lorenzo Venuti"],"pages":"328","publication_date":"June 2024","description":"The RERIS Studies in International Sport Relations series publishes books that explore interconnectivity between several actors (people, organizations, and/or states) at the international level.

What if our brains are hard-wired for selfishness and similarity and not for diversity and altruism? Having a diverse workforce is no guarantee that the work environment is inclusive. Companies hire for diversity and manage for similarity. We hire people for their difference and then teach them directly and indirectly what they have to do to fit in to the corporate culture. The Illusion of Inclusion exposes a myriad of diverse reasons why people are not more fully engaged and offers you the key to unlock the “Geometry of Inclusion”. This book takes the lid off Pandora’s box and explores the complexity of inclusion; where affinity bias or “mini-me” syndrome and the need to fit in are unconsciously blocking our ability to be inclusive.

Some level of proficiency can be demonstrated by simply focusing on leading others. But to achieve transformational results, leading self is essential. Cultivating self-awareness and developing a life plan are key elements of leading self. And really, should not leaders demonstrate a level of self-mastery before leading others? It is time that leaders move to a deeper understanding of themselves as they operate within a world of accelerated change and increasing complexity. Although leadership performance is evidenced in outward results, decisions, and actions, the genesis of the leadership performance is an internal endeavor. Resiliency and ethical behavior are grounded by having a strong sense of purpose, established vision, and clear operating values. To the degree that the leader is consciously leading self, the quality of his or her leadership corresponds. Be it for good or evil, conscious leadership is powerful. This book makes plain the case for enhanced self-awareness, provides case studies and research support, presents the voices of several master leadership coaches, and most importantly…leads the reader through the life planning process.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9780415527590","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Post-Tsunami Reconstruction in Indonesia","authors":["Marjaana Jauhola"],"pages":"218","publication_date":"June 2013","description":"This book offers a critical analysis of gender mainstreaming initiatives in the post-tsunami context in Indonesia. Aiming to challenge the terms of the debate in gender mainstreaming and disaster reconstruction efforts, Jauhola offers an important contribution for the discussion of what ‘feminisms and disasters’ could be.
