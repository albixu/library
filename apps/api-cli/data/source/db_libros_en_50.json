Artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed many fields, including robotics. This book shows you how to reimagine decades-old robotics problems as AI problems and is a handbook for solving problems using modern techniques in an era of large foundation models. \n\nThe book begins with an introduction to general-purpose robotics, how robots are modeled, and how physical intelligence relates to the movement of building artificial general intelligence, while giving you an overview of the current state of the field, its challenges, and where we are headed. The first half of this book delves into defining what the problems in robotics are, how to frame them as AI problems, and the details of how to solve them using modern AI techniques. First, we look at robot perception and sensing to understand how robots perceive their environment, and discuss convolutional networks and vision transformers to solve robotics problems such as segmentation, classification, and detection in two and three dimensions. The book then details how to apply large language and multimodal models for robotics, and how to adapt them to solve reasoning and robot control. Simulation, localization, and mapping and navigation are framed as deep learning problems and discussed with recent research. Lastly, the first part of this book discusses reinforcement learning and control and how robots learn via trial and error and self-play.\n\nThe second part of this book is concerned with applications of robotics in specialized contexts. You will develop full stack knowledge by applying the techniques discussed in the first part to real-world use cases.

Powell"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"March 2022","description":"REINFORCEMENT LEARNING AND STOCHASTIC OPTIMIZATION\n\nClearing the jungle of stochastic optimization\n\nSequential decision problems, which consist of “decision, information, decision, information,” are ubiquitous, spanning virtually every human activity ranging from business applications, health (personal and public health, and medical decision making), energy, the sciences, all fields of engineering, finance, and e-commerce. The diversity of applications attracted the attention of at least 15 distinct fields of research, using eight distinct notational systems which produced a vast array of analytical tools. A byproduct is that powerful tools developed in one community may be unknown to other communities.\n\nReinforcement Learning and Stochastic Optimization offers a single canonical framework that can model any sequential decision problem using five core components: state variables, decision variables, exogenous information variables, transition function, and objective function. This book highlights twelve types of uncertainty that might enter any model and pulls together the diverse set of methods for making decisions, known as policies, into four fundamental classes that span every method suggested in the academic literature or used in practice.\n\nReinforcement Learning and Stochastic Optimization is the first book to provide a balanced treatment of the different methods for modeling and solving sequential decision problems, following the style used by most books on machine learning, optimization, and simulation. The presentation is designed for readers with a course in probability and statistics, and an interest in modeling and applications. Linear programming is occasionally used for specific problem classes. The book is designed for readers who are new to the field, as well as those with some background in optimization under uncertainty.\n\nThroughout this book, readers will find references to over 100 different applications, spanning pure learning problems, dynamic resource allocation problems, general state-dependent problems, and hybrid learning/resource allocation problems such as those that arose in the COVID pandemic. There are 370 exercises, organized into seven groups, ranging from review questions, modeling, computation, problem solving, theory, programming exercises and a “diary problem” that a reader chooses at the beginning of the book, and which is used as a basis for questions throughout the rest of the book.","tags":["Data","AI & ML","Machine Learning","Machine Learning Methods","Reinforcement Learning"]},{"id":"9788177585674","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Database Systems: Concepts, Design and Applications","authors":["S.

First, you'll learn the best practices for writing Ruby code that's easy not only on the CPU, but also on memory, and that doesn't trigger the dreaded garbage collector. You'll find out that garbage collection accounts for 80% of slowdowns, and often takes more than 50% of your program's execution time. And you'll discover the bottlenecks in Rails code and learn how selective attribute loading and preloading can mitigate the performance costs of ActiveRecord.As you advance to Ruby performance expert, you'll learn how profile your code, how to make sense out of profiler reports, and how to make optimization decisions based on them. You'll make sure slow code doesn't creep back into your Ruby application by writing performance tests, and you'll learn the right way to benchmark Ruby. And finally, you'll dive into the Ruby interpreter internals to really understand why garbage collection makes Ruby so slow, and how you can tune it up. What You Need:Some version of Ruby.

But it was not until 2011 that the ISO released a SQL standard that supported it. Currently, among major DBMS vendors, Oracle, IBM and Teradata now provide at least some bitemporal functionality in their flagship products. But to use these products effectively, someone in your IT organization needs to know more than how to code bitemporal SQL statements. Perhaps, in your organization, that person is you.\n\nTo correctly interpret business requests for temporal data, to correctly specify requirements to your IT development staff, and to correctly design bitemporal databases and applications, someone in your enterprise needs a deep understanding of both the theory and the practice of managing bitemporal data. Someone also needs to understand what the future may bring in the way of additional temporal functionality, so their enterprise can plan for it. Perhaps, in your organization, that person is you.\n\nThis is the book that will show the do-it-yourself IT professional how to design and build bitemporal databases and how to write bitemporal transactions and queries, and will show those who will direct the use of vendor-provided bitemporal DBMSs exactly what is going on \"under the covers\" of that software.\n\nExplains the business value of bitemporal data in terms of the information that can be provided by bitemporal tables and not by any other form of temporal data, including history tables, version tables, snapshot tables, or slowly-changing dimensions\nProvides an integrated account of the mathematics, logic, ontology and semantics of relational theory and relational databases, in terms of which current relational theory and practice can be seen as unnecessarily constrained to the management of nontemporal and incompletely temporal data\nExplains how bitemporal tables can provide the time-variance and nonvolatility hitherto lacking in Inmon historical data warehouses\nExplains how bitemporal dimensions can replace slowly-changing dimensions in Kimball star schemas, and why they should do so\nDescribes several extensions to the current theory and practice of bitemporal data, including the use of episodes, \"whenever\" temporal transactions and queries, and future transaction time\nPoints out a basic error in the ISO’s bitemporal SQL standard, and warns practitioners against the use of that faulty functionality. Recommends six extensions to the ISO standard which will increase the business value of bitemporal data\nPoints towards a tritemporal future for bitemporal data, in which an Aristotelian ontology and a speech-act semantics support the direct management of the statements inscribed in the rows of relational tables, and add the ability to track the provenance of database content to existing bitemporal databases\nThis book also provides the background needed to become a business ontologist, and explains why an IT data management person, deeply familiar with corporate databases, is best suited to play that role.

Those businesses that enjoy a good reputation are able to differentiate themselves, thus attracting investments and retaining customers and employees, while at the same time, stakeholders of such companies demonstrate higher levels of satisfaction and loyalty towards the companies’ products and brands. Currently, corporate reputation is one of the most popular non-financial indicators used by organizations, both in the public and private sectors. This book is an in-depth investigation of the psychosocial nature of corporate reputation, and we invite the reader to join us on a journey of discovery. When reputation first appeared as a concept, it brought about promises and hopes. It was viewed as a solution capable of reconciling the interests of different stakeholders and making the whole organization stronger. However, this giant soon turned out to have feet of clay, as it was lacking in sufficient theoretical and methodological foundation. Nonetheless, when we step into the terra incognita of corporate intangible assets, we will understand that the vague idea of reputation is gradually acquiring a scientific form thanks to the development of measurement tools and models that lay a foundation for the long sought-after means of managing reputation.","tags":["Design","Product Design","Web Design","Reputation Systems"]},{"id":"9781394241149","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Open RAN","authors":["Vladimir Yanover"],"pages":"240","publication_date":"January 2025","description":"Complete guide to identifying and describing basic Open RAN technology concepts and understanding the structure and dynamics of the ecosystem\n\nOpen RAN describes key aspects and provides insight into the structure and dynamics of the Open RAN ecosystem, linking the key technology aspects to the market drivers and showing the role of technology in the ecosystem's progress.\n\nThis book explores Open RAN cloudification techniques and deployment scenarios down to details of the RAN split options and use of hardware accelerators.

With the power of SAP HANA and the enhancements introduced in ABAP 7.5, developers are now equipped to rethink how applications are built, executed, and optimized. This book is your guide to that transformation.\n\nWe begin by understanding the core shift: moving data-intensive operations directly into the HANA database. When implemented correctly, this \"code pushdown\" philosophy dramatically reduces data transfer and processing overhead. AMDP (ABAP Managed Database Procedures), our in-database processing engine, enables us to write complex logic directly in SQLScript, harnessing HANA’s parallel processing capabilities. We focus on crafting efficient AMDP procedures by adopting set-based operations and minimizing unnecessary data movement.\n\nNext, we explore Core Data Services (CDS) Views, our go-to data modeling tool. CDS Views are not just simple database views; they act as semantic layers that define how our applications interact with data. We learn to create optimized CDS Views by leveraging associations, annotations, and table functions, enabling us to build reusable, high-performance data models. These views simplify complex queries, improve data consistency, and enhance application flexibility.\n\nWe then turn to Native SQL, our direct line to the HANA database. While AMDP and CDS Views provide powerful abstractions, Native SQL offers ultimate control for specialized tasks. We embed Native SQL within AMDP procedures to access database-specific features and fine-tune performance for critical operations. Along the way, we apply best practices for writing efficient queries, with a strong focus on indexing, join strategies, and precise data filtering.\n\nThroughout this journey, we emphasize the importance of rigorous testing and proactive monitoring. Just like a race car undergoes extensive testing before hitting the track, our ABAP applications require careful validation to ensure accuracy and optimal performance. We explore techniques for unit testing AMDP procedures, validating CDS Views, and monitoring query performance. We also look at strategies for detecting and addressing potential bottlenecks before they affect end users.\n\nSAP ABAP 7.5 Optimization for HANA is not just about writing faster code—it’s about fundamentally rethinking how we develop applications. By embracing code pushdown, leveraging AMDP, CDS Views, and Native SQL, and implementing robust testing and monitoring strategies, we build ABAP applications that are not only faster, but also more scalable, maintainable, and adaptable to the ever-evolving demands of modern business.\n\nYou Will:\n\nLearn how to implement the \"code pushdown\" philosophy, moving data-intensive operations directly into the HANA database to reduce data transfer and processing overhead\nUnderstand to create optimized CDS Views, leveraging associations, annotations, and table functions to build reusable, high-performance data models that simplify complex queries and improve data consistency.\nExplore how to write complex logic directly in SQLScript using AMDP, harnessing HANA's parallel processing capabilities, and using Native SQL for specialized tasks, accessing database-specific features to optimize performance.\n\nThis Book is For:\n\nABAP Developers, SAP Consultants and Architects and IT Managers and Technical Leads","tags":["Data","Data Engineering","Relational Databases","SAP HANA"]},{"id":"9780730307662","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"The Game Changer: How to Use the Science of Motivation With the Power of Game Design to Shift Behaviour, Shape Culture and Make Clever Happen","authors":["Jason Fox"],"pages":"232","publication_date":"April 2014","description":"Use the science of motivation with the power of game design to unlock motivation and drive progress in your organisation.\n\nThere are two conventional ways to approach motivation: set goals and try to change attitudes and beliefs (which takes a lot of personalised effort); or develop incentives and rewards to inspire effort (which takes a lot of money).\n\nThis book shows you how to take a third new approach - designing the work itself to be inherently motivating.\n\nCombining the best elements of three distinct fields—motivational science, game design, and agile management—this book shows you how to positively influence behaviour through better work and project design.\n\nThis game changing book:\n\nGives you a refreshing science-based approach to the classic challenge of motivation in the workplace\n\nIs ideal for any leader or manager looking to take their workplace culture in a new direction\n\nIncludes practical advice for creating highly productive, motivated and innovative teams\n\nIs written by a motivation strategy and design expert who consults on leadership and change management to a wide range of clients - from the executives of multinational organisations, through to the directors of switched-on startups.\n\nThe Game Changer will show you how to unlock creative, productive and collaborative work.

Designed as a handy resource when you need quick solutions or techniques, the book offers dozens of short, focused pieces of code and hundreds of worked-out examples for programmers of all levels who don't have the time (or expertise) to solve MySQL problems from scratch.\n\nThe new edition covers MySQL 5.0 and its powerful new features, as well as the older but still widespread MySQL 4.1. One major emphasis of this book is how to use SQL to formulate queries for particular kinds of questions, using the mysql client program included in MySQL distributions. The other major emphasis is how to write programs that interact with the MySQL server through an API. You'll find plenty of examples using several language APIs in multiple scenarios and situations, including the use of Ruby to retrieve and format data. There are also many new examples for using Perl, PHP, Python, and Java as well.\n\nOther recipes in the book teach you to:\n\nAccess data from multiple tables at the same time\nUse SQL to select, sort, and summarize rows\nFind matches or mismatches between rows in two tables\nDetermine intervals between dates or times, including age calculations\nStore images into MySQL and retrieve them for display in web pages\nGet LOAD DATA to read your data files properly or find which values in the file are invalid\nUse strict mode to prevent entry of bad data into your database\nCopy a table or a database to another server\nGenerate sequence numbers to use as unique row identifiers\nCreate database events that execute according to a schedule\nAnd a lot more\n\nMySQL Cookbook doesn't attempt to develop full-fledged, complex applications. Instead, it's intended to assist you in developing applications yourself by helping you get past problems that have you stumped.","tags":["Data","Data Engineering","Relational Databases","MySQL"]},{"id":"9781439862872","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Distributed Sensor Networks, 2nd Edition","authors":["S.

These days, even a small organization or web site has uses for a database, and MySQL is an obvious choice. Affordable and easy to use, MySQL packs the power, speed and efficiency that enable it to rival expensive, proprietary database solutions. Yet, even if you know the basics, anyone without practical MySQL experience--novices and skilled DBAs alike--might stumble over common database-related tasks. Fortunately, there's a sensible shortcut. MySQL Cookbook provides a unique problem-and-solution format that offers practical examples for everyday programming dilemmas. For every problem addressed in the book, there's a worked-out solution or \"recipe\"--short, focused pieces of code that you can insert directly into your applications. But MySQL Cookbook is more than a collection of cut-and-paste code. You also get explanations of how and why the code works, so you can learn to adapt the techniques to similar situations. The book covers a lot of ground. Solutions for typical MySQL dilemmas range from simple ways to find all records that contain a given string, to more difficult problems, such as finding matching/non-matching records in two tables. Whether you use MySQL on Unix, Linux, Windows or the Mac OS X platform, the book will show you how to:\n\nImport data from external sources\n\nExport data for use by external programs\n\nAccess MySQL from your web server\n\nUse scripts with MySQL to read queries from a file\n\nAccess MySQL from within client programs that use Perl, PHP, Java, Python and other languages\n\nConstruct queries that solve commonly-occurring questions\n\nInteract with the server\n\nThis learn-as-you-go resource will help users of all levels exploit MySQL more fully.

But it has its shortcomings such as lack of support for SEO friendly server-side rendering and being too prescriptive by being a framework.\nFacebook's React is a technology that competes indirectly with AngularJS. It is not a full-fledged MVC framework. It is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces (in some sense the View part). Yet, it is possible to build a web app by replacing AngularJS with React – hence the term MERN stack.\nWhat You Will Learn\nDiscover the details of React, the React Way, and how to get the maximum out of this library\nSee the basics of MongoDB, Express, and Node, enough to build a web app\nWork with other tools complementary to React, including React-Bootstrap and React Router\nUse the tools required to build JavaScript based SPAs \nTie all the components together to build a complete web app.\nWho This Book Is ForDevelopers and architects who have prior experience in any web app stack other than the MERN stack will find the book useful to learn about this modern stack.

This is perhaps one of the most important issues facing our world today.\n\nUrban energy systems play a critical role in the sustainability and resilience of smart cities. As cities continue to grow and face increasing energy demands, it becomes essential to develop efficient and sustainable energy solutions. Modelling and simulation techniques provide valuable insights into the design, operation, and optimization of urban energy systems, supporting the transition towards more sustainable and smart cities. This perspective highlights the importance of modelling and simulation in achieving sustainable urban energy systems and their role in shaping smart cities.\n\nModelling and simulation play a crucial role in achieving sustainable urban energy systems and shaping smart cities. By integrating diverse energy systems, optimizing renewable energy integration, enabling demand-side management, supporting microgrid and storage system design, enhancing resilience, and facilitating policy evaluation, these tools empower decision-makers to develop and implement sustainable energy solutions. Embracing a modelling and simulation perspective in urban energy planning supports the transition towards more sustainable, efficient, and resilient smart cities that meet the energy needs of present and future generations.\n\nThis book uncovers the latest research in the field of urban energy sustainability and climate management. Urban energy sustainability and climate management have been employed successfully for various purposes like human-computer interaction, decision-making, recommender systems, and so on. Data analytics have supported these applications through various efficient and effective methods. Covering all of these topics, this is a “one-stop shop” for engineers, students, policymakers, scientists, and other industry professionals working with smart cities and urban energy systems. It is a must have for any library.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Engineering","Renewable Energy"]},{"id":"9781680505566","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Rails 5 Test Prescriptions","authors":["Noel Rappin"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"February 2018","description":"Does your Rails code suffer from bloat, brittleness, or inaccuracy?

And then, just like that, everything changed. A global pandemic. Social distancing. Working from home. In an instant, the tide became a tsunami.\n\nThe global pandemic accelerated the broad adoption of virtual instructor led training along with awareness that classroom-based training is often expensive, inefficient, and fails to deliver a fair return on investment. While it is certainly more challenging to re-create the collaborative environment of the physical classroom in a virtual setting, virtual training combines the structure, accountability, and social learning benefits of classroom training with speed, agility, and significant cost savings.\n\nSimply put, virtual training enables organizations to rapidly upskill more people, while generating a far higher return on the training investment. Virtual training is also green. Studies indicate that virtual training consumes nearly 90% less energy and produces 85% fewer CO2 emissions than classroom training.\n\nStill, the biggest challenge with virtual training, and the reason there has been so much resistance to it, is historically the experience has been excruciating. Not the quality of the curriculum or content. Not the talent of the trainer. The learning experience. There are few people who haven’t had the pleasure of sitting through agonizing virtual training sessions. Death by voice over PowerPoint, delivered by a disengaged instructor, has an especially bitter flavor.\n\nIt is the way virtual training is delivered that matters most.

First introduced by economists, fixed effects methods are gaining widespread use throughout the social sciences. Designed to eliminate major biases from regression models with multiple observations (usually longitudinal) for each subject (usually a person), fixed effects methods essentially offer control for all stable characteristics of the subjects, even characteristics that are difficult or impossible to measure. This straightforward and thorough text shows you how to estimate fixed effects models with several SAS procedures that are appropriate for different kinds of outcome variables. The theoretical background of each model is explained, and the models are then illustrated with detailed examples using real data. The book contains thorough discussions of the following uses of SAS procedures: PROC GLM for estimating fixed effects linear models for quantitative outcomes, PROC LOGISTIC for estimating fixed effects logistic regression models, PROC PHREG for estimating fixed effects Cox regression models for repeated event data, PROC GENMOD for estimating fixed effects Poisson regression models for count data, and PROC CALIS for estimating fixed effects structural equation models. To gain the most benefit from this book, readers should be familiar with multiple linear regression, have practical experience using multiple regression on real data, and be comfortable interpreting the output from a regression analysis.

Cognitive radio technology integrates computational intelligence into software-defined radio for embedded intelligent agents that adapt to RF environments and user needs. Using this technology, users can more fully exploit the radio spectrum and services available from wireless connectivity. For example, an attempt to send a 10MB e-mail in a zone where carrier charges are high might cause a cognitive radio to alert its user and suggest waiting until getting to the office to use the LAN instead. Cognitive Radio Architecture examines an \"ideal cognitive radio\" that features autonomous machine learning, computer vision, and spoken or written language perception.\n\nThe author of this exciting new book is the inventor of the technology and a leader in the field. Following his step-by-step introduction, readers can start building aware/adaptive radios and then make steps towards cognitive radio. After an introduction to adaptive, aware, and cognitive radio, the author develops three major themes in three sections:\n\nFoundations\n\nRadio Competence\n\nUser Domain Competence\n\nThe book makes the design principles of cognitive radio more accessible to students of teleinformatics, as well as to wireless communications systems developers. It therefore embraces the practice of cognitive radio as well as the theory. In particular, the publication develops a cognitive architecture that integrates disparate disciplines, including autonomous machine learning, computer vision, and language perception technologies. An accompanying CD-ROM contains the Java source code and compiled class files for applications developed in the book. In addition, for the convenience of the reader, Web resources introducing key concepts such as speech applications programmer interfaces (APIs) are included.\n\nAlthough still five to ten years away from full deployment, telecommunications giants and research labs around the world are already dedicating R&D to this new technology.

This section closely examines Spyware’s ongoing transformation from nuisance to malicious, sophisticated attack vector. Next, the book uncovers spyware’s intricate economy and network of malicious hackers and criminals. Forensic investigations presented in this section of the book reveal how increasingly sophisticated spyware can compromise enterprise networks via trojans, keystroke loggers, system monitoring, distributed denial of service attacks, backdoors, viruses, and worms. After close examination of these attack vectors, the book begins to detail both manual and automated techniques for scanning your network for the presence of spyware, and customizing your IDS and IPS to detect spyware. From here, the book goes on to detail how to prevent spyware from being initially installed to mitigating the damage inflicted by spyware should your network become infected. Techniques discussed in this section include slowing the exposure rate; web filtering; using FireFox, MacOSX, or Linux; patching and updating, machine restrictions, shielding, deploying anti-spyware, and re-imaging. The book concludes with an analysis of the future of spyware and what the security community must accomplish to win the ware against spyware.* A recent survey published by Information Security Magazine stated that \"combating spyare\" was the #2 priority for security professionals in 2005* Despite the high priority placed on combating spyware by security professionals, there are no other books published or announced that address this market * Author Paul Piccard is Director of Research for Webroot, which is a market leader for pure-play anti-spyware vendors","tags":["Security","Malware","Ransomware"]},{"id":"9780061738913","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Best Practices: Achieving Goals","authors":["Kathleen Schienle"],"pages":"144","publication_date":"October 2009","description":"Aiming high is essential to success.

Scientists and engineers have designed highly sophisticated robots, but most are still only able to operate and move in predetermined, planned environments designed specifically for the robots and typically at very high cost. This new book takes robotics to the next level by setting forth the theory and techniques needed to achieve robotic motion in unstructured environments. The ability to move and operate in an arbitrary, unplanned environment will lead to automating a wide range of new robotic tasks, such as patient care, toxic site cleanup, and planetary exploration.\n\nThe approach that opens the door for robots to handle unstructured tasks is known as Sensing-Intelligence-Motion (SIM), which draws from research in topology, computational complexity, control theory, and sensing hardware. Using SIM as an underlying foundation, the author's carefully structured presentation is designed to:\n\nFormulate the challenges of sensor-based motion planning and then build a theoretical foundation for sensor-based motion planning strategies\n\nInvestigate promising algorithmic strategies for mobile robots and robot arm manipulators, in both cases addressing motion planning for the whole robot body\n\nCompare robot performance to human performance in sensor-based motion planning to gain better insight into the challenges of SIM and help build synergistic human-robot teams for tele-operation tasks. It is both exciting and encouraging to discover that robot performance decisively exceeds human performance in certain tasks requiring spatial reasoning, even when compared to trained operators\n\nReview sensing hardware that is necessary to realize the SIM paradigm\n\nSome 200 illustrations, graphic sketches, and photos are included to clarify key issues, develop and validate motion planning approaches, and demonstrate full systems in operation.\n\nAs the first book fully devoted to robot motion planning in unstructured environments, Sensing, Intelligence, Motion is a must-read for engineers, scientists, and researchers involved in robotics. It will help them migrate robots from highly specialized applications in factories to widespread use in society where autonomous robot motion is needed.","tags":["Hardware","Internet of Things (IoT)","Robotics"]},{"id":"9781680500493","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Rails 4 Test Prescriptions","authors":["Noel Rappin"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"December 2014","description":"Does your Rails code suffer from bloat, brittleness, or inaccuracy?

Firmly established as a high-performance operating system, its worldwide installations are increasing at phenomenal rates. Much of this success has been on the server side, but more and more PC users are turning to Linux on the desktop, as well. For those grounded in Microsoft Windows® or Apple Macintosh® graphical interfaces, the first look at a powerful Unix-style operating system can be daunting. This book provides a clear, no-nonsense introduction to the popular Red Hat® distribution of Linux. It takes you through installation and shows you the key parts of the system, always with an eye toward what can go wrong and what you need to know to get over the humps. Linux is known as a secure environment and a good platform to run a web server. These topics are among the many covered in this book. But did you know you can also burn CDs, sync a PalmPilot™, and edit slideshow presentations with powerful tools on Linux? Those topics are covered here, too. Red Hat currently provides two distributions, both documented in this book. The first is their commercial, subscription-based product, called Red Hat Enterprise Linux and also available through retail channels as Red Hat Professional Workstation. The second is the freely distributed Fedora distribution. The Publisher's Edition of Fedora is included in this book on two disks. New in this edition are installation instructions for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora, package updating for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora, information on the GRUB bootloader, and the CUPS printer system. Learning Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora tells you how to:\n\nPrepare your system for installing Linux\n\nInstall and configure Linux and the two popular desktop environments, GNOME and KDE.\n\nRun the most popular productivity tools on Linux: mailers, web browsers, OpenOffice, and Evolution.\n\nObtain and set up software through the Red Hat Package Manager (RPM)\n\nSet up a Linux system for networking, either on your local area network (LAN), or via a dialup connection to the Internet.\n\nUse the system-administration tools included with Red Hat, GNOME, and KDE, including such valuable utilities as Samba file-sharing and the Apache web server.\n\nUnderstand and write shell scripts so you can peek under the hood and extend the power of Linux.","tags":["Software Development","Operating Systems","Linux","Red Hat","Fedora"]},{"id":"9780749464400","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Managing Successful Teams","authors":["Pat Wellington"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"June 2012","description":"Managing Successful Teams addresses the everyday issues faced by team managers and leaders.

Known as ``QP-unified motion planning and control of redundant manipulators'' theory, it systematically solves difficult optimization problems of inequality-constrained motion planning and control of redundant manipulators that have plagued robotics engineers and systems designers for more than a quarter century.    \n\nAn example of redundancy resolution could involve a robotic limb with six joints, or degrees of freedom (DOFs), with which to position an object. As only five numbers are required to specify the position and orientation of the object, the robot can move with one remaining DOF through practically infinite poses while performing a specified task. In this case redundancy resolution refers to the process of choosing an optimal pose from among that infinite set. A critical issue in robotic systems control, the redundancy resolution problem has been widely studied for decades, and numerous solutions have been proposed. This book investigates various approaches to motion planning and control of redundant robot manipulators and describes the most successful strategy thus far developed for resolving redundancy resolution problems. \n\nProvides a fully connected, systematic, methodological, consecutive, and easy approach to solving redundancy resolution problems\nDescribes a new approach to the time-varying Jacobian matrix pseudoinversion, applied to the redundant-manipulator kinematic control\nIntroduces The QP-based unification of robots' redundancy resolution\nIllustrates the effectiveness of the methods presented using a large number of computer simulation results based on PUMA560, PA10, and planar robot manipulators\nProvides technical details for all schemes and solvers presented, for readers to adopt and customize them for specific industrial applications \n\nRobot Manipulator Redundancy Resolution is must-reading for advanced undergraduates and graduate students of robotics, mechatronics, mechanical engineering, tracking control, neural dynamics/neural networks, numerical algorithms, computation and optimization, simulation and modelling, analog, and digital circuits.

Internet-connected smart devices to regulate and save energy are certainly part of the picture, but as this comprehensive O’Reilly report explains, the key piece is the emergence of reliable energy-storage solutions. Today, people can outfit their homes, factories, and offices with rechargeable lithium-ion batteries from Tesla and other companies to store energy from any power source.\n\nAuthor Darren Beck describes how energy storage changes the game for renewable energy, which up until now has been a niche player because of its intermittent supply. Homeowners and businesses will be able to produce their own clean energy and share it on the grid. It’s the beginning, Beck says, of decentralized energy production that can not only reduce the use of fossil fuels—drastically—but also set up a vast network of distributed storage. And it’s coming sooner rather than later.\n\nDownload this report to learn:\n\nWhy Tesla has spurred interest in energy storage—and why the company open-sourced its patents for the technology\nWhat a network of distributed storage will look like\nHow smart meters can track energy demand across the grid in real time\nHow peer-to-peer business models can be used in a sharing economy for energy\nWhy owners of multi-tenant properties can set up micro virtual utilities\nHow consumers can store electricity when the cleanest energy choices come online\n\nDarren Beck has more 25 years of combined experience in business development, strategy, technology, and sustainability. In addition to writing about green practices in IoT for O’Reilly Media, Darren serves as Director of Environmental Initiatives for Sprint, and is as an Advisory Board Member for DaVinci Global, an organization designed to be the world’s leading source of insights into nature-inspired design for innovation, business, and finance.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Engineering","Renewable Energy"]},{"id":"9781484200674","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Beginning Fedora Desktop: Fedora 20 Edition","authors":["Richard Petersen"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"June 2014","description":"\"\n\nBeginning Fedora Desktop: Fedora 20 Edition is a complete guide to using the Fedora 20 Desktop Linux release as your daily driver for multimedia, productivity, social networking, the GNOME 3 desktop, administrative tasks, and more.

Arduinos can be expanded to have network capabilities with a variety of “shields,” all of which increase the cost and complexity of the system. By contrast, Raspberry Pis all run Linux, which is a very network-competent platform. The newest Pi, the Raspberry Pi Zero W,  is WiFi and Bluetooth capable, and costs around $10 U.S. For network enabled gadgets, it makes far more sense to cross to the Raspberry PI platform, if only someone would make it easy to do. That's what this book is about.\nYou'll learn some survival level Linux system administration, so you know how to set the machine up and how to establish at least minimal security for your gadget.  You''ll set up and learn the Geany IDE on your Pi, which is fairly similar to the Arduino IDE. \nWhere the two platforms overlap the most is the GPIO system. You'll see that several projects use and explain the WiringPi system. This is is deliberately similar to the Arduino's 'Wiring' functionality, which is how sketches interact with GPIO pins. You'll learn the differences between the GPIO pins of the two devices, and how the Pi has some limitations on those pins that the Arduino does not. As a final project, in an effort to escape some of those limitations, you'll attach an AtMEGA 328P to the Raspberry Pi and configure it as a real, 8MHz Arduino with the Arduino IDE running on the Pi, and learn how to have the two platforms communicate, giving you the best of both worlds.\nWhat You'll Learn\nEstablish security with Linux system administration\nSet up the Apache webserver\nWrite CGI programs so other computers can connect to your Pi and pull datain from it. \nUse C/C++ from Arduino sketches to write programs for the Pi   \nWho This Book Is For \nThe Arduino user who's been through all the tutorials and is comfortable writing sketches and connecting hardware to their Arduino.","tags":["Hardware","Internet of Things (IoT)","Single Board Computers","Raspberry Pi"]},{"id":"9780735621053","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Inside Microsoft® SQL Server™ 2005, Fourth Edition","authors":["Kalen Delaney"],"pages":"464","publication_date":"October 2006","description":"This practical, hands-on book offers deep, thorough coverage of the internals of architecture and resource management in SQL Server 2005, focusing on the Storage Engine.

It's become increasingly clear that the core source behind these innovative solutions is data.\n\nPolyglot persistence refers to systems that provide many different types of data storage technologies to deal with this vast variability of data. Applications that need to access data from more than one store have to navigate an array of databases in a complex—and ultimately unsustainable—maze. One solution to this problem is readily available.\n\nIn this ebook, consultant Joel Ruisi explains how a multi-model database enables you to take advantage of many different types of data models (and multiple schemas) in a single backend. With a multi-model database, companies can easily centralize, manage, and search all the data the IT system collects. The result is data agility: the ability to adapt to changing environments and serve users what they need when they need it.\n\nThrough several detailed use cases, this ebook explains how multi-model databases enable you to:\n\nStore and manage multiple heterogeneous data sources\nConsolidate your data by bringing everything in \"as is\"\nInvisibly extend model features from one model to another\nTake a hybrid approach to analytical and operational data\nEnhance user search experience, including big data search\nConduct queries across data models\nOffer SQL without relational constraints","tags":["Data","Data Engineering","Relational Databases"]},{"id":"53863MIT55217","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Raising the Bar With Analytics","authors":["Renee Boucher Ferguson","Pamela Kirk Prentice","David Kiron"],"pages":"5","publication_date":"January 2014","description":"A majority of managers see the importance of increasing the use of analytics in decision making, according to a recent survey of 2,037 managers conducted by MIT Sloan Management Review, in partnership with SAS Institute. More than half of this year’s survey respondents strongly agree that their organization needs to step up the use of analytics to make better business decisions — and that percentage rises to 87% if respondents who agree “somewhat” are included. This finding — that a majority of survey respondents agree strongly about the need to step up analytics use — holds true across a range of industries. Several forces, the authors argue, are helping spur managers’ interest in analytics, including increased market complexity (for example, omnichannel retailing that encompasses both digital and brick-and-mortar channels) and the availability of better analytics tools and data. The authors report that some companies are sharing their data and analytics with business partners in order to meet strategic business objectives. For example, WellPoint, a U.S. health insurer based in Indianapolis, Indiana, is using analytics to help forge a payment model with physicians that rewards providers when they reduce overall health-care costs and enhance quality and health outcomes. Specifically, WellPoint is converting administrative claims and authorization data into useful information about populations of patients and sharing that information with physicians and their care teams. The survey data suggests that companies for which analytics has improved the ability to innovate are more likely to share data with partners and suppliers. Half of this year’s survey respondents somewhat or strongly agree that analytics is helping their organization innovate — and 16% believe that strongly. Those survey respondents who strongly agree that analytics is helping their organization innovate are much more likely to say they collaborate with partners and suppliers through the use of analytics than respondents who don’t think that analytics is helping their company innovate. The authors conclude that as companies use analytics to improve their ability to innovate, they also tend to collaborate more through their use of analytics: Analytics becomes an important medium through which organizations interact with both internal and external stakeholders. Thus, organizations that innovate thanks to analytics don’t merely increase their use of analytics in decision making; they also change the way they behave as organizations.","tags":["Data","Data Engineering","Streaming & Messaging","Real-Time Analytics"]},{"id":"9781118461945","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"QuickBooks 2013 All-in-One For Dummies","authors":["Stephen L.

Bring all the power of Microsoft .NET to bear on your data integration and ETL processes, and for no added cost over what you’ve already spent on licensing SQL Server. If you already have a license for SQL Server, then you do not need to spend more money to extend SSIS with custom tasks and components. \nWhy are custom components necessary? Because even though the SSIS catalog of built-in tasks and components is a marvel of engineering, there do remain gaps in the functionality that is provided. These gaps are especially relevant to enterprises practicing Data Integration Lifecycle Management (DILMS) and/or DevOps. \nOne of the gaps is a limitation of the SSIS Execute Package task. Developers using the stock version of that task are unable to select SSIS packages from other projects. Yet it’s useful to be able to select and execute tasks across projects, and the example used throughout this book will help you to create an Execute Catalog Package task that does in fact allow you to execute a task from another project. Building on the example’s pattern, you can create any task that you like, custom tailored to your specific, data integration and ETL needs.\nWhat You Will Learn\nConfigure and execute Visual Studio in the way that best supports SSIS task development\nCreate a class library as the basis for an SSIS task, and reference the needed SSIS assemblies\nProperly sign assemblies that you create in order to invoke them from your task\nImplement source code control via Visual Studio Team Services, or your own favorite tool set\nCode not only your tasks themselves, but also the associated task editors\nTroubleshoot and then execute your custom tasks as part of your own project\nWho This Book Is For\nDatabase administrators and developers who are involved in ETL projects built around SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS).

For such applications, the crucial bottleneck in the engineering process tends to shift from physical boundaries to controller generation. As an attempt to automatize this process, Evolutionary Robotics has successfully been used to generate robotic controllers of various types. However, a major challenge of the field remains the evolution of truly complex behavior. Furthermore, automatically created controllers often lack analyzability which makes them useless for safety-critical applications. In this book, a simple controller model based on Finite State Machines is proposed which allows a straightforward analysis of evolved behaviors. To increase the model's evolvability, a procedure is introduced which, by adapting the genotype-phenotype mapping at runtime, efficiently traverses both the behavioral search space as well as (recursively) the search space of genotype-phenotype mappings. Furthermore, a data-driven mathematical framework is proposed which can be used to calculate the expected success of evolution in complex environments.","tags":["Hardware","Internet of Things (IoT)","Robotics"]},{"id":"9781439873137","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Compound Semiconductor Radiation Detectors","authors":["Alan Owens"],"pages":"567","publication_date":"April 2016","description":"For many applications, compound semiconductors are now viable competitors to elemental semiconductors because of their wide range of physical properties.

However, that work generally results in a static graphic of the page, which has to be translated by a developer into the components of a Web page: HTML files and Web-compatible image files.\n\nOur multi-device world has shown us that this approach to web design, including full-page comps done in Photoshop, is increasingly problematic. Modern web designers are adopting a new approach: creating flexible web pages whose layout can adapt to suit the screen on which they are displayed. This is “Responsive Web Design” [RWD].\n\nUntil now, books on designing responsive Web sites have focused on HTML and CSS – in other words, they've been very code-centric, and visual creativity seems to take a back seat.\n\nThis new book is aimed at the visual Web designer who’s accustomed to working in Photoshop. Adobe Photoshop CC contains many new features that help streamline the process of converting a static page design to a set of components for a responsive web page.\n\nDan Rose is one of the best-known advocates of this new way of working in Photoshop. He’s observed that only a few people are talking about Photoshop for RWD constructively, yet a majority (63% as of his last informal poll) of web designers are using Photoshop for more than simple asset creation. This transition is a pain point for many designers.\n\nHis new book will balance coverage of conceptual issues (how to fit tools like Photoshop to the design workflow rather than fitting a workflow to the tools) with practical design exercises tailored to help communicate the overall design direction of the page while respecting the needs of the fluid Web. In addition, he will introduce methods for taking HTML back into Photoshop for further refinement.","tags":["Design","Product Design","Web Design","Responsive Web Design"]},{"id":"9780738440897","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Modernize Your IBM DB2 for IBM z/OS Maintenance with Utility Autonomics","authors":["Dean Brown","Carlos Gomes","Arthur Marais"],"pages":"152","publication_date":"August 2015","description":"IBM® DB2® for IBM z/OS® helps lower the cost of managing data by automating administration, increasing storage efficiency, improving performance, and simplifying the deployment of virtual appliances.

But by recognizing and resisting the small, seemingly inconsequential ways we make moral compromises in our own lives, we can repair the tear in our social and moral fabric.The Law of Small Things begins with an IQ (Integrity Quotient) test designed to reveal the casual way we regard our promises and the misconceptions we have about acting truthfully. The book shows how most people believe that integrity is something we “just have” and that we just do, like a Nike commercial. It depicts these and other deceptions we deploy to appear to act with integrity without actually doing so. The Law of Small Things also exposes how our culture encourages breaches of integrity through an array of “permitted promise-breaking,” a language of clichés that equates self-interest with duty, and the “illusion of inconsequence” that excuses small breaches with the breezy confidence that we can fulfill integrity when it counts. Brody challenges the prevailing notion that integrity is a possession you hold permanently. No one “has integrity” and no one is perfect in practicing it. What we have is the opportunity to uphold promises and fulfill duties in each situation that faces us, large and small. Integrity is a practice and a habit of keeping promises, the ones we make explicitly and the ones that are implied in all our relationships.

This technology is important because it offers you an attractive alternative to vertical growth by adding new z/VM systems. In the past, this capability required duplicate efforts to install, maintain, and manage each system. With SSI, these duplicate efforts are reduced or eliminated.\n\nSupport for live guest relocation (LGR) allows you to move Linux virtual servers without disrupting your business or incurring loss of service, thus reducing planned outages. The z/VM systems are aware of each other and take advantage of their combined resources. LGR enables you to relocate guests from a system requiring maintenance to a system that will remain active during maintenance.\n\nA major advantage for DB2 v10 customers is that using z/VM 6.2 does not require any changes to existing DB2 structures. This remarkable benefit is due to the fact that DB2 v10 is installed as part of the LInux guest on z/VM and is fully integrated into LGR. This allows you to smoothly move DB2 v10 when you move Linux virtual servers, without interrupting either DB2 v10 or z/VM operations and services.\n\nThis IBM Redbooks® publication will help you understand how DB2 10 on Linux for System z® behaves while running on a z/VM that is being relocated using z/VM’s 6.2 Live Guest Relocation feature.\n\nIn this book, we explore memory management, the DB2 Self-tuning memory manager feature, time synchronization, networking, and storage and performance considerations with regards to relocation. We also offer some best practices found during a live guest relocation for DB2 v10.","tags":["Data","Data Engineering","Relational Databases","IBM DB2"]},{"id":"9780415839945","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Future of Broadcasting","authors":["Social Morality Social Morality Council"],"pages":"100","publication_date":"June 2013","description":"At the time when this book was originally published, broadcasting in Britain had become a huge industry undergoing major changes.

The LLM probably knows nothing about it and may even make up a response. Retrieval Augmented Generation is an approach that solves this class of problems. The model first retrieves the most relevant pieces of information from your knowledge stores (search index, vector database, or a set of documents) and then generates its answer using the user’s prompt and the retrieved material as context. This avoids hallucination and lets you decide what it says.About the BookA Simple Guide to Retrieval Augmented Generation is a plain-English guide to RAG. The book is easy to follow and packed with realistic Python code examples. It takes you concept-by-concept from your first steps with RAG to advanced approaches, exploring how tools like LangChain and Python libraries make RAG easy.

With WebRTC, you'll create real-time applications to stream any kind of user media and data directly from one browser to another, all built on familiar HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Power real-time activities like text-based chats, secure peer-to-peer file transfers, collaborative brainstorming sessions - even multiplayer gaming. And you're not limited to two connected users: an entire chapter of the book is devoted to engineering multipeer WebRTC apps that let groups of people communicate in real time. You'll create your own video conferencing app. It's all here.\n\nWebRTC is an API exposed in all modern web browsers. After almost a decade of development, the WebRTC specification was finalized, and this book provides faithful coverage of that finalized specification. You'll start by building a basic but complete WebRTC application for video chatting. Chapter by chapter, you'll refine that app and its core logic to spin up new and exciting WebRTC-powered apps that will have your users sharing all manner of data with one another, all in real time. No third-party libraries or heavy downloads are required for you or your users: you'll be writing and strengthening your knowledge of vanilla JavaScript and native browser APIs.\n\nYou'll learn how to directly connect multiple browsers over the open internet using a signaling channel. You will gain familiarity with a whole set of Web APIs whose features bring WebRTC to life: requesting access to users' cameras and microphones; accessing and manipulating arbitrary user files, right in the browser; and web storage for persisting shared data over the life of a WebRTC call. Like any Web API, WebRTC doesn't enjoy a perfect implementation in any browser. But this book will guide you in writing elegant code to the specification, with backward-compatible fallback code for use in almost all modern browsers.\n\nUse WebRTC to build the next generation of web applications that stream media and data in real time, directly from one user to another - all by working in the browser.\n\nWhat You Need:\n\nReaders need a text editor, an up-to-date copy of Chrome or Firefox, and a POSIX-style command-line shell.

The material will benefit those who want a better high-level understanding of databases such as proposal managers, architects, project managers, and even customers. The material will also benefit those who will actually design, build, and work with databases such as database designers, database administrators, and programmers. In many projects, these roles overlap so the same person may be responsible for working on the proposal, managing part of the project, and designing and creating the database.\n\nThis book is aimed at IT professionals and students of all experience levels. It does not assume that you have any previous experience with databases or programs that use them. It doesn't even assume that you have experience with computers. All you really need is a willingness and desire to learn.\n\nThis book explains database design. It tells how to plan a database's structure so the database will be robust, resistant to errors, and flexible enough to accommodate a reasonable amount of future change. It explains how to discover database requirements, build data models to study data needs, and refine those models to improve the database's effectiveness.\n\nThe book solidifies these concepts by working through a detailed example that designs a realistic database. Later chapters explain how to actually build databases using two common database products: Access 2007 and MySQL.\n\nThe book finishes by describing some of the topics you need to understand to keep a database running effectively such as database maintenance and security.\n\nThis book explains database design. It tells how to determine what should go in a database and how the database should be structured to give the best results.\n\nThis book does not focus on actually creating the database. The details of database construction are different for different database tools so, to remain as generally as useful as possible, this book doesn't concentrate on any particular database system. You can apply the techniques described here equally to whatever database tool you use whether it's Access, SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, or some other database product.\n\nMost database products include free editions that you can use for smaller projects. For example, SQL Server Express Edition, Oracle Express Edition, and MySQL Community Server are all free.\n\nTo remain database neutral, the book does not assume you are using a particular database so you don't need any particular software or hardware. To work through the Exercises, all you really need is a pencil and some paper. You are welcome to type solutions into your computer if you like but you may actually find working with pencil and paper easier than using a graphical design tool to draw pictures, at least until you are comfortable with database design and are ready to pick a computerized design tool.\n\n\"Goals of Effective Database Design,\" explains the reasons why people and organizations use databases. It explains a database's purpose and conditions that it must satisfy to be useful. This also describes the basic ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) and CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) features that any good database should have. It explains in high-level general terms what makes a good database and what makes a bad database.\n\n\"Database Types,\" explains some of the different types of databases that you might decide to use. These include flat files, spreadsheets, hierarchical databases (XML), object databases, and relational databases. The relational database is one of the most powerful and most commonly used forms of database so it is the focus of this book, but it is important to realize that there are alternatives that may be more appropriate under certain circumstances. This gives some tips on deciding which kind of database might be best for a particular project.\n\n\"Relational Database Fundamentals,\" explains basic relational database concepts such as tables, rows, and columns. It explains the common usage of relational database terms in addition to the more technical terms that are sometimes used by database theorists. It describes different kinds of constraints that databases use to guarantee that the data is stored safely and consistently.\n\n\"Understanding User Needs,\" explains how to learn about the users' needs and gather user requirements. It tells how to study the users' current operations, existing databases (if any), and desired improvements. It describes common questions that you can ask to learn about users' operations, desires, and needs, and how to build the results into requirements documents and specifications. This explains what use cases are and tells how to use them and the requirements to guide database design and to measure success.\n\n\"Translating User Needs into Data Models,\" introduces data modeling. It explains how to translate the user's conceptual model and the requirements into other more precise models that define the database design rigorously. This describes several database modeling techniques including user-interface models, semantic object models, entity-relationship diagrams, and relational models.\n\n\"Extracting Business Rules,\" explains how a database can handle business rules. It explains what business rules are, how they differ from database structure requirements, and how you can identify business rules. This explains the benefits of separating business rules from the database structure and tells how achieve that separation.\n\n\"Normalizing Data,\" explains one of the biggest tools in database design: normalization. Normalization techniques allow you to restructure a database to increase its flexibility and make it more robust. This explains the various forms of normalization, emphasizing the stages that are most common and important: first, second, and third normal forms (1NF, 2NF, and 3NF). It explains how each of these kinds of normalization helps prevent errors and tells why it is sometimes better to leave a database slightly less normalized to improve performance.\n\n\"Designing Databases to Support Software Applications,\" explains how databases fit into the larger context of application design and lifecycle. This explains how later development depends on the underlying database design. It discusses multi-tier architectures that can help decouple the application and database design so there can be at least some changes to either without requiring changes to the other.\n\n\"Common Design Patterns,\" explains some common patterns that are useful in many applications. Some of these techniques include implementing various kinds of relationships among objects, storing hierarchical and network data, recording temporal data, and logging and locking.\n\n\"Common Design Pitfalls,\" explains some common design mistakes that occur in database development. It describes problems that can arise from insufficient planning, incorrect normalization, and obsession with ID fields and performance.\n\n\"User Needs and Requirements,\" walks through the steps required to analyze the users' problem, define requirements, and create use cases. It describes interviews with fictitious customers that are used to identify the application's needs and translate them into database requirements.\n\n\"Building a Data Model,\" translates the requirements gathered in the previous into a series of data models that precisely define the database's structure. This builds user-interface models, entity-relationship diagrams, semantic object models, and relational models to refine the database's initial design. The final relational models match the structure of a relational database fairly closely so they are easy to implement.\n\n\"Extracting Business Rules,\" identifies the business rules embedded in the relational model. It shows how to extract those rules in order to separate them logically from the database's structure. This makes the database more robust in the face of future changes to the business rules.\n\n\"Normalization and Refinement,\" refines the relational model by normalizing it. It walks through several versions of the database that are in different normal forms. It then selects the degree of normalization that provides a reasonable tradeoff between robust design and acceptable performance.\n\n\"Microsoft Access,\" explains how to build a database with Microsoft Access 2007. This explains enough to get started and to use Access to build non-trivial databases. You can use other versions of Access to work through this, although the locations of menus, buttons, and other Access features are different in different versions.\n\n\"MySQL,\" explains how to build a database with MySQL. This tells where to download a free version of MySQL. It explains how to use the MySQL Command Line Client as well as some useful graphical tools including MySQL Query Browser and MySQL Workbench.\n\n\"Introduction to SQL,\" provides an introduction to SQL (Structured Query Language). It explains how to use SQL commands to add, insert, update, and delete data. By using SQL, you can help insulate a program from the idiosyncrasies of the particular database product that it uses to store data.\n\n\"Building Databases with SQL Scripts,\" explains how to use SQL scripts to build a database. It explains the advantages of this technique, such as the ability to create scripts to initialize a database before performing tests. It also explains some of the restrictions on this method, such as the fact that the user must create and delete tables in specific orders to satisfy table relationships.\n\n\"Database Maintenance,\" describes some of the database maintenance issues that are part of any database application. Though performing and restoring backups, compressing tables, rebuilding indexes, and populating data warehouses are strictly not database design tasks, they are essential to any working application.\n\n\"Database Security,\" explains database security issues. It explains the kinds of security that some database products provide. It also explains some additional techniques that can enhance database security such as using database views to appropriately restrict the users' access to data.","tags":["Data","Data Engineering","Relational Databases"]},{"id":"9781000557374","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Remote Working","authors":["Alan Felstead"],"pages":"136","publication_date":"January 2022","description":"The coronavirus pandemic forced work back into the home on a massive scale.

He clearly explains each idea, making a wealth of experience available to Ruby developers for their own daily work.\"\n\n—Steve Metsker, Managing Consultant with Dominion Digital, Inc.\n\n\"This book provides a great demonstration of the key 'Gang of Four' design patterns without resorting to overly technical explanations. Written in a precise, yet almost informal style, this book covers enough ground that even those without prior exposure to design patterns will soon feel confident applying them using Ruby. Olsen has done a great job to make a book about a classically 'dry' subject into such an engaging and even occasionally humorous read.\"\n\n—Peter Cooper\n\n\"This book renewed my interest in understanding patterns after a decade of good intentions. Russ picked the most useful patterns for Ruby and introduced them in a straightforward and logical manner, going beyond the GoF's patterns. This book has improved my use of Ruby, and encouraged me to blow off the dust covering the GoF book.\"\n\n—Mike Stok\n\n\"Design Patterns in Ruby is a great way for programmers from statically typed objectoriented languages to learn how design patterns appear in a more dynamic, flexible language like Ruby.\"\n\n—Rob Sanheim, Ruby Ninja, Relevance\n\nMost design pattern books are based on C++ and Java. But Ruby is different—and the language's unique qualities make design patterns easier to implement and use. In this book, Russ Olsen demonstrates how to combine Ruby's power and elegance with patterns, and write more sophisticated, effective software with far fewer lines of code.\n\nAfter reviewing the history, concepts, and goals of design patterns, Olsen offers a quick tour of the Ruby language—enough to allow any experienced software developer to immediately utilize patterns with Ruby. The book especially calls attention to Ruby features that simplify the use of patterns, including dynamic typing, code closures, and \"mixins\" for easier code reuse.\n\nFourteen of the classic \"Gang of Four\" patterns are considered from the Ruby point of view, explaining what problems each pattern solves, discussing whether traditional implementations make sense in the Ruby environment, and introducing Ruby-specific improvements. You'll discover opportunities to implement patterns in just one or two lines of code, instead of the endlessly repeated boilerplate that conventional languages often require.\n\nDesign Patterns in Ruby also identifies innovative new patterns that have emerged from the Ruby community. These include ways to create custom objects with metaprogramming, as well as the ambitious Rails-based \"Convention Over Configuration\" pattern, designed to help integrate entire applications and frameworks.\n\nEngaging, practical, and accessible, Design Patterns in Ruby will help you build better software while making your Ruby programming experience more rewarding.","tags":["Software Development","Programming Languages","Ruby"]},{"id":"9781492075523","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Refactoring at Scale","authors":["Maude Lemaire"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"October 2020","description":"Making significant changes to large, complex codebases is a daunting task--one that's nearly impossible to do successfully unless you have the right team, tools, and mindset.

Refactoring-the art of improving the design of existing code safely-provides an efficient, reliable system for bringing order to the chaos, and one that keeps the surprises to a minimum! Refactoring can be difficult to learn, but Refactoring Workbook, by consultant William C. Wake, presents the material in a easy-learning format that makes learning enjoyable and effective.\n\nFor many, the obstacle to learning refactoring is in identifying the \"smells\"—the potential problem areas-found in code. Instead of having you read about the smells, Refactoring Workbook makes sure you understand them. You'll solve a carefully assembled series of problems, and you'll find yourself learning at a deeper level and arriving at a few insights of your own. Wake uses the workbook method—a learning-focused approach that forces you to apply the techniques presented in the book-in the rest of the book. This approach helps you learn and apply the most important refactoring techniques to your code and, as a side benefit, helps you to think more about creating great code even when you're not refactoring.\n\nRefactoring Workbook provides user-friendly references such as:\n\nA handy, quick-reference \"smell finder\"\n\nA standard format for describing smells\n\nAppendices showing key refactorings\n\nA listing of Java™ tools that support refactoring\n\nThis book is intended for programmers with a knowledge of Java, though a C# or C++ programmer with a basic understanding of Java would also be able to follow and learn from the examples.

These smells tend to contribute heavily to technical debt – further time owed to fix projects thought to be complete – and need to be addressed via proper refactoring.Refactoring for Software Design Smells presents 25 structural design smells, their role in identifying design issues, and potential refactoring solutions. Organized across common areas of software design, each smell is presented with diagrams and examples illustrating the poor design practices and the problems that result, creating a catalog of nuggets of readily usable information that developers or engineers can apply in their projects.

Mike’s approach whilst simple is completely professional, and I can recommend this book to any novice database designer.”\n\n     –Sandra Barker, Lecturer, University of South Australia, Australia\n\n“Databases are a critical infrastructure technology for information systems and today’s business. Mike Hernandez has written a literate explanation of database technology–a topic that is intricate and often obscure. If you design databases yourself, this book will educate you about pitfalls and show you what to do. If you purchase products that use a database, the book explains the technology so that you can understand what the vendor is doing and assess their products better.”\n\n     –Michael Blaha, consultant and trainer, author of A Manager’s Guide to Database Technology\n\n“If you told me that Mike Hernandez could improve on the first edition of Database Design for Mere Mortals I wouldn’t have believed you, but he did! The second edition is packed with more real-world examples, detailed explanations, and even includes database-design tools on the CD-ROM! This is a must-read for anyone who is even remotely interested in relational database design, from the individual who is called upon occasionally to create a useful tool at work, to the seasoned professional who wants to brush up on the fundamentals. Simply put, if you want to do it right, read this book!”\n\n     –Matt Greer, Process Control Development, The Dow Chemical Company\n\n“Mike’s approach to database design is totally common-sense based, yet he’s adhered to all the rules of good relational database design.

Whether you’re just getting started developing with data or are a seasoned pro; whether you've read Mike’s previous book or this is your first; whether you're happier letting someone else design your data or you love doing it yourself–this is the book for you. Mike’s ability to explain these concepts in a way that’s not only clear, but fun, continues to amaze me.”\n\n     –From the Foreword by Ken Getz, MCW Technologies, coauthor ASP.NET Developer's JumpStart\n\n“The first edition of Mike Hernandez’s book Database Design for Mere Mortals was one of the few books that survived the cut when I moved my office to smaller quarters. The second edition expands and improves on the original in so many ways. It is not only a good, clear read, but contains a remarkable quantity of clear, concise thinking on a very complex subject. It’s a must for anyone interested in the subject of database design.”\n\n     –Malcolm C. Rubel, Performance Dynamics Associates\n\n“Mike’s excellent guide to relational database design deserves a second edition. His book is an essential tool for fledgling Microsoft Access and other desktop database developers, as well as for client/server pros. I recommend it highly to all my readers.”\n\n     –Roger Jennings, author of Special Edition Using Access 2002\n\n“There are no silver bullets! Database technology has advanced dramatically, the newest crop of database servers perform operations faster than anyone could have imagined six years ago, but none of these technological advances will help fix a bad database design, or capture data that you forgot to include!

As an advanced mean regression analysis, each estimation equation of the mean-regression can be used directly to estimate the conditional quantile regression (QR), which can quickly present the statistical results of a set nine QR(τ)s for τ(tau)s from 0.1 up to 0.9 to predict detail distribution of the response or criterion variable. QR is an important analytical tool in many disciplines such as statistics, econometrics, ecology, healthcare, and engineering.\n\nQuantile Regression: Applications on Experimental and Cross Section Data Using EViews provides examples of statistical results of various QR analyses based on experimental and cross section data of a variety of regression models. The author covers the applications of one-way, two-way, and n-way ANOVA quantile regressions, QRs with multi numerical predictors, heterogeneous QRs, and latent variables QRs, amongst others.

In the book’s foreword, Peopleware authors Tom DeMarco and Timothy Lister rave, “We believe this is a book that needs to be on the desk of just about anyone who manages anything.”\n\nBecause people often react with unanticipated sophistication when they are being measured, measurement-based management systems can become dysfunctional, interfering with achievement of intended results. Fortunately, as the author shows, measurement dysfunction follows a pattern that can be identified and avoided.\n\nThe author’s findings are bolstered by interviews with eight recognized experts in the use of measurement to manage computer software development: David N. Card, of Software Productivity Solutions; Tom DeMarco, of the Atlantic Systems Guild; Capers Jones, of Software Productivity Research; John Musa, of AT&T Bell Laboratories; Daniel J.

The use of energy is strongly related to almost every conceivable aspect of development: wealth, health, nutrition, water, infrastructure, education and even life expectancy itself are strongly and significantly related to the consumption of energy per capita. Many development indicators are strongly related to per-capita energy consumption. Fossil fuel is the most conventional source of energy but also increases greenhouse gas emissions. The economic development of many countries has come at the cost of the environment. However, it should not be presumed that a reconciliation of the two is not possible.\n\nThe nexus concept is the interconnection between the resource energy, water, food, land, and climate. Such interconnections enable us to address trade-offs and seek synergies among them. Energy, water, food, land, and climate are essential resources of our natural environment and support our quality of life. Competition between these resources is increasing globally and is exacerbated by climate change. Improving resilience and securing resource availability would require improving resource efficiency. Many policies and programs are announced nationally and internationally for replacing the conventional mode and also emphasizing on conservation of fossil fuels and reuse of exhausted energy, so a gap in implications and outcomes can be broadly traced by comparing the data.\n\nThis book aims to highlight problems and solutions related to conventional energy utilization, formation, and multitudes of ecological impacts and tools for the conservation of fossil fuels. The book also discusses modern energy services as one of the sustainable development goals and how the pressure on resource energy disturbs the natural flows. The recent advances in alternative energy sources and their possible future growth are discussed and on how conventional energy leads to greenhouse gas formation, which reduces energy use efficiency. The different policies and models operating is also addressed, and the gaps that remained between them. Climate change poses a challenge for renewable energy, and thus it is essential to identify the factors that would reduce the possibility of relying on sustainable energy sources.\n\nThis book will be of interest to researchers and stakeholders, students, industries, NGOs, and governmental agencies directly or indirectly associated with energy research.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Engineering","Renewable Energy"]},{"id":"9781784392017","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server Cookbook","authors":["William Leemans"],"pages":"250","publication_date":"December 2015","description":"This book is your comprehensive guide to mastering Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Server.

Last year, US companies spent over $165 Billion on training; while many training programs themselves provide valuable skills and concepts, even the best-designed programs are ineffective because the learned behaviors are not reinforced. Without reinforcement, learned information gets shuffled to the back of the mind in the \"nice to know\" file, never again to see the light of day.

Brown III"],"pages":"287","publication_date":"March 2018","description":"This tutorial teaches you how to use the statistical programming language R to develop a business case simulation and analysis. It presents a methodology for conducting business case analysis that minimizes decision delay by focusing stakeholders on what matters most and suggests pathways for minimizing the risk in strategic and capital allocation decisions. Business case analysis, often conducted in spreadsheets, exposes decision makers to additional risks that arise just from the use of the spreadsheet environment.\n\nR has become one of the most widely used tools for reproducible quantitative analysis, and analysts fluent in this language are in high demand. The R language, traditionally used for statistical analysis, provides a more explicit, flexible, and extensible environment than spreadsheets for conducting business case analysis.\n\nThe main tutorial follows the case in which a chemical manufacturing company considers constructing a chemical reactor and production facility to bring a new compound to market. There are numerous uncertainties and risks involved, including the possibility that a competitor brings a similar product online. The company must determine the value of making the decision to move forward and where they might prioritize their attention to make a more informed and robust decision. While the example used is a chemical company, the analysis structure it presents can be applied to just about any business decision, from IT projects to new product development to commercial real estate. The supporting tutorials include the perspective of the founder of a professional service firm who wants to grow his business and a member of a strategic planning group in a biomedical device company who wants to know how much to budget in order to refine the quality of information about critical uncertainties that might affect the value of a chosen product development pathway.\n\nWhat You’ll Learn\n\nSet upa business case abstraction in an influence diagram to communicate the essence of the problem to other stakeholders\nModel the inherent uncertainties in the problem with Monte Carlo simulation using the R language\nCommunicate the results graphically\nDraw appropriate insights from the results\nDevelop creative decision strategies for thorough opportunity cost analysis\nCalculate the value of information on critical uncertainties between competing decision strategies to set the budget for deeper data analysis\nConstruct appropriate information to satisfy the parameters for the Monte Carlo simulation when little or no empirical data are available\n\nWho This Book Is For\n\nFinancial analysts, data practitioners, and risk/business professionals; also appropriate for graduate level finance, business, or data science students","tags":["Data","Data Science","Data Science Tools","R"]},{"id":"9781484260265","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Learn Rails 6: Accelerated Web Development with Ruby on Rails","authors":["Adam Notodikromo"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"October 2020","description":"Effectively learn and apply software development and engineering techniques to web application development using Rails 6 with this accelerated tutorial. This book teaches modern engineering practices including git flow, containerization, debugging, testing, and deployment.

RFID tags can be small adhesive stickers containing antennas that receive and respond to transmissions from RFID transmitters. RFID tags are used to identify and track everything from food, dogs, beer kegs to library books. RFID tags use a standard that has already been hacked by several researchers. RFID Security discusses the motives for someone wanting to hack an RFID system and shows how to protect systems. Coverage includes: security breaches for monetary gain (hacking a shops RFID system would allow a hacker to lower the pricing on any product products). How to protect the supply chain (malicous/mischievous hackers can delete/alter/modify all identifying information for an entire shipment of products). How to protect personal privacy (privacy advocates fear that RFID tags embedded in products, which continue to transmit information after leaving a store, will be used to track consumer habits).The purpose of an RFID system is to enable data to be transmitted by a portable device, called a tag, which is read by an RFID reader and processed according to the needs of a particular application. The data transmitted by the tag may provide identification or location information, or specifics about the product tagged, such as price, colour, date of purchase, etc. .* Deloitte & Touche expects over 10 billion RFID tags to be in circulation by the end of 2005 * Parties debating the security issue of RFID need information on the pros and cons of the technology and this is that information* Little competition in a market desperate for information","tags":["Hardware","Wireless Technology","Radio-frequency identification (RFID)"]},{"id":"9781492048428","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"What Is Database Design, Anyway?","authors":["C.J.

Each organization that uses her Performance Management Reboot is able to develop its own unique version since it doesn't make a lot of sense for organizations with different cultures, in different industries and sectors, to do things exactly the same way. Grounded in the latest scientific findings about motivation, it's a transparent, employee-driven process that values collaboration over competition and rewards people for acquiring new skills and increasing their contribution instead of hitting arbitrary benchmarks. Chandler lays out the general principles and then walks you through each step in creating a performance management process that employees will actually embrace rather than avoid and that will help you meet the three objectives of great performance management: developing your people, rewarding them equitably, and driving your organization's performance. It's the first comprehensive, step-by-step guide to creating a performance management solution that's tailored to your organization's needs and goals and that places the emphasis squarely on your greatest asset: your people.","tags":["Business","Human Resources","Reviews & Metrics","Performance Reviews"]},{"id":"9781118766712","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Raspberry Pi Projects For Dummies","authors":["Mike Cook","Jonathan Evans","Brock Craft"],"pages":"504","publication_date":"July 2015","description":"Join the Raspberry revolution with these fun and easy Pi projects\n\nThe Raspberry Pi has opened up a whole new world of innovation for everyone from hardware hackers and programmers to students, hobbyists, engineers, and beyond.

Typical sensors, such as Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers, cannot be used under the surface and other inertial systems suffer from a strong integration drift. On top of that, the seabed is generally uniform and unstructured, making it difficult to apply Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) methods to perform localization. Reliable Robot Localization presents an innovative new method which can be characterized as a raw-data SLAM approach. It differs from extant methods by considering time as a standard variable to be estimated, thus raising new opportunities for state estimation, so far underexploited. However, such temporal resolution is not straightforward and requires a set of theoretical tools in order to achieve the main purpose of localization. This book not only presents original contributions to the field of mobile robotics, it also offers new perspectives on constraint programming and set-membership approaches. It provides a reliable contractor programming framework in order to build solvers for dynamical systems. This set of tools is illustrated throughout this book with realistic robotic applications.","tags":["Hardware","Internet of Things (IoT)","Robotics"]},{"id":"9780133553208","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"QuickBooks® 2014 on Demand","authors":["Michelle L.

Emerging technologies, data analytics and automation open up new possibilities which have implications for energy generation, storage and energy demand. To support these changes we urgently need to rethink how energy will be sourced, shared and used. Yet existing approaches to this problem, driven by engineering, data analytics and capital, are dangerously conservative and entrenched.\n\nEnergy Futures critically evaluates this context, and the energy infrastructures, stakeholders, and politics that participate in it, to propose plausible, responsible and ethical modes of encountering possible energy futures. Imagining anthropocene challenges, emerging technologies and everyday life otherwise through empirically grounded studies, opens up possible energy futures.\n\nEnergy Futures proposes and demonstrates a new critical and interventional futures-oriented energy anthropology. Combining the theories and methods of futures anthropology with the critical expertise and perspectives of energy anthropology creates a powerful mode of engagement, which this book argues is needed to disrupt the dominant narratives about our energy futures. Its contributors collectively reveal and evidence through innovative ethnographic practice how new knowledge about imagined and possible energy futures can be mobilised in engagements with emerging technologies, anthropocene challenges and everyday realities.\n\nIn doing so it brings together authors, analytical expertise and ethnographic evidence from the global south, north and places in between, generated through innovative methodologies including remote video and comic strip methods and documentary video practice as well as long term fieldwork.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Engineering","Renewable Energy"]},{"id":"9781484201817","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Mastering the Raspberry Pi","authors":["Warren W.

While its roots are in Japan, Ruby is slowly but surely gaining ground in the US. The goal of Yukihiro Matsumoto, creator of Ruby and author of this book, is to incorporate the strengths of languages like Perl, Python, Lisp and Smalltalk. Ruby is a genuine attempt to combine the best of everything in the scripting world. Since 1993, Ruby mailing lists have been established, Web pages have formed, and a community has grown around it. The language itself is very good at text processing and is notable for its broad object orientation. Ruby is portable and runs under GNU/Linux (and other Unices) as well as DOS, MS Windows and Mac.With Ruby in a Nutshell, Matsumoto offers a practical reference to the features of this new language including the command-line options, syntax, built-in variables, functions, and many commonly used classes and modules. This guide covers the current stable version of Ruby (1.6), yet is applicable to the development version 1.7 and the next planned stable version 1.8. You will find a thorough description of Ruby's language syntax, and a description of the core functionality built into the standard Ruby interpreter, which has more than 800 built-in methods in 42 classes and modules.Ruby finds its power through its built-in libraries, and this handy volume take you through the many useful libraries that come with the standard Ruby distribution--from network access via HTTP and CGI programming, to data persistence using the DBM library. This book concludes with coverage of the unique tools that come with Ruby, including the debugger, profiler, and irb (or interactive ruby.)Find out how Ruby combines the strengths of other languages, and why it has captured the interest of so many open source programmers.

It is one of the most important topics of research in the area of mobile and personal communications. SDR is viewed as the enabler of global roaming and a platform for the introduction of new technologies and services into existing live networks. It therefore gives networks a greater flexibility into mobile communications. It bridges the inter-disciplinary gap in the field as SDR covers two areas of development, namely software development and digital signal processing and the internet. It extends well beyond the simple re-configuration of air interface parameters to cover the whole system from the network to service creation and application development. Reconfigurability entails the pervasive use of software reconfiguration, empowering upgrades or patching of any element of the network and of the services and applications running on it. It cuts across the types of bearer radio systems (Paging to cellular, wireless local area network to microwave, terrestrial to satellite, personal communications to broadcasting) enable the integration of many of today's disparate systems in the same hardware platform. Also it cuts across generation (second to third to fourth). This volume complements the already published volumes 1 and 2 of the Wiley Series in Software Radio. The book discusses the requirements for reconfigurability and then introduces network architectures and functions for reconfigurable terminals. Finally it deals with reconfiguration in the network. The book also provides a comprehensive view on reconfigurability in three very active research projects as CAST, MOBIVAS and TRUST/SCOUT.\n\nKey features include:\n\nPresents new research in wireless communications\n\nSummarises the results of an extensive research program on software defined radios in Europe\n\nProvides a comprehensive view on reconfigurability in three very active research projects as CAST (Configurable radio with Advanced Sodftware Technology), MOBIVAS (Downloadable MOBIle Value Added Services through Software Radio and Switching Integrated Platforms), TRUST (Transparently Re-configurable Ubiquitous Terminal) and SCOUT (Smart User-Centric Communciation Environment).","tags":["Hardware","Wireless Technology","Telecommunications","Radio"]},{"id":"9781118717035","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Learning Python with Raspberry Pi","authors":["Ben Everard","Alex Bradbury"],"pages":"286","publication_date":"March 2014","description":"The must-have companion guide to the Raspberry Pi User Guide!\n\nRaspberry Pi chose Python as its teaching language of choice to encourage a new generation of programmers to learn how to program.

Although few would characterize this technique as simple, regression is in fact both simple and elegant. The complexity that many attribute to regression analysis is often a reflection of their lack of familiarity with the language of mathematics. But regression analysis can be understood even without a mastery of sophisticated mathematical concepts. This book provides the foundation and will help demystify regression analysis using examples from economics and with real data to show the applications of the method. The concepts related to regression analysis are explained in a way that is comprehensible to those whose mathematical skills are not matching that of the expert level, and uses Microsoft Excel to obtain regression results. What hinders peoples’ comprehension of regression analysis is the difficulty many have in understanding mathematical symbols and derivations. By removing this obstacle, this book enables the logical reader to learn regression without possessing superior mathematical skills.","tags":["Data","Data Science","Data Science Tasks","Statistics","Regression Analysis"]},{"id":"9780240811864","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Radio Station, 8th Edition","authors":["Michael C Keith"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"September 2012","description":"This book is bible for beginning radio professionals: the complete, definitive guide to the internal workings of radio stations and the radio industry.

Glaciers have shrunk, ice on rivers and lakes is breaking up early, and plant and animal ranges have relocated. On a worldwide scale, the threat posed by climate change and pollution is obvious. A green and sustainable future necessitates using renewable resources to produce fuels, chemicals, and materials. This book investigates diverse bioprocesses that are crucial to everyday life, including the key concerns regarding the generation of biofuels, energy, and food securities, along with waste management. Commercial interest in biotechnological processes has risen to produce pharmaceuticals, health supplements, foodstuffs, biofuels, and chemicals using a biocatalyst such as enzymes, microorganisms, plant cells, or animal cells in a bioreactor. The sustainability of renewable biomass, replacement of depleted fossil fuels, and the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions from the existing chemical and oil industries are the key benefits of switching to bioproducts.\n\nThis book discusses bioprocessing to produce biofuels, biobased chemicals, bioproducts, and biomass biorefinery processes. This involves designing novel pretreatment and fractionation technologies for lignocellulose biomass into cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin and the conversion of these streams into biofuels and biobased chemicals via biochemical and thermochemical routes.

The book takes you to the leading edge of RIA development, presenting examples in Flex 3 and Rails 2.\n\nThis book is not an exhaustive Ruby on Rails tutorial, nor a Flex reference manual. (Adobe ships over 3000 pages of PDF reference documentation with Flex.) Instead, it's an extensive tutorial, developed iteratively, how to build an RIA using Flex and Rails together. You learn both the specific techniques you need to use Flex and Rails together as well as the development practices that make the combination especially powerful.\n\nThe example application built in the book is MIT-licensed, so readers can use it as the basis for their own applications. In fact, one reader has already built an agile project management tool based on the book example!\n\nAbout the Technology\n\nRails is a fantastic tool for web application development, but its Ajax-driven interfaces stop short of the richness you gain with a tool like Adobe Flex. Simply put, Flex is the most productive way to build the UI of rich Internet applications, and Rails is the most productive way to rapidly build a database-backed CRUD application. Together, they're an amazing combination.\n\nAbout the Book\n\nWith this book, you learn Flex by osmosis. You can read the book and follow along even if you have never used Flex before. Consider it \"Flex Immersion.\" You absorb the key concepts of Flex as you go through the process of building the application.\n\nYou will also learn how Flex and Rails integrate with HTTPService and XML, and see how RESTful Rails controller design gracefully supports using the same controller actions for Flex and HTML clients. The author will show you how Cairngorm can be used to architect larger Flex applications, including tips to use Cairngorm in a less verbose way with HTTPService to talk to Rails.\n\nWhat's Inside\nFlex 3 and Ruby on Rails 2 integrated with HTTPService and XML\nRESTful Rails controllers that support Flex and HTML clients\nCoverage of how to use Cairngorm to architect larger Flex applications\nA full application--not just a toy--developed and refactored iteratively\nAbout the Reader\n\nFlexible Rails is for both Rails developers who are interested in Flex, and Flex developers who are interested in Rails. For a Rails developer, Flex allows for more dynamic and engaging user interfaces than are possible with Ajax. For a Flex developer, Rails provides a way to rapidly build the ORM and services layer of the application.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nPeter Armstrong has been developing rich client applications for over 7 years. He worked with Flex full-time from July 2004 (since Flex 1.0) to October 2007 for a Silicon Valley startup, and was part of the team that won the 2006 Adobe MAX Award for RIA/Web Development. Before that, he was a Java Swing developer for over 4 years for another Silicon Valley startup. On the Rails side, Peter has been tracking Ruby on Rails since mid-2005 (since before Rails 1.0) and is the organizer of The Vancouver Ruby/Rails Meetup group. Peter is also a frequent speaker on using Flex and Rails together, including presentations at The Vancouver Flash/Flex Meetup, a RailsConf 2007 BOF, The Vancouver RIA Developer Camp and Rails to Italy in Pisa. Peter lives in the Vancouver, BC area and works as a Flex/AIR/Flash developer, writer (www.flexiblerails.com) and independent consultant (www.ruboss.com).\n\nQuotes... a first class learning experience that is tough to quantify but easy to qualify: Don't miss it.- Louis F.

Date"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"December 2012","description":"Views are virtual tables. That means they should be updatable, just as \"real\" or base tables are. In fact, view updatability isn’t just desirable, it’s crucial, for practical reasons as well as theoretical ones. But view updating has always been a controversial topic. Ever since the relational model first appeared, there has been widespread skepticism as to whether (in general) view updating is even possible.\n\nIn stark contrast to this conventional wisdom, this book shows how views, just like base tables, can always be updated (so long as the updates don’t violate any integrity constraints). More generally, it shows how updating always ought to work, regardless of whether the target is a base table or a view. The proposed scheme is 100% consistent with the relational model, but rather different from the way updating works in SQL products today.\n\nThis book can:\n\nHelp database products improve in the future\nHelp with a \"roll your own\" implementation, absent such product improvements\nMake you aware of the crucial role of predicates and constraints\nShow you how relational products are really supposed to behave\n\nAnyone with a professional interest in the relational model, relational technology, or database systems in general can benefit from this book.","tags":["Data","Data Engineering","Relational Databases"]},{"id":"9781098171391","language":"en","level":null,"title":"Writing a Regular Expression for Multiline Patterns","authors":["David Beazley"],"pages":"5","publication_date":"April 2024","description":"Build your knowledge of Python with this Shortcuts collection.

But there's nothing worse than an application that fails because it can't handle sudden success. Throughout this book, you'll work on an example enterprise project to learn first-hand what's involved in architecting serious web applications.\n\nWith this book, you will:\n\nTour an ideal enterprise systems layout: how Rails fits in, and which elements don't rely on Rails\nLearn to structure a Rails 2.0 application for complex websites\nDiscover how plugins can support reusable code and improve application clarity\nBuild a solid data model -- a fortress -- that protects your data from corruption\nBase an ActiveRecord model on a database view, and build support for multiple table inheritance\nExplore service-oriented architecture and web services with XML-RPC and REST\nSee how caching can be a dependable way to improve performance\n\nBuilding for scale requires more work up front, but you'll have a flexible website that can be extended easily when your needs change.

Data transformations are heavily used in all types of industries to provide information to various users at different levels. Depending on individual needs, the transformed data is stored in various different systems.\n\nSending operational data to other systems for further processing is then required, and introduces much complexity to an existing information technology (IT) infrastructure. Although maintenance of additional hardware and software is one component, potential inconsistencies and individually managed refresh cycles are others.\n\nFor decades, there was no simple and efficient way to perform data transformations on the source system of operational data. With IBM® DB2® Analytics Accelerator, DB2 for z/OS is now in a unique position to complete these transformations in an efficient and well-performing way. DB2 for z/OS completes these while connecting to the same platform as for operational transactions, helping you to minimize your efforts to manage existing IT infrastructure.\n\nReal-time analytics on incoming operational transactions is another demand. Creating a comprehensive scoring model to detect specific patterns inside your data can easily require multiple iterations and multiple hours to complete. By enabling a first set of analytical functionality in DB2 Analytics Accelerator, those dedicated mining algorithms can now be run on an accelerator to efficiently perform these modeling tasks.\n\nGiven the speed of query processing on an accelerator, these modeling tasks can now be performed much quicker compared to traditional relational database management systems. This speed enables you to keep your scoring algorithms more up-to-date, and ultimately adapt more quickly to constantly changing customer behaviors.\n\nThis IBM Redbooks® publication describes the new table type that is introduced with DB2 Analytics Accelerator V4.1 PTF5 that enables more efficient data transformations. These tables are called accelerator-only tables, and can exist on an accelerator only.\n\nThe tables benefit from the accelerator performance characteristics, while maintaining access through existing DB2 for z/OS application programming interfaces (APIs). Additionally, we describe the newly introduced analytical capabilities with DB2 Analytics Accelerator V5.1, putting you in the position to efficiently perform data modeling for online analytical requirements in your DB2 for z/OS environment.\n\nThis book is intended for technical decision-makers who want to get a broad understanding about the analytical capabilities and accelerator-only tables of DB2 Analytics Accelerator. In addition, you learn about how these capabilities can be used to accelerate in-database transformations and in-database analytics in various environments and scenarios, including the following scenarios:\n\nMulti-step processing and reporting in IBM DB2 Query Management Facility™, IBM Campaign, or Microstrategy environments\n\nIn-database transformations using IBM InfoSphere® DataStage®\n\nAd hoc data analysis for data scientists\n\nIn-database analytics using IBM SPSS® Modeler","tags":["Data","Data Engineering","Relational Databases","IBM DB2"]},{"id":"9781449380380","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"MacRuby: The Definitive Guide","authors":["Matt Aimonetti"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"October 2011","description":"Want to build native Mac OS X applications with a sleek, developer-friendly alternative to Objective-C?

Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is a technology that can provide more accurate information in near real time and thus increase the quality and timeliness of decisions based on that information. RFID systems are currently in use in areas such as inventory management, process control, asset tracking and monitoring, and retail point of sale. Organizations which appropriately incorporate RFID into their operations and information management systems have increased their agility, effectiveness, and efficiency resulting in organizational growth and increased profitability. The appropriate utilization of RFID allows organizations to become more agile resulting in their ability to respond to customers more efficiently and effectively. Technology by itself does not result in improvements and RFID is no exception. RFID is not a solution for every problem. However, when coupled with other appropriate technologies to address an appropriate objective, RFID can offer a variety of benefits to businesses. The proper integration into the firm's competitive plans and processes, and the ability to leverage those technologies for competitive advantage results in increased performance for organizations. The intent of this book is to provide a sufficient discussion of RFID to enable readers with no prior knowledge to develop a basic understanding of the technology. The book discusses current applications and specific examples of RFID usage taken from a variety of industries. The appropriate coupling of RFID with other technologies such as GPS, ERP, and robotics is discussed as well as an overview of the RFID implementation process. This book will help readers develop an understanding of the capability of the technology to increase an organization's customer responsiveness.","tags":["Hardware","Wireless Technology","Radio-frequency identification (RFID)"]},{"id":"9780749471873","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"How to Master the BMAT, 3rd Edition","authors":["Dr. Christopher See","Chris John Tyreman"],"pages":"304","publication_date":"April 2015","description":"Prepare for your BMAT with this quick and easy guide featuring over 420 practice questions, including mock tests, revision topics and video podcasts.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Career Development","Reasoning Tests"]},{"id":"9781604913286","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Leadership in Action: In Focus - Leading Through Transitions - A Kinder, Gentler, and Better Way to Downsize","authors":["Nick Yacabucci"],"pages":"3","publication_date":"October 2005","description":"Organizations can avoid the destructiveness of downsizing while accomplishing the objectives that prompted the reduction and even doing some good in the process.","tags":["Business","Human Resources","Reviews & Metrics","Goals"]},{"id":"9781604914290","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Leadership in Action: Dispersed Teams Need to Get Off on the Right Foot","authors":["Valerie I.

Simplify your codebase with hands-on examples pulled from real-life applications. Master the mysteries of asynchronous state management, detangle puzzling race conditions, and send spaceships soaring through the cosmos. When you finish this book, you'll be able to tame the wild codebeasts before they ever get a chance to wreck your day.\n\nThe front-end world can be fraught with complexity. The RxJS library offers a solution: Observables. Observables merge other JavaScript asynch mechanisms such as callbacks and promises into a new way of looking at data.

RxJS provides you the tools to manage, manipulate, and process Observables to simplify and speed up your front-end applications.\n\nNever fear, you're in exactly the right place. Don't worry about getting stuck in a mire of theory. Start off with the basics, building small applications that illustrate deeper points. Take those building blocks and apply them to much more complex problems like handling asynchronous state and dodging race conditions before they happen.

It includes the design of innovative Robot Process Automation (RPA) concepts, the discussion of related research fields (e.g., Artificial Intelligence, AI), the evaluation of existing software products, and findings from real-life implementation projects.\n\nSimilar to the substitution of physical work in manufacturing (blue collar automation), Robotic Process Automation tries to substitute intellectual work in office and administration processes with software robots (white-collar automation). The starting point for the development of RPA was the observation that – despite the use of process-oriented enterprise systems (such as ERP, CRM and BPM systems) – additional manual activities are still indispensable today. In the RPA approach, these manual activities are learned and automated by software robots, either by defining rules or by observing manual activities.\n\nRPA is related to business process management, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. Tools for RPA originated from dedicated stand-alone software. Today, RPA functionalities are also integrated into elaborated process management suites. From a conceptual perspective, RPA can be structured into input components (sensors in the wide sense), an intelligence center, and output components (actuators in the wide sense). From a strategic perspective, the impact of RPA can be related to the support of existing tasks, the complete substitution of human activities, and the innovation of processes as well as business models.\n\nAt present, high expectations are related to the use of RPA in the improvement of software-supported business processes. Manual activities are learned and automated by software robots that interact with existing applications via the presentation layer. In combination with artificial intelligence (AI) as well as innovative interfaces (e. g., voice recognition) RPA creates a novel level of automation for office and administration processes. Its benefit potential reaches a return on investment (ROI) up-to 800% that is documented in various case studies.","tags":["Hardware","Internet of Things (IoT)","Robotics","Robotic Process Automation"]},{"id":"9781803239088","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"UiPath Administration and Support Guide","authors":["Arun Kumar Asokan"],"pages":"286","publication_date":"September 2022","description":"Expand your expertise in UiPath administration and support by delving into this comprehensive guide.

As a result, a significant share of highly intermittent but clean renewable sources is being integrated into the power system using advanced technological components. The higher penetration level of renewable energy sources (RESs) has increased the active power generation share in the grid but reduced the total rotating system inertia. This high reduction in inertia brings new challenges and technical issues to the operators of modern power systems and impacts the stability and security of the grid.\n\nThe stochasticity of these renewable sources also poses a big challenge to the efficient operation of the power system. Electrical energy storage systems help to manage such issues and challenges that occur due to the intermittent nature of RES and can play a big role in the smooth and reliable operation of the power system. The applications and opportunities to use storage on the grid are growing due to the improvements in energy storage technologies, and flexible regulatory frameworks. Technological developments have made it possible to use batteries and other Energy Storage Systems (ESSs) for managing the operation of the power system.\n\nThis book aims to illustrate the potential of energy storage systems in different applications of the modern power system considering recent advances and research trends in storage technologies. These areas are going to play a very significant role in future smart grid operations.

Barrie Billingsley"],"pages":"721","publication_date":"April 2002","description":"A necessary reference for all radar engineers or analysts including many levels of managers, advisors and decision makers in the U.S. and worldwide radar industry. Directly useful in both military (DOD) and civilian (FAA) applications. The result of 20 years of research at MIT Lincoln Lab, this book is of the most significant tehcnological consequence for the industry. It actually solves the problem of low angle radar land clutter by showing the reader how to design and predict the performance of radars that operate in situations where land clutter prevalent. Radar land clutter constitutes the unwanted radar echoes returned from the earth's surface that compete against and interfere with the desired echoes returned by targets such as aircraft and other moving and stationary targets. The ability to accurately predict the effects of land clutter in surface radar has been an unsolved problem for many years. This book is comprehensive in addressing the topic, containing many interrelated results, each important in its own right. It unifies and integrates all the results so as to create a comprehensive, innovative, and unequaled work. The results of this book directly enable the reader to predict land clutter effects in surface radar. Modern military aircraft deliberately fly low to hide their presence from radars that are also dealing with land clutter. Depending on the terrain, the performance of the radar varies greatly from very good to very poor. This book helps radar engineers provide accurate assessments of ground clutter, thus bringing their ability to detect and operate against low flying aircraft to a much higher and much more consistent level.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Engineering","Radar"]},{"id":"9780123750419","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Managing Time in Relational Databases","authors":["Tom Johnston","Randall Weis"],"pages":"512","publication_date":"August 2010","description":"Managing Time in Relational Databases: How to Design, Update and Query Temporal Data introduces basic concepts that will enable businesses to develop their own framework for managing temporal data.

Yet, most organizations that use appraisal-and a similar percentage of givers and receivers of appraisal-are dissatisfied with the process. Many are beginning to deeply question whether appraisal is necessary and consistent with the work culture espoused by progressive organizations. Abolishing Performance Appraisals provides an insightful, well documented look at the flaws of appraisal-including its destructive, unintended effects-and offers practical guidance to organizations that want to move on to more progressive approaches to coaching, feedback, development, and compensation.\n\nWhile many books prescribe cures for appraisal, this is the first to focus exclusively on eliminating appraisal altogether and creating alternative, non-appraisal approaches based upon progressive and healthier assumptions about people. The authors expose and dispel the widely accepted myths and false assumptions that underlie common management strategies surrounding the five key functions of appraisal-coaching, feedback, development, compensation, and legal documentation. They then offer step-by-step practical guidance on implementing alternative non-appraisal strategies that deliver the objectives of each function. And they suggest ways to give supervisors and managers the freedom to choose for themselves the most effective ways of working with people.\n\nFilled with real-life examples, resources, tools, and detailed practical advice, Abolishing Performance Appraisals is an entirely fresh and radically different view of performance appraisal and its functions that will help people start over and discover new and more effective approaches.","tags":["Business","Human Resources","Reviews & Metrics","Performance Reviews"]},{"id":"9781484287804","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"R 4 Data Science Quick Reference: A Pocket Guide to APIs, Libraries, and Packages","authors":["Thomas Mailund"],"pages":"231","publication_date":"October 2022","description":"In this handy, quick reference book you'll be introduced to several R data science packages, with examples of how to use each of them.

Jeffery recounts the NAR’s absurdly rosy projections about real estate markets in the years running up to the mortgage meltdown, showing how the organization has managed to fly “under the radar” while other market players have been pilloried by the media and policy makers. He concludes by revealing the crucial behind-the-scenes role NAR is playing right now in the debate over remaking U.S. housing policy, its self-serving attempts to rewrite federal mortgage policy to suit its own ends, and its advocacy of a near-complete abdication of the mortgage market to the federal government.","tags":["Other","Real Estate"]},{"id":"0642572035464","language":"en","level":"Intermediate","title":"Concurrent Features in React","authors":["Tejas Kumar"],"publication_date":"May 2024","description":"This video shortcuts collection is the book Fluent React delivered as a collection of videos.

It is no longer unheard of to have 20-terabyte databases running on a SQL Server. SQL Server administration used to just be the job of a database administrator (DBA), but as SQL Server proliferates throughout smaller companies, many developers have begun to act as administrators as well. Additionally, some of the new features in SQL Server are more developer-centric, and poor configuration of these features can result in poor performance. SQL Server now enables you to manage the policies on hundreds of SQL Servers in your environment as if you were managing a single instance. We've provided a comprehensive, tutorial-based book to get you over the learning curve of how to configure and administer SQL Server 2008.\n\nWhether you're an administrator or developer using SQL Server, you can't avoid wearing a DBA hat at some point. Developers often have SQL Server on their own workstations and must provide guidance to the administrator about how they'd like the production configured. Oftentimes, they're responsible for creating the database tables and indexes. Administrators or DBAs support the production servers and often inherit the database from the developer.\n\nThis book is intended for developers, DBAs, and casual users who hope to administer or may already be administering a SQL Server 2008 system and its business intelligence features, such as Integration Services. This book is a professional book, meaning the authors assume that you know the basics about how to query a SQL Server and have some rudimentary concepts of SQL Server already. For example, this book does not show you how to create a database or walk you through the installation of SQL Server using the wizard. Instead, the author of the installation chapter may provide insight into how to use some of the more advanced concepts of the installation. Although this book does not cover how to query a SQL Server database, it does cover how to tune the queries you've already written.\n\nThe first ten chapters of the book are about administering the various areas of SQL Server, including the developer and business intelligence features. Chapter 1 briefly covers the architecture of SQL Server and the changing role of the DBA. Chapters 2 and 3 dive into best practices on installing and upgrading to SQL Server 2008. Managing your SQL Server database instance is talked about in Chapter 4. This chapter also describes some of the hidden tools you may not even know you have.\n\nOnce you know how to manage your SQL Server, you can learn in Chapter 5 how to automate many of the redundant monitoring and maintenance tasks. This chapter also discusses best practices on configuring SQL Server Agent. Chapters 6 and 7 cover how to properly administer and automate many tasks inside of the Microsoft business intelligence products, such as Integration Services and Analysis Services. Developers will find that Chapter 8 is very useful, as it covers how to administer the development features, such as SQL CLR. Chapter 9 explains how to secure your SQL Server from many common threats and how to create logins and users. Chapter 10 covers how to create a SQL Server project and do proper change management in promoting your scripts through the various environments. It also covers the Policy-Based Management framework in SQL Server.\n\nChapters 11 through 15 make up the performance tuning part of the book. Chapter 11 discusses how to choose the right hardware configuration for your SQL Server in order to achieve optimal performance. After the hardware and operating system is configured, Chapter 12 shows you how to optimize your SQL Server instance for the best performance. Chapter 13 describes how to monitor your SQL Server instance for problematic issues such as blocking and locking. Chapters 14 and 15 discuss how to optimize the T-SQL that accesses your tables and then how to index your tables appropriately.\n\nChapters 16 through 20 consist of the high-availability chapters of the book. Chapter 16 covers how to use the various forms of replication, while database mirroring is covered in Chapter 17. Classic issues and best practices with backing up and recovering your database are discussed in Chapter 18. Chapter 19 dives deeply into the role of log shipping in your high-availability strategy, and Chapter 20 presents a step-by-step guide to clustering your SQL Server and Windows 2008 server.\n\nThis edition of the book covers all the same great information we covered in the last book, and we've added loads of new content for SQL Server 2008, which adds numerous new features to improve the DBA's life. In short, the new version of SQL Server focuses on improving your efficiency, the scale of your server, and the performance of your environment, so you can do more in much less time, and with fewer resources and people. This means you can manage many servers at one time using Policy-Based Management, scale your I/O load using compression, and collect valuable information about your environment using data collectors, to name just a few key new features.\n\nTo follow the examples in this book, you will need to have SQL Server 2008 installed. If you wish to learn how to administer the business intelligence features, you need to have Analysis Services and the Integration Services components installed. You need a machine that can support the minimum hardware requirements to run SQL Server 2008; and you also need the AdventureWorks2008 and AdventureWorksDW2008 databases installed. Instructions for accessing these databases can be found in the ReadMe file on this book's Web site.\n\nSome features in this book (especially in the high-availability part) require the Enterprise or Developer Edition of SQL Server. If you do not have this edition, you will still be able to follow through some of the examples in the chapter with Standard Edition.","tags":["Data","Data Engineering","Relational Databases","Microsoft SQL Server"]},{"id":"9780470496602","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"SQL Server® 2008 Administration: Instant Reference","authors":["Michael Lee","Mike Mansfield"],"pages":"528","publication_date":"September 2009","description":"Perfect companion to any SQL Server 2008 book, providing fast, accurate answers on the spot for millions of IT professionals\n\nSystem and database administrators, IT consultants, and database application developers often need quick answers and practical solutions for SQL Server issues.

Methods to achieve greenhouse gas reduction as well as energy security vary from aiming for 100% renewable energies and setting up appropriate policy frameworks to implementing a mix of renewables comprising so-called clean fossil and nuclear energy. This book provides an analysis of the different approaches and the reasons why there is no sustainable alternative to aiming for 100% renewables – and how this vision could come true. The book provides an overview and in-depth analysis of a vital debate. It describes how the present policy framework with 2020-targets for the share of renewables, for increase of energy efficiency and for greenhouse gas emissions reduction was developed and how it has been implemented so far.

However, for the “non-agile” development organization, transitioning to agility is an enormous leap, requiring radically new skills and presenting profound risks.\n\nIn this book, leading agile practitioner Carol A. Wellington introduces the first systematic, three-phase process for moving smoothly to agility. Just as developers have learned to refactor code to improve performance and maintainability, Wellington shows how to refactor processes to improve agility.\n\nUsing Wellington’s framework, you can gradually move toward agility, while maintaining full control and avoiding disruption. You’ll lay a solid foundation for agility, and then refactor more and more of your processes, systematically introducing agility wherever it delivers compelling value. You can retain current processes that work, and implement the best agile methods for your organization, regardless of their source. This practical approach can help you build organizational confidence in agility, drive measurable benefits, and minimize risk every step of the way.\n\nCoverage includes\n\n·        Phase 1: Time-boxed iterations that deliver customer-visible functionality–not just components\n\n·        Phase 2: A lightweight measurement process to detect problems and evaluate changes withoutwasting too much time gathering and analyzing data\n\n·        Phase 3: Identifying your worst process “smells,” uncovering their true underlying causes, and fixing them\n\n·        Incrementally bringing agility to planning, estimation, analysis, design, development, and process management\n\n·        Eliminating tasks and processes that don’t add value\n\n·        Overcoming pitfalls and hidden interconnections that complicate your agile transition\n\n·        Learning to lead the transition to agility, gaining buy-in from team members, customers, and executives\n\nWhatever your role, organization, or current methodology, Refactoring to Agility can help you reap powerful value from agile methods–without the risks.\n\nDr. Carol A.

Today is no different: in fact, responsible financial innovation is now the best tool available for \"rebooting\" crippled housing markets, improving their efficiency, and making housing more accessible to millions. In Fixing the Housing Market, three leading experts explain how, covering everything decision-makers should know about today’s housing and financial markets.\n\nThe authors first explain how innovative housing financial products, services and institutions evolved through the 19th century, World War I, the Great Depression, World War II, and beyond -- culminating in the post-1970s era of securitization. Next, they assess housing finance systems in mature economies during and after the recent crisis, highlighting benefits and risks associated with each widely-used mortgage funding structure and product. They also carefully assess current housing finance structures in emerging economies such as Brazil, Russia, India, and China.\n\nBuilding on these insights, the authors introduce transformative financial innovations that can facilitate a more stable and sustainable financing system for housing -- providing better shelter for more people, helping the industry recover, and creating thousands of new jobs. Using these new tools, entrepreneurs, economic development specialists, and policymakers can develop practical strategies for bridging funding gaps -- raising more capital for longer terms at lower cost.","tags":["Other","Real Estate"]},{"id":"0738490822","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"DB2 Integrated Cluster Environment Deployment Guide","authors":["Whei-Jen Chen","Rav Ahuja","Yong Jun Bi"],"pages":"412","publication_date":"October 2004","description":"The IBM DB2 Integrated Cluster Environment for Linux is a completely integrated, high-performance, and pre-tested solution that incorporates best-of-breed software, hardware, and services.

The increasing number of normalized standards paves the way for an increase in the range of services available for each consumer. Moreover, the majority of available radio frequencies have already been allocated. This explains the emergence of cognitive radio (CR) - the sharing of the spectrum between a primary user and a secondary user.\n\nIn this book, we will present the state of the art of the different techniques for spectrum access using cooperation and competition to solve the problem of spectrum allocation and ensure better management of radio resources in a radio cognitive context.\n\nThe different aspects of research explored up until now on the applications of multi-agent systems (MAS) in the field of cognitive radio are analyzed in this book. The first chapter begins with an insight into wireless networks and mobiles, with special focus on the IEEE 802.22 norm, which is a norm dedicated to CR. Chapter 2 goes into detail about CR, which is a technical field at the boundary between telecommunications and Artificial Intelligence (AI). In Chapter 3, the concept of the \"agent\" from AI is expanded to MAS and associated applications. Finally, Chapter 4 establishes an overview of the use of AI techniques, in particular MAS, for its allocation of radio resources and dynamic access to the spectrum in CR.","tags":["Hardware","Wireless Technology","Telecommunications","Radio","Cognitive Radio"]},{"id":"9781484239483","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Advanced Raspberry Pi: Raspbian Linux and GPIO Integration","authors":["Warren Gay"],"pages":"529","publication_date":"October 2018","description":"Jump right into the pro-level guts of the Raspberry Pi with complete schematics and detailed hardware explanations as your guide.

Most patterns were extracted from Stefan Kaes' work on improving performance of the Rails core and his regular Rails performance consulting work. These patterns are largely non-algorithmic, detailing local code transformations to achieve identical results with slightly different and faster code, as even local code changes can sometimes result in orders of magnitude improvements.

Classical programming as taught in many universities leads to an atomic, row-oriented, and procedural style inspired by the structured models of programming. In short, many application developers write in the relational database exactly like in the user interface. The other style of programming is holistic, data set oriented, and coded mainly in SQL. This is the style of the database developer.\n\nThe set based and holistic style of development is not promoted enough in universities, and many application developers are not fully aware of it. There are many performance issues all over the world in relational databases due to the use of the atomic and inappropriate style of programming.

This book takes insight from many long-time home workers—remote staff, regular work-from-home employees, and freelancers—to help you equip your space, set boundaries, and use new tools and techniques.\n\nTake Control of Working from Home Temporarily is a free 61-page book tailored for the sudden onset of telecommuting. It's our way of trying to help.\n\nWe advise you on how to stake out a space to work, how to equip it either with material you already have or what to buy if you can afford to invest in the space. Do you want to stand or sit? (Get a better chair or a laptop or monitor riser.) Should you get an external monitor if you don't have one? (Yes!)\n\nThe book delves into furniture and hardware setup, including the right kind of audio input and output for calls and videoconferencing, as well as looking at security, collaboration, and communication software tools you may be unfamiliar with or might set up for your team or company.\n\nPart of the difficulty in working from home is creating a separation—physically if possible and psychologically—from the rest of your home life. This can take as much effort if you live alone as if you have a partner, roommates, or an extended family. We delve into strategies for staking boundaries, working around others, and trying to communicate limitations to your work that arise from this necessary period of isolation.\n\nFor parents, we know that you may have school-age kids at home for weeks or months, and there's a chapter with suggestions on how to juggle those obligations with your work requirements.\n\nAnd we remind you to be kind to yourself, take breaks, and not replace an absent commute with simply more work. A little tea or coffee, some stretching, and a brisk walk around the block while maintaining social distancing can go miles towards boosting your mood. This isn't easy for anyone—it's OK to admit that.\n\nWe're all navigating this new world together, and we want to help.

It details topics such as component parts and realization principles, so that different pieces may be implemented in hardware or software. Real-world examples for designers and researchers are provided, including circuit and systems examples that few books on this topic give.\n\nIn novel technical and practical detail, this book also considers:\n\nthe limitations and remedies of traditional neural associators in creating true machine cognition;\n\nbasic circuit assemblies cognitive neural architectures;\n\nhow motors can be interfaced with the associative neural system in order for fluent motion to be achieved without numeric computations;\n\nmemorization, imagination, planning and reasoning in the machine;\n\nthe concept of machine emotions for motivation and value systems;\n\nan approach towards the use and understanding of natural language in robots.\n\nThe methods presented in this book have important implications for computer vision, signal processing, speech recognition and other information technology fields. Systematic and thoroughly logical, it will appeal to practising engineers involved in the development and design of robots and cognitive machines, also researchers in Artificial Intelligence. Postgraduate students in computational neuroscience and robotics, and neuromorphic engineers will find it an exciting source of information.","tags":["Hardware","Internet of Things (IoT)","Robotics"]},{"id":"9780814420201","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"I Got My Dream Job and So Can You: 7 Steps to Creating Your Ideal Career After College","authors":["Pete Leibman"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"March 2012","description":"Recent graduates looking to enter the workforce face a discouraging job market and stiff competition for even the most entry-level positions.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Career Development","Job Seeking","Resumes & Cover Letters"]},{"id":"0672326256","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Microsoft® SQL Server High Availability","authors":["Paul Bertucci"],"pages":"456","publication_date":"November 2004","description":"Offers example-based coverage for various high availability solutions.\n\nHigh availability is becoming an increasingly important topic for database administrators, data architects and system architects.\n\nCovers choosing, planning, implementing and administering a high availability solution along with the business justifications.\n\nPaul Bertucci has over 20 years of database experience including consulting for numerous Fortune 500 companies.","tags":["Data","Data Engineering","Relational Databases","Microsoft SQL Server"]},{"id":"9780081003022","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Advances in Solar Heating and Cooling","authors":["Ruzhu Wang","Tianshu Ge"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"May 2016","description":"Advances in Solar Heating and Cooling presents new information on the growing concerns about climate change, the security of energy supplies, and the ongoing interest in replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy sources.\n\nThe amount of energy used for heating and cooling is very significant, estimated, for example, as half of final energy consumption in Europe.

The IBM System z®, the latest generation of the IBM distinguished family of mainframe systems, has come a long way from its IBM System/360 heritage. Likewise, its IBM z/OS® operating system is far superior to its predecessors in providing, among many other capabilities, world class and state-of-the-art support for the TCP/IP Internet protocol suite.\n\nTCP/IP is a large and evolving collection of communication protocols managed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), an open, volunteer organization. Because of its openness, the TCP/IP protocol suite has become the foundation for the set of technologies that form the basis of the Internet. The convergence of IBM mainframe capabilities with Internet technology, connectivity, and standards (particularly TCP/IP) is dramatically changing the face of information technology and driving requirements for even more secure, scalable, and highly available mainframe TCP/IP implementations.\n\nThe z/OS Communications Server TCP/IP Implementation series provides understandable, step-by-step guidance about how to enable the most commonly used and important functions of z/OS Communications Server TCP/IP.\n\nIn this IBM Redbooks® publication, we provide an introduction to z/OS Communications Server TCP/IP. We then discuss the system resolver, showing the implementation of global and local settings for single and multi-stack environments. We present implementation scenarios for TCP/IP Base functions, Connectivity, Routing, Virtual MAC support, and sysplex subplexing.","tags":["Data","Data Engineering","Relational Databases","IBM DB2"]},{"id":"0321422759","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Apple Pro Training Series: Getting Started with Aperture","authors":["Estelle McGechie"],"pages":"240","publication_date":"November 2005","description":"Welcome to Aperture, the revolutionary application for managing and editing digital photographs.
