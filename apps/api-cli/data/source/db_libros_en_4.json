Due to the fast-paced nature of this world, however, no one was able to take the time to properly codify its lifeblood--namely, valuation and dealmaking. Rosenbaum and Pearl originally responded to this need in 2009 by writing the first edition of the book that they wish had existed when they were trying to break into Wall Street. Investment Banking: Valuation, LBOs, M&A, and IPOs, 3rd Edition is a highly accessible and authoritative book written by investment bankers that explains how to perform the valuation work and financial analysis at the core of Wall Street – comparable companies, precedent transactions, DCF, LBO, M&A analysis...and now IPO analytics and valuation. Using a step-by-step, how-to approach for each methodology, the authors build a chronological knowledge base and define key terms, financial concepts, and processes throughout the book. The genesis for the original book stemmed from the authors' personal experiences as students interviewing for investment banking positions. As they both independently went through the rigorous process, they realized that their classroom experiences were a step removed from how valuation and financial analysis were performed in real-world situations. Consequently, they created this book to provide a leg up to those individuals seeking or beginning careers on Wall Street – from students at undergraduate universities and graduate schools to \"career changers\" looking to break into finance. Now, over 10 years after the release of the first edition, the book is more relevant and topical than ever. It is used in over 200 universities globally and has become a go-to resource for investment banks, private equity, investment firms, and corporations undertaking M&A transactions, LBOs, IPOs, restructurings, and investment decisions. While the fundamentals haven't changed, the environment must adapt to changing market developments and conditions. As a result, Rosenbaum and Pearl have updated their widely adopted book accordingly, turning the latest edition of Investment Banking: Valuation, LBOs, M&A, and IPOs into a unique and comprehensive training package, which includes:\n\nTwo new chapters covering IPOs plus insightful contributions from Nasdaq, the leading U.S. exchange and technology provider for IPOs and new listings, and global law firm Latham & Watkins LLP\nAccess to six downloadable valuation model templates, including Comparable Companies Analysis, Precedent Transactions Analysis, Discounted Cash Flow Analysis, Leveraged Buyout Analysis, and M&A models\nSix-month access to online Wiley Investment Banking Valuation Course featuring bite-sized lessons, over five hours of video lectures, 100+ practice questions, and other investment banking study tools\n\nLaunch your career on Wall Street and hone your financial expertise with Rosenbaum and Pearl’s real-world knowledge and forward-looking guidance in the latest edition of Investment Banking: Valuation, LBOs, M&A, and IPOs.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Banking"]},{"id":"9781801810906","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Data Wrangling on AWS","authors":["Navnit Shukla","Sankar M","Sam Palani"],"pages":"420","publication_date":"July 2023","description":"Data Wrangling on AWS serves as your comprehensive guide to mastering the art of data cleaning, transformation, and organization within the AWS ecosystem.

Ten years later, and against all odds, this upstart autonomous decentralized software offers an unstoppable and globally-accessible hard money alternative to modern central banks. The Bitcoin Standard analyzes the historical context to the rise of Bitcoin, the economic properties that have allowed it to grow quickly, and its likely economic, political, and social implications.\n\nWhile Bitcoin is a new invention of the digital age, the problem it purports to solve is as old as human society itself: transferring value across time and space. Ammous takes the reader on an engaging journey through the history of technologies performing the functions of money, from primitive systems of trading limestones and seashells, to metals, coins, the gold standard, and modern government debt. Exploring what gave these technologies their monetary role, and how most lost it, provides the reader with a good idea of what makes for sound money, and sets the stage for an economic discussion of its consequences for individual and societal future-orientation, capital accumulation, trade, peace, culture, and art. Compellingly, Ammous shows that it is no coincidence that the loftiest achievements of humanity have come in societies enjoying the benefits of sound monetary regimes, nor is it coincidental that monetary collapse has usually accompanied civilizational collapse.\n\nWith this background in place, the book moves on to explain the operation of Bitcoin in a functional and intuitive way. Bitcoin is a decentralized, distributed piece of software that converts electricity and processing power into indisputably accurate records, thus allowing its users to utilize the Internet to perform the traditional functions of money without having to rely on, or trust, any authorities or infrastructure in the physical world. Bitcoin is thus best understood as the first successfully implemented form of digital cash and digital hard money. With an automated and perfectly predictable monetary policy, and the ability to perform final settlement of large sums across the world in a matter of minutes, Bitcoin’s real competitive edge might just be as a store of value and network for final settlement of large payments—a digital form of gold with a built-in settlement infrastructure.\n\nAmmous’ firm grasp of the technological possibilities as well as the historical realities of monetary evolution provides for a fascinating exploration of the ramifications of voluntary free market money. As it challenges the most sacred of government monopolies, Bitcoin shifts the pendulum of sovereignty away from governments in favor of individuals, offering us the tantalizing possibility of a world where money is fully extricated from politics and unrestrained by borders.\n\nThe final chapter of the book explores some of the most common questions surrounding Bitcoin: Is Bitcoin mining a waste of energy? Is Bitcoin for criminals? Who controls Bitcoin, and can they change it if they please? How can Bitcoin be killed? And what to make of all the thousands of Bitcoin knock-offs, and the many supposed applications of Bitcoin’s ‘blockchain technology’? The Bitcoin Standard is the essential resource for a clear understanding of the rise of the Internet’s decentralized, apolitical, free-market alternative to national central banks.","tags":["Software Development","Blockchain / Decentralized Apps","Blockchain","Cryptocurrency","Bitcoin"]},{"id":"9781492031482","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Programming Bitcoin","authors":["Jimmy Song"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"February 2019","description":"Dive into Bitcoin technology with this hands-on guide from one of the leading teachers on Bitcoin and Bitcoin programming.

Due to the fast-paced nature of this world, however, no one has been able to take the time to properly codify the lifeblood of the corporate financier's work—namely, valuation. Rosenbaum and Pearl have responded to this need by writing the book that they wish had existed when they were trying to break into Wall Street.\n\nInvestment Banking: Valuation, Leveraged Buyouts, and Mergers & Acquisitions is a highly accessible and authoritative book that focuses on the primary valuation methodologies currently used on Wall Street—comparable companies, precedent transactions, DCF, and LBO analysis. These methodologies are used to determine valuation for public and private companies within the context of M&A transactions, LBOs, IPOs, restructurings, and investment decisions. Using a step-by-step how-to approach for each methodology, the authors build a chronological knowledge base and define key terms, financial concepts, and processes throughout the book. They also provide a comprehensive overview of the fundamentals of LBOs and an organized M&A sale process.\n\nIn the aftermath of the subprime mortgage crisis and ensuing credit crunch, the world of finance is returning to the fundamentals of valuation and critical due diligence. This involves the use of more realistic assumptions governing approach to risk as well as a wide range of value drivers. While valuation has always involved a great deal of \"art\" in addition to time-tested \"science,\" the artistry is perpetually evolving in accordance with market developments and conditions. In this sense, this book is particularly topical—in addition to detailing the technical fundamentals behind valuation, the authors infuse practical judgment skills and perspective to help guide the science.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Banking"]},{"id":"9780137941476","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate (SAA-C02) Guided Cert Prep","authors":["Chad Smith","Mark Wilkins"],"pages":"18","publication_date":"May 2022","description":"AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate (SAA-C02) Guided Cert Prep\n\nA complete path of videos, books, practice tests, and live training to help you gain exam readiness\n\nBy: Chad Smith and Mark Wilkins\n\nLevel up your IT career with the knowledge required to become an Associate level AWS Certified Solutions Architect.

This book discusses the convergence of two transformative technologies, digital twin and blockchain, to address urban challenges and propel the development of smarter, more sustainable cities. This convergence empowers cities to create real-time replicas of urban environments (digital twins) and secure, transparent data management (blockchain) to improve city planning, management, and civic services. In this application, the concept of a digital twin involves creating a virtual, data-driven replica of a city or specific urban systems, such as transportation, energy, or infrastructure. This digital twin mirrors the real world, gathering data from various sensors, IoT devices, and other sources to provide a holistic view of the city’s operations.\n\nFurthermore, blockchain technology offers a decentralized and tamper-resistant ledger for securely storing and managing data. In the context of smart cities, blockchain can ensure data integrity, privacy, and transparency, enabling trust and collaboration among various stakeholders. This book covers many important topics, including real-time city modeling; data security and the trustworthy storage of sensitive urban data; transparent governance to facilitate accountable governance and decision-making processes in smart cities; improved city services; disaster resilience (by providing insights into vulnerabilities and efficient resource allocation during crises); sustainable urban planning that optimizes resource allocation, reduces energy consumption, and minimizes environmental impact, which fosters sustainable development; citizen engagement; and much more.\n\nThis book will not only provide information about more efficient, resilient, and sustainable urban environments, but it also empowers citizens to be active participants in shaping the future of their cities. By converging these technologies, cities can overcome existing challenges, encourage innovation, and create more livable, connected, and responsive urban spaces.\n\nAudience This book has a wide audience in computer science, artificial intelligence, and information technology as well as engineers in a variety of industrial manufacturing industries. It will also appeal to economists and government/city policymakers working on smart cities, the circular economy, clean tech investors, urban decision-makers, and environmental professionals.","tags":["Software Development","Blockchain / Decentralized Apps","Blockchain"]},{"id":"9781805123903","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Mastering AWS CloudFormation - Second Edition","authors":["Karen Tovmasyan"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"November 2023","description":"Mastering AWS CloudFormation provides technical insights on how to leverage AWS CloudFormation for Infrastructure as Code, enabling you to simplify complex infrastructure and implement best practices in the AWS cloud.\n\nWhat this Book will help me do\n\nUnderstand and implement Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using AWS CloudFormation.\nDevelop reusable and modular templates for scalable cloud infrastructure.\nMaster CI/CD practices for automated deployments using AWS tools.\nImplement custom resources to extend CloudFormation capabilities.\nUse AWS CDK and SAM to generate advanced templates and manage serverless deployments.\n\nAuthor(s)\n\nKaren Tovmasyan is a seasoned cloud architect and AWS expert with years of experience designing and managing cloud-based infrastructures.

What will banking look like in 30 years? 50 years? The world’s best banks have been forced to adapt to changing consumer behaviors; regulators are rethinking friction, licensing and regulation; Fintech start-ups and tech giants are redefining how banking fits in the daily life of consumers. To survive, banks are having to develop new capabilities, new jobs and new skills. The future of banking is not just about new thinking around value stores, payment and credit utility — it’s embedded in voice-based smart assistants like Alexa and Siri and soon smart glasses which will guide you on daily spending and money decisions. The coming Bank 4.0 era is one where either your bank is embedded in your world via tech, or it no longer exists.\n\nIn this final volume in Brett King’s BANK series, we explore the future of banks amidst the evolution of technology and discover a revolution already at work.

ZAG follows the ultra-clear \"whiteboard overview\" style of the author’s first book, THE BRAND GAP, but drills deeper into the question of how brands can harness the power of differentiation. The author argues that in an extremely cluttered marketplace, traditional differentiation is no longer enough—today companies need “radical differentiation” to create lasting value for their shareholders and customers. In an entertaining 3-hour read you’ll learn: - why me-too brands are doomed to fail - how to \"read\" customer feedback on new products and messages - the 17 steps for designing “difference” into your brand - how to turn your brand’s “onliness” into a “trueline” to drive synergy - the secrets of naming products, services, and companies - the four deadly dangers faced by brand portfolios - how to “stretch” your brand without breaking it - how to succeed at all three stages of the competition cycle From the back cover: In an age of me-too products and instant communications, keeping up with the competition is no longer a winning strategy. Today you have to out-position, out-maneuver, and out-design the competition. The new rule? When everybody zigs, zag. In his first book, THE BRAND GAP, Neumeier showed companies how to bridge the distance between business strategy and design. In ZAG, he illustrates the number-one strategy of high-performance brands—radical differentiation.

Activity-based enterprise non-interest cost management is an important component of enterprise risk adjusted return management methodology. This book builds on the author Kannan Subramanian’s earlier book, Event- and Data-Centric Enterprise Risk-Adjusted Return Management, delving in depth into enterprise non-interest operating cost management and operating leverage.\n\nOperating Leverage is about managing a bank’s capabilities and its capacity to deliver its products and services efficiently. It is not limited to managing operational costs but includes the operational support for the growth of business and for improving profitability. Profit is an absolute measure that denotes the amount of money the bank makes after deducting all expenses. Profitability measures how efficient the bank is at utilizing its resources to generate risk-adjusted returns. The reader can learn to improve risk adjusted operational effectiveness by implementing a nuanced approach to managing performance, risk, control, and cost simultaneously, at the process level.\n\nYou’ll examine how some institutions have implemented activity-based costing in a siloed environment and without enterprise process automation.  Many institutions do not have a scientific way of managing non-interest costs.

Shapiro proposes an important new paradigm for understanding biological evolution, the core organizing principle of biology. Shapiro introduces crucial new molecular evidence that tests the conventional scientific view of evolution based on the neo-Darwinian synthesis, shows why this view is inadequate to today's evidence, and presents a compelling alternative view of the evolutionary process that reflects the shift in life sciences towards a more information- and systems-based approach in Evolution: A View from the 21st Century.\n\nShapiro integrates advances in symbiogenesis, epigenetics, and saltationism into a unified approach that views evolutionary change as an active cell process, regulated epigenetically and capable of making rapid large changes by horizontal DNA transfer, inter-specific hybridization, whole genome doubling, symbiogenesis, or massive genome restructuring.\n\nEvolution marshals extensive evidence in support of a fundamental reinterpretation of evolutionary processes, including more than 1,100 references to the scientific literature. Shapiro's work will generate extensive discussion throughout the biological community, and may significantly change your own thinking about how life has evolved. It also has major implications for evolutionary computation, information science, and the growing synthesis of the physical and biological sciences.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Science","Biology"]},{"id":"9780132623117","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Logic of Chance: The Nature and Origin of Biological Evolution","authors":["Eugene V.

The author presents many specific examples from systems and comparative genomic analysis to begin to build a new, much more detailed, complex, and realistic picture of evolution. The book examines a broad range of topics in evolutionary biology including  the inadequacy of natural selection and adaptation as the only or even the main mode of evolution; the key role of horizontal gene transfer in evolution and the consequent overhaul of the Tree of Life concept;  the central, underappreciated evolutionary importance of viruses; the origin of eukaryotes as a result of endosymbiosis; the concomitant origin of cells and viruses on the primordial earth; universal dependences between genomic and molecular-phenomic variables; and the evolving landscape of constraints that shape the evolution of genomes and molecular phenomes.\n\n\"Koonin's account of viral and pre-eukaryotic evolution is undoubtedly up-to-date.

Shapiro proposes an important new paradigm for understanding biological evolution, the core organizing principle of biology. Shapiro introduces crucial new molecular evidence that tests the conventional scientific view of evolution based on the neo-Darwinian synthesis, shows why this view is inadequate to today's evidence, and presents a compelling alternative view of the evolutionary process that reflects the shift in life sciences towards a more information- and systems-based approach in Evolution: A View from the 21st Century.\n\nShapiro integrates advances in symbiogenesis, epigenetics, and saltationism into a unified approach that views evolutionary change as an active cell process, regulated epigenetically and capable of making rapid large changes by horizontal DNA transfer, inter-specific hybridization, whole genome doubling, symbiogenesis, or massive genome restructuring.\n\nEvolution marshals extensive evidence in support of a fundamental reinterpretation of evolutionary processes, including more than 1,100 references to the scientific literature. Shapiro's work will generate extensive discussion throughout the biological community, and may significantly change your own thinking about how life has evolved. It also has major implications for evolutionary computation, information science, and the growing synthesis of the physical and biological sciences.","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Science","Biology"]},{"id":"9780470376034","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"BSD Unix® Toolbox: 1000+ Commands for FreeBSD®, OpenBSD, and NetBSD®","authors":["Francois Caen","Christopher Negus"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"May 2008","description":"This handy, compact guide teaches you to use BSD UNIX systems as the experts do: from the command line.

Version 1.1, updated January 17, 2022\n\nIn Take Control of Cryptocurrency, Glenn Fleishman casts aside the headlines and hype around cryptocurrency to dig in on the fundamentals. You learn everything you need to know as an individual from the ground up about cryptocurrency, including details about the popular forms of it. You’ll find out what risks it poses for the planet—and for your pocketbook. Discover the role of a cryptocurrency wallet, how to find the best one, and how to use it safely. You will understand the ins and outs of buying and selling cryptocurrency and using it for real-world purchases and sales. Glenn also explains the mystery of NFTs (non-fungible tokens), which are a peculiar but popular use of cryptocurrency that lets you own unique digital artwork.\n\nCryptocurrency is a new way of representing value that’s going through the throes of change and no one knows exactly what form of it will survive and thrive. It hit the mainstream years ago but 2021 seemed to whip people into a frenzy over Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, and several other popular forms. Valuations—the price in cash one could get when selling cryptocurrency—soared. But cryptocurrency doesn’t have an inherent price: it’s worth only what people will pay for it. In May 2021, most cryptocurrencies plunged in value by half or more.\n\nMeanwhile, a similar furor arose over the introduction of “non-fungible tokens” (NFTs), a way to use an aspect of cryptocurrency to buy and sell unique ownership of digital assets, like born-digital art and clips from NBA basketball games. NFTs similarly suffered a giant drop in value from a peak in May 2021. What is this all about, anyway? Why did cryptocurrency and NFTs tank?\n\nTake Control of Cryptocurrency ignores the hype in favor of the reality beneath it. This new form of currency is not going away, even if the price in dollars, euros, and renminbi may fluctuate madly. The future of the economy will incorporate cryptocurrency and you can get to know it in great but understandable detail with the help of author Glenn Fleishman.\n\nThis book teaches you what cryptocurrency really is and how it relates to government-backed money. Glenn walks through all the parts of a cryptocurrency in clear detail—like a wallet, blockchain, and transactions—and explains how cryptocurrencies produce permanent transfers. He also lets you see two different kinds of risk: the side effects of Bitcoin and others in consuming massive amounts of electricity and the rise of ransomware on the back of somewhat anonymized payments, and the risk to your pocketbook from scams and thefts (and how to guard against them).\n\nOf course, you also learn how to manage cryptocurrency: find out what a wallet does and how to obtain one (and which might be a good fit); buying, selling, and exchanging cryptocurrency; and even purchasing or selling items in the physical world using cryptocurrency. Glenn also delves into how NFTs swept the news in early 2021, as creators and others staked a claim on defining an “original” item in a digital world, and how—and whether—to get involved in buying and selling NFTs.\n\nWarning: Purchasing, holding, and selling cryptocurrency comes with a large variety of risks. This book doesn’t recommend investing in it or offer legal or financial advice. Instead, it’s an objective, friendly introduction to understanding and engaging in it, teaching a reader the risks so they can manage them.\n\nThis covers everything to do with cryptocurrency that you need to know to become an informed participant:\n\nMaster the elements that let you get set up and successfully buy, sell, and hold cryptocurrency.\nLearn what the blockchain is and how it works to commit transactions irrevocably.\nGet to know all the parts of a cryptocurrency, like coins, transactions, and wallets.\nDig into mining to understand the role that specialized participants in a cryptocurrency play in keeping the system running.\nDiscover the details and basics of major cryptocurrencies, including how to understand transaction fees and pay just the right amount when you post a transaction.\nAvoid fraud by learning how hackers and malware might target you.\nFigure out the right cryptocurrency wallet for you and how to protect its secrets.\nDevelop a working knowledge of proof of work and proof of stake, popular methods by which cryptocurrency ensure transactions are accurate and permanently committed.\nLearn why Bitcoin is using a significant percentage of the world’s electricity, and how that might change.\nThe emergence of cryptocurrency is a challenge to governments, particularly tax agencies. Get a grasp on what you need to know to record your interactions and avoid running afoul of financial rules and penalties.\nPuzzle out what a non-fungible token (NFT) really is and whether it means anything—to you or anyone else.","tags":["Software Development","Blockchain / Decentralized Apps","Blockchain","Cryptocurrency"]},{"id":"9781260468687","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Promise of Bitcoin: The Future of Money and How It Can Work for You","authors":["Bobby C.

The way individuals, organizations, and governments conduct transactions—from purchasing a book online to acquiring major corporations to delivering billions in financial aid—will look vastly different in the near future. Bitcoin is spearheading this revolution and may be the best investment opportunity of our time, yet most people have yet to understand its promise. In this book, Bobby C. Lee, one of the earliest, most successful pioneers in the cryptocurrency space, debunks myths and dispels fears that surround Bitcoin, arguing that this rational, logical system is superior to traditional monetary systems. He cites signs of Bitcoin’s widening acceptance: a growing community of users worldwide and multiple initiatives for investing in and holding bitcoin among major financial services organizations and institutional investors who control trillions in assets. Lee offers a primer on the best strategies for investing in this digital currency, the value of which will only continue to grow. He discusses the pros and cons, and covers the complicated yet more profitable method of acquiring bitcoin, mining. He offers predictions for the future, including price, trajectory, use, and participation in the larger economy—as well as developments in regulation, technology, business, and society. Invest in the promise of Bitcoin today.","tags":["Software Development","Blockchain / Decentralized Apps","Blockchain","Cryptocurrency","Bitcoin"]},{"id":"9781592534272","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Really Good Logos Explained","authors":["Margo Chase","Rian Hughes","Ron Miriello"],"pages":"288","publication_date":"May 2008","description":"A collection of 500 great logos critiqued by a panel of internationally acclaimed designers In Really Good Logos Explained, some of today’s top creative minds critique and appraise over 500 examples of truly exceptional logos, and explain what makes them work.","tags":["Design","Branding"]},{"id":"9780132143233","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Effective Branding Begins with a Name...And Other Keys to Creating Brands People Love","authors":["Brian D.

In the secret world of private equity, few buyouts have been written about with such clarity, detail, and insight—and none with such completeness, covering not only the dealmaking but also the transformation and eventual exit of the investment.\n\nFor anyone who has ever wondered how private equity investors strike bargains, turn around businesses, and create immense value—or anyone interested in a captivating story of high-stakes money-making—this book is a must-read.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Banking"]},{"id":"9783111574851","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Digital Blockchain","authors":["Rishabha Malviya","Shristy Verma","Sonali Sundram"],"pages":"267","publication_date":"April 2025","description":"\"Digital Blockchain- Big Data, Artificial Intelligence and Virtual Reality in Healthcare Ecosystem\" is a book that explores the revolutionary impact of blockchain, big data, and artificial intelligence (AI) on the pharmaceutical and healthcare sectors.

Unlike traditional currencies, Bitcoin is not issued from or managed by any central government bank or organization. With Bitcoin, users become their own banks – and assume all the risks inherent in that proposal. As such, the value of a bitcoin is not pegged to any traditional real-world currency. Over the currency's relatively short life, the dollar value of a bitcoin has fluctuated from 14 cents (actually, zero at inception) to more than $1,2000. (Today a bitcoin is worth approximately 800 US dollars.)\n\nBitcoin exists on a peer-to-peer network, much like BitTorrent. Users on the P2P network, called miners, enable their PCs to be used to host and manage bitcoin transactions. To use Bitcoin, a user must sign up with an online wallet service, through which all transactions are managed. This digital wallet is typically stored on the P2P servers, with all transactions secured via public-key encryption. The public key is used to encode all payments, which can then be retrieved only with the use of the user's private key.\n\nOne can earn bitcoins by providing goods or services to other users or by participating in the mining process. Users can also purchase bitcoins with traditional currency from one of several Bitcoin Exchanges. Bitcoins can then be spent on other goods and services available over the Internet.","tags":["Software Development","Blockchain / Decentralized Apps","Blockchain","Cryptocurrency","Bitcoin"]},{"id":"9780137043866","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Chips, Clones, and Living Beyond 100: How Far Will the Biosciences Take Us?","authors":["Paul J.

The result is a blurring of the boundaries and assigning creative powers to both. A customer has a number of interactions with the company, and each of these interactions has an impact on the brand equity account – either positive or negative. Examples of interactions include: the product itself, the purchasing process, the consumption experience, the 'face' of the organization, the call center, media etc. The real issue for the company is how to translate the optimized 'ideal' customer journey into effective company programmes, how to track their progress and their actual impact on brand equity, customer satisfaction and loyalty.\n\nThis book takes a holistic view to brand management and distills this complex system into palatable chunks, involving all functions of the company. The book demonstrates the effect of an organization that facilitates and rewards employee brand commitment on 'external brand equity (eg: customer satisfaction and loyalty) and 'internal brand equity' (eg: product improvement and innovation potential resident in the organization).\n\nWhile the more obvious benefits of this approach include the usual suspects such as increased sales and revenues, less obvious benefits include employee stress reduction through the elimination of tensions and incongruity between external and internal value systems. The result is a significant contribution to creativity, brand commitment, overall employee satisfaction and, finally, a company's ability to attract and retain talent.\n\nThe above is achieved via a very practical, step-by-step guide, lavishly illustrated with case studies from over 100 fascinating brands (the authors have researched and surveyed companies such as: Aer Lingus, BMW, BP, Deutsche Bank, Ducati, Edun, Google, innocent drinks, Lacoste, Lego, Manner, Maggi, Orange, Old Mutual, Rabobank, Sony, SOS Childrens Villages, Siemens, Thomas Sabo, TED/United, TUI, UBS, Vauxhall, Wal-Mart, Wikimedia, any many more) the authors are able to paint a very real picture of the issues facing business and provide powerful solutions.

Bayesian Estimation and Tracking addresses the gap in the field on both accounts, providing readers with a comprehensive overview of methods for estimating both linear and nonlinear dynamic systems driven by Gaussian and non-Gaussian noices.\n\nFeaturing a unified approach to Bayesian estimation and tracking, the book emphasizes the derivation of all tracking algorithms within a Bayesian framework and describes effective numerical methods for evaluating density-weighted integrals, including linear and nonlinear Kalman filters for Gaussian-weighted integrals and particle filters for non-Gaussian cases. The author first emphasizes detailed derivations from first principles of eeach estimation method and goes on to use illustrative and detailed step-by-step instructions for each method that makes coding of the tracking filter simple and easy to understand.\n\nCase studies are employed to showcase applications of the discussed topics. In addition, the book supplies block diagrams for each algorithm, allowing readers to develop their own MATLAB toolbox of estimation methods.\n\nBayesian Estimation and Tracking is an excellent book for courses on estimation and tracking methods at the graduate level.

This is sometimes called Web 3.0. While Web 1.0 transformed information sharing and commerce and brought us giants like Google and Amazon and Web 2.0 unlocked the social potential of the internet and created Facebook, Twitter, and Snapchat, exactly what will come of Web 3.0 remains to be seen.\n\nIt is indisputable that the seed of Web 3.0 is the technological, social, and economic  innovations that came together in Bitcoin and the blockchain technology it created. But where the first web iterations were relatively straightforward to understand, the inner workings of Web 3.0 remain more opaque and shrouded in mystique.\n\nCurrent voices on Bitcoin and the blockchain revolution fall squarely into one of two camps; either technological “experts” who are all also invariably personally invested in the success of Bitcoin and the blockchain or “critics” who are typically deeply invested in the status quo and the failure of Bitcoin and blockchain. It seems like there is a need for a middle ground to provide the public with a more unbiased view of this important technology.\n\nThis book therefore aims to unveil some of the mystique and show how to unlock the potential of the blockchain revolution in a manner that does not dismiss out of hand even radical and outlandish ideas nor jumps on the bandwagon of hailing Bitcoin and the blockchain as the answer to all problems.\n\nWhat you’ll learn\n\nThe nature of blockchain technology, how it works and what it does.\nThe history of the technological developments that lead to the blockchain.\nA historical analysis of who the likely creator of Bitcoin is.\nHow bitcoin and cryptocurrencies fit in the history of human exchange.\nThe nature and history of electronic money.\nHow blockchain technology solves problems in a novel way and what it cannot be used for.\nWhat web 3.0 could be.\n\nWho This Book Is For\n\nThis book is for a general non-technical audience trying to understand the difficult and complex nature of blockchain and cryptocurrencies and the contours of the Web 3.0 revolution.","tags":["Software Development","Blockchain / Decentralized Apps","Blockchain"]},{"id":"9781430219767","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Foundation Blender Compositing","authors":["Roger D.

Any transaction engaged in by the central bank—issuing currency, conducting foreign exchange operations, investing its own funds, intervening to provide emergency liquidity assistance and carrying out monetary policy operations—influences its balance sheet. Despite this, many central banks throughout the world have largely ignored balance sheet movements, and have instead focused on implementing interest rates.\n\nIn this book, Mustapha Abiodun Akinkunmi highlights the challenges and controversies faced by central banks in the past and present when implementing policies, and analyzes the links between these policies, the central bank balance sheet, and the consequences to economies as a whole. He argues that the composition and evolution of the central bank balance sheet provides a valuable basis for understanding the needs of an economy, and is an important tool in developing strategies that would most effectively achieve policy goals.

This in turn creates a self-fulfilling cycle, wherein trust begets social capital, which begets more trust—and even shared thinking—not to mention better sales.\n\nBrand Valued will receive the full support of Havas, the fifth largest global communication and marketing services group in the world.\n\nIn easy to understand terms, and using concrete examples, Brand Valued provides:\n\nThe tools necessary to stimulate dialogue—and new ways of thinking—between a brand and its intended audience\n\nMethods for extending brand messaging to wider audiences\n\nIdeas on how to make brands the engines of social capital, getting rid of unsustainable practices to foster more sustainable patterns of consumer behaviour\n\nSuggestions for the development of a new brand strategy that reduces costs through innovative and lasting solutions to problems\n\nUnpublished data on the role of consumer trust in new products based on research carried out by the Havas Group across over 150 brands in nine different markets\n\nA wiki component to the book in an accompanying website.\n\nDesigned to forge stronger channels of dialogue and communication with customers and consumers, the book is a must-read for anyone committed to keeping their brand relevant in the twenty-first century.","tags":["Design","Branding"]},{"id":"9780749472627","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"What is a 21st Century Brand?","authors":["Nick Kendall"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"April 2015","description":"Think more broadly about brands and better serve your clients with a selection of essays from some of the best and brightest in the industry.","tags":["Design","Branding"]},{"id":"9781119823476","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Securing Delay-Tolerant Networks with BPSec","authors":["Edward J.

This book explains how finance and economics work today, and how the convergence of various technologies related to the financial sector can help us find solutions to problems, such as excessive debt creation, banks getting too big to fail, and shadow banking. The Blockchain Alternative offers sensible corrections to outdated and incorrect dogmas, such as the efficient markets hypothesis and rational expectations theory. You'll also be introduced to universal basic income, the consequences of going cashless, why complexity economics needs to be understood and what kinds of tools and theories you'll need to redefine the existing definition of capitalism.\n\nWhile the book does discuss technologies and methods that are primed for our future, a number of references are made to economic history and the works of great thinkers from a different era. You'll see how the blockchain can be used to deploy solutions that were devised in the past, but which can serve as the antidote to our current economic malaises. You'll discover that what is required today is not an adaptation of the old theories, but a new methodology that is suited to this new era. Without undertaking such an endeavor, one will always be burdened with a definition of capitalism that is out of kilter with the evolution of our digital humanity.\n\nWhat would this mean to monetary and fiscal policy, market structure and our current understanding of economics? More importantly would we need to change our current understanding of capitalism? And if we were to change our perceptions, what would the future version look like? This book answers these questions, and analyses some of the most pertinent issues of our generation.\n\nWhat You'll Learn\n\nExamine fractional banking, debt, and the financialization of assets\n\nGain a firm understanding of the \"too big to fail\" theory, smart contracts, and Fintech\n\nReview economics and agent-based modelling\n\nUse the blockchain and complexity economics to rethink economics and capitalistic systems\n\nWho This Book Is For\n\nThe primary audience is bankers and other finance professionals, policy makers, and students of finance and economics.

Where is the European financial crisis headed? What will it mean for global and US markets? In this short book, internationally respected Financial Times journalist John Authers illuminates today's European financial crisis and the massive forces increasingly buffeting world and US economies. Authers explains why a strong recovery remains far away, why the risk of a disastrous \"final\" crisis remains terrifyingly real, and how investors can best navigate today's brutally challenging markets. The European Financial Crisis reveals why the 2010/2011 market rallies were so fearful, and why their underlying assumptions -- continued Chinese growth, bailouts, progress towards bank solvency, more easy \"Fed\" money -- have proven so tenuous. Above all, Authers shows how the Eurozone crisis uncovers today's worst unaddressed risk: the markets' loss of confidence in governments. This brief discussion offers  insights into underlying flaws in the banking system and the Eurozone's structure that remain unaddressed; how cheap money and bailouts have bought time that is rapidly running out; and the increasingly frightening signs of \"perverse synchronization\": forex, equity, credit, and commodity markets massively moving in tandem. He also offers specific recommendations for what policymakers can and must do now to restore the long-term health of the global markets.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Banking"]},{"id":"9781420010367","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Introduction to Biological Networks","authors":["Alpan Raval","Animesh Ray"],"pages":"335","publication_date":"April 2016","description":"With many examples throughout and clear explanations of key concepts, this book focuses on the genetic interaction networks as a paradigm for interpreting the complexity of molecular biology at a genomic scale.

It discusses the strengths as well as weaknesses of TFS, and suggests appropriate problem resolution steps, workarounds, or custom solutions.\n\nAbout the Technology\n\nIn complex software projects, managing the development process can be as critical to success as writing the code itself. A project may involve dozens of developers, managers, architects, testers, and customers, hundreds of builds, and thousands of opportunities to get off-track. To keep tabs on the people, tasks, and components of a medium- to large-scale project, most teams use a development system that allows for easy monitoring, follow-up, and accountability.\n\nMicrosoft Team Foundation Server 2008 (TFS), the server component of Microsoft's Visual Studio Team System (VSTS), provides a powerful collaborative platform for software-development teams. The product offers an integrated toolset for tracking work items, creating test cases, managing source code, generating builds, constructing database schemas, and so on.

B. Holt"],"pages":"288","publication_date":"November 2004","description":"Coca-Cola. Harley-Davidson. Nike. Budweiser. Valued by customers more for what they symbolize than for what they do, products like these are more than brands--they are cultural icons. How do managers create brands that resonate so powerfully with consumers? Based on extensive historical analyses of some of America's most successful iconic brands, including ESPN, Mountain Dew, Volkswagen, Budweiser, and Harley-Davidson, this book presents the first systematic model to explain how brands become icons. Douglas B. Holt shows how iconic brands create \"identity myths\" that, through powerful symbolism, soothe collective anxieties resulting from acute social change. Holt warns that icons can't be built through conventional branding strategies, which focus on benefits, brand personalities, and emotional relationships. Instead, he calls for a deeper cultural perspective on traditional marketing themes like targeting, positioning, brand equity, and brand loyalty--and outlines a distinctive set of \"cultural branding\" principles that will radically alter how companies approach everything from marketing strategy to market research to hiring and training managers. Until now, Holt shows, even the most successful iconic brands have emerged more by intuition and serendipity than by design. With How Brands Become Icons, managers can leverage the principles behind some of the most successful brands of the last half-century to build their own iconic brands. Douglas B. Holt is associate professor of Marketing at Harvard Business School.","tags":["Design","Branding"]},{"id":"9780470574928","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"3D for iPhone® Apps with Blender and SIO2: Your Guide to Creating 3D Games and More with Open-Source Software","authors":["Tony Mullen"],"pages":"328","publication_date":"February 2010","description":"Create exciting, interactive 3D apps for the iPhone and iPod Touch\n\nWhat a combination-using free, open-source Blender software and the SI02 game engine to create very cool 3D characters and games for the very hot devices of the moment, the iPhone and iPod Touch.

It's impossible to anticipate each reader's hardware configuration and goals for working with FreeBSD, so instead of telling you how to set up your machine to perform specific tasks, this guide will show you how to install and configure various services and programs. This Short Cut is organized into two sections: desktop and server. From those two starting points, you can customize FreeBSD to meet nearly any need. If you're new to FreeBSD, start at the beginning and skip ahead when you hit a section that isn't relevant to what you need to do.","tags":["Software Development","Operating Systems","BSD","FreeBSD"]},{"id":"9781492069263","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Build Your First Ethereum DApp","authors":["Bruno Skvorc"],"pages":"153","publication_date":"August 2018","description":"In this book we'll walk through the creation of a complete distributed application (DApp) based on the Ethereum platform.

It originated as a spontaneous social institution, and its use is still inextricably tied to market exchange. Therefore, the analysis of money occurs in a market setting. Use of monetary systems and a market setting as the underlying parameters ideally positions the reader to examine money in its various uses: as a medium of exchange, in credit markets, and as an instrument of monetary policy. Professor Gerdes believes that the study of money should commence at the most general level. Consequently, this book is anchored in the context of monetary systems (commodity, fiduciary, and fiat monies). This gives readers a very broad perspective-helping readers understand, for example, how the money used today differs from money used in the past, or how current money relates to money discovered by anthropologists in isolated subcultures.

It shows you how to harness this powerful combination to your own advantage by helping you understand how customers’ brains work when they choose brands. A strong brand cannot be build effectively without taking into account the laws of the brain – which, as this book shows, really exist and can be scientifically proven to work. Once you know this, you can apply the familiar branding laws of relevance, coherence and participation more precisely, more confidently and to much greater effect.

At its core, a blockchain injects trust into the network, cutting off some intermediaries from serving that function and creatively disrupting how they operate. Metaphorically, blockchains are the ultimate non-stop computers. Once launched, they never go down, and offer an incredible amount of resiliency, making them dependable and attractive for running a new generation of decentralized services and software applications. \n\nThe Business Blockchain charts new territory in advancing our understanding of the blockchain by unpacking its elements like no other before. William Mougayar anticipates a future that consists of thousands, if not millions of blockchains that will enable not only frictionless value exchange, but also a new flow of value, redefining roles, relationships, power and governance. In this book, Mougayar makes two other strategic assertions. First, the blockchain has polymorphic characteristics; its application will result in a multiplicity of effects. Second, we shouldn’t ask ourselves what problems the blockchain solves, because that gives us a narrow view on its potential. Rather, we should imagine new opportunities, and tackle even more ambitious problems that cross organizational, regulatory and mental boundaries. \n\nDrawing on 34 years of technology industry experience as an executive, analyst, consultant, entrepreneur, startup mentor, author, blogger, educator, thought leader and investor, William Mougayar describes a future that is influenced by fundamental shifts brought by blockchain technology as the catalyst for change. William Mougayar has been described as the most sophisticated blockchain business thinker. He is a blockchain industry insider whose work has already shaped and influenced the understanding of blockchain for people around the world, via his generous blogging and rigorous research insights. He is a direct participant in the crypto-technology market, working alongside startups, entrepreneurs, pioneers, leaders, innovators, creators, enterprise executives and practitioners; in addition to being an investor, advisor, and board member in some of the leading organizations in this space, such as the Ethereum Foundation, OpenBazaar and Coin Center.\n\nJust as the Internet created new possibilities that we didn’t foresee in its early years, the blockchain will give rise to new business models and ideas that may still be invisible. Following an engaging Foreword by Vitalik Buterin, this book is organized along these 7 chapters:\n\n1. What is the Blockchain?\n\n2. How Blockchain Trust Infiltrates\n\n3. Obstacles, Challenges & Mental Blocks\n\n4. Blockchain in Financial Services\n\n5. Lighthouse Industries & New Intermediaries\n\n6. Implementing Blockchain Technology\n\n7. Decentralization as the Way Forward\n\nThe Business Blockchain is an invitation for technologists to better understand the business potential of the blockchain, and for business minded people to grasp the many facets of blockchain technology.

The authors illuminate every specification that's ready for practical use, covering messaging, metadata, security, discovery, quality of service, business-process modeling, and more.

More than half of us will die from complex diseases that trace directly to those vulnerabilities, and the modern world we’ve created places us at unprecedented risk from them. In It Takes a Genome, Greg Gibson posits a revolutionary new hypothesis: Our genome is out of equilibrium, both with itself and its environment. Simply put, our genes aren’t coping well with modern culture. Our bodies were never designed to subsist on fat and sugary foods; our immune systems weren’t designed for today’s clean, bland environments; our minds weren’t designed to process hard-edged, artificial electronic inputs from dawn ‘til midnight. And that’s why so many of us suffer from chronic diseases that barely touched our ancestors.\n\nGibson begins by revealing the stunningly complex ways in which multiple genes cooperate and interact to shape our bodies and influence our behaviors. Then, drawing on the very latest science, he explains the genetic “mismatches” that increasingly lead to cancer, diabetes, inflammatory and infectious diseases, AIDS, depression, and senility. He concludes with a look at the probable genetic variations in human psychology, sharing the evidence that traits like introversion and agreeableness are grounded in equally complex genetic interactions.\n\nIt Takes A Genome demolishes yesterday’s stale debates over “nature vs. nurture,” introducing a new view that is far more intriguing, and far closer to the truth.  \n\n    See how broken genes cause cancer Meet the body’s “genetic repairmen”—and understand what happens when they fail\n\nThe growing price of the modern lifestyle Why one-third of all Westerners have obesity, Type 2 diabetes, or other signs of “metabolic syndrome”\n\nThe Alzheimer’s generation Why some of us are predisposed to dementia\n\nWhat’s really normal: the deepest lessons of the human genome The remarkable diversity of physical and emotional “normality”","tags":["Math, Science, Engineering","Science","Biology","Genomics"]},{"id":"9781788994521","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Hands-On Blockchain with Hyperledger","authors":["Nitin Gaur","Luc Desrosiers","Venkatraman Ramakrishna"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"June 2018","description":"Explore the robust world of blockchain technology with 'Hands-On Blockchain with Hyperledger'.

Consequently, the book is anchored in the context of monetary systems (commodity, fiduciary, and fiat monies).The intent is to give the student of money a very broad perspective. It allows the reader to understand, for example, how the money we use today differs from money used in the past, or how our current money relates to money discovered by anthropologists in isolated subcultures. Money is a market phenomenon. It originated as a spontaneous social institution, and its use is still inextricably tied to market exchange. Therefore, the analysis of money occurs in a market setting. Use of monetary systems and a market setting as the underlying parameters ideally positions the reader to examine money in its various uses: as foreign exchange, in credit markets, and as an instrument of monetary policy. The material in the book is suited for upper-division college students and business professionals with an interest in reaching an understanding of money.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Banking"]},{"id":"9781789807974","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Blockchain Quick Start Guide","authors":["Xun (Brian) Wu","Weimin Sun"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"December 2018","description":"Embark on your journey into blockchain development with \"Blockchain Quick Start Guide\"!

Rather than simply selling on price, retailers have transformed private labels into brands.

The growth in private labels has huge implications for managers on both sides. Yet, brand manufacturers still cling to their outdated assumptions about private labels. In Private Label Strategy: How to Meet the Store Brand Challenge, Nirmalya Kumar and Jan-Benedict E.M.

Do your customers use any of these words to describe what you sellor how you sell it? If so, welcome to the club. Inundated by fakes and sophisticated counterfeits, people increasingly see the world in terms of real or fake. They would rather buy something real from someone genuine rather than something fake from some phony. When deciding to buy, consumers judge an offering's (and a company's) authenticity as much asif not more thanprice, quality, and availability. In Authenticity, James H. Gilmore and B. Joseph Pine II argue that to trounce rivals companies must grasp, manage, and excel at rendering authenticity. Through examples from a wide array of industries as well as government, nonprofit, education, and religious sectors, the authors show how to manage customers' perception of authenticity by: recognizing how businesses \"fake it;\" appealing to the five different genres of authenticity; charting how to be \"true to self\" and what you say you are; and crafting and implementing business strategies for rendering authenticity. The first to explore what authenticity really means for businesses and how companies can approach it both thoughtfully and thoroughly, this book is a must-read for any organization seeking to fulfill consumers' intensifying demand for the real deal.","tags":["Design","Branding"]},{"id":"9780132119603","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Using Blogger","authors":["Michael Miller"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"May 2010","description":"More than just a book!\n\n                                           \n\nGet comfortable with the latest version of Blogger.  Don’t just read about it: see it, hear it, with step-by-step video tutorials and valuable audio sidebars.

One of the biggest steps forward is the standardization of Java APIs for Bluetooth wireless technology (JABWT). The latest updates to this standard is explained in detail in this book. The JABWT standard, defined by the JSR-82 Java Specification Request, supports rapid development of Bluetooth applications that are portable, secure, and highly-usable. Wireless device manufacturers have responded overwhelmingly to the JABWT specification by implementing JABWT applications in mobile phones and other personal wireless communications products. Bluetooth Application Programming Essentials: Programming with the Java APIs explains in detail how to write Bluetooth applications using the Java APIs to exploit the power of both technologies. Written by the specification lead for JSR-82 and two other key participants in developing the standards of JABWT, this book provides the authoritative explanations and concrete examples needed to get started right away.This book provides embedded Java developers with to-the-point information on the APIs in the specification with detailed programmatic examples of the APIs in use. A NEW chapter on the Push Registry definition (a new feature in the 1.1 version of JSR-82) has been added.

Branding is all about creating a message or an impression that makes an impact and creates a rational and emotional connection with a customer. Forming a bond of trust and comfort will build brand equity (i.e., how people value your brand) and customer loyalty. We are living in a dynamic, transformative global economy with mind-boggling advances in technology. Managers today can easily become preoccupied with social media vehicles and the innovative features of electronic devices, and hence neglect the importance of the content or the message. Adhering to the core elements of positioning and branding will help them develop more emotionally rich and powerful content.

He looked into this new virtual money more than once and, each time, decided not to invest. Like many long-term investors, he was looking for fundamentals. Crypto had none — or so he thought. This book details why his perspective on cryptoassets has shifted – and why yours should, too.\n\nRecent developments in this field have turned crypto from a speculative financial innovation to a new asset class, one with a new kind of fundamentals that offer real economic value. One that will change finance and investments. One that may be a trigger defining the fourth industrial revolution, the same way steam, electricity, and the Internet were triggers for the first, second, and third industrial revolutions, respectively.\n\nDespite what advocates of the traditional financial establishmentlike to claim, cryptoassets were by far the best financial investment of the last decade, even risk-adjusted, and could still be so for the coming one. They should not be overlooked, regardless of one’s opinion of them.\n\nThis book answers the main questions any potential long-term investor in cryptoassets should ask:\n\nWhat are cryptoassets and blockchain technology?\nWhy consider cryptoasset investments?\nWhen is a good time to invest?\nWhere should one invest?\nHow should one invest?\nWhich valuation methods are appropriate?\n\nUnderstanding Crypto Fundamentals includes a deep dive into the management of risks specific to cryptoassets, both financial and non-financial, and provides the tools needed for investment success in this new asset class. Upon completing the book, you will have a new perspective on cryptoassets and how you can benefit from them as an investor.\nThomas Jeegers is a CFA Charterholder and Financial Risk Manager (FRM), and has earned an MBA from INSEAD as well as multiple blockchain certifications from institutions including INSEAD and Oxford University.

It covers distributed systems, distributed consensus, and relevant system models. And you'll explore how classical and modern consensus algorithms work. The book also covers quantum consensus and explains the role that quantum computing plays in distributed systems.\n\nConsensus protocols allow participants in distributed systems to agree on a common value, despite faults. It's a fundamentally important construct in distributed systems. As a result of rigorous and ground-breaking research over the last four decades, many consensus mechanisms have been developed and are used in the industry today. However, with the advent of Blockchain technology, a renewed interest has arisen in this area, resulting in more research and innovation.\n\nThe first Blockchain, Bitcoin, was invented in 2008 and introduced a novel consensus protocol called Nakamoto consensus, a solution to the Byzantine General's problem formulated almost 30 years ago. Since the introduction of Bitcoin, the interest in Blockchain and consensus protocols has risen exponentially. As a result, researchers from academia and industry have proposed many new consensus mechanisms. While fundamental goals and some techniques remain the same as established classical protocols, these modern protocols introduce innovative methods to achieve consensus in Blockchain. Some classical algorithms have been modified to make them suitable for Blockchain and some new protocols have been developed.\n\nThis book is a detailed account of classical distributed consensus and Blockchain consensus algorithms. It explains why and how cryptocurrencies and Blockchain remain secure and decentralized without depending on a trusted third party. In addition, you'll learn how Blockchain can endure, even with hundreds or thousands of participants, out of which some might be malicious. The book introduces quantum consensus, which deals with the problem of reaching agreement in quantum networks and how to enhance classical results.\n\nWhat You Will Learn\n\nUnderstand distributed systems, distributed consensus, and relevant system models and protocols\nUnderstand Blockchain and Blockchain consensus algorithms\nKnow how classical and modern consensus algorithms work\nKnow the inner workings of Paxos, RAFT, PBFT, HotStuff, proof of work, proof of stake, GRANDPA, Casper, proof of history, and other consensus protocols\nUnderstand quantum Byzantine agreement and quantum consensus\n\nWho This Book Is For\n\nDistributed systems and Blockchain students and researchers, Blockchain practitioners, architects, designers, product managers, and developers\n\nThis book targets many audiences as well as those with curious minds. It explains the classical consensus mechanisms, Blockchain age consensus protocols, and the latest developments in distributed consensus. The book does not assume any advanced knowledge of Blockchain or distributed systems, but a general understanding of computing and appreciation of Blockchain technology is helpful. Early chapters provide the necessary background to read and understanding consensus-related content quickly.\n\nReaders who already understand classical consensus protocols and distributed systems but want to learn about Blockchain consensus will find the book helpful as it covers Blockchain age protocols in detail. Readers who have come to the Blockchain world without any, or with little, background in distributed systems or classical consensus protocols will find this book equally helpful as it provides a solid understanding of classical consensus protocols.\n\nIf you have no experience in Blockchain or don’t understand distributed computing in general, this book will give you a solid understanding of both subjects and enable you to conduct further research in this exciting area of distributed computing.","tags":["Software Development","Blockchain / Decentralized Apps","Blockchain"]},{"id":"9781837639915","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Azure for Decision Makers","authors":["Jack Lee","Jason Milgram","David Rendón"],"pages":"146","publication_date":"September 2023","description":"Azure for Decision Makers is your comprehensive guide to understanding and leveraging Azure for business infrastructure and cloud optimization.

Reading bank balance sheets is not everyone's idea of a good time. But Mr. Onaran, with support from Ms. Bair, does the chore and explains what it means. Mr. Onaran shows that the process of rescuing dead and dying banks is increasing systemic risk in the global banking system. And that is really more frightening than scream flicks from Tinseltown.\" -- Financial Post\n\nZombie banking has become standard operating procedure for big debtor nations. They prop up failing institutions, print money, and avoid financial corrections. But in an attempt to prolong the inevitable, bigger problems are created. The approach used now has not, and will not, work. This timely book reveals why. Zombie Banks tells the story of how debtor nations and failing institutions are damaging the long-term prospects of the global economy.\n\nAuthor Yalman Onaran, a veteran Bloomberg News reporter and financial banking sector expert, examines exactly what a zombie bank is and why they are kept alive. He also discusses how they hurt economic recovery and what needs to be done in order to restore stability. Along the way, Onaran takes an honest look at how we arrived at this point and details the harsh realities that must be faced, and the serious steps that must be taken, in order to get things headed in the right direction.\n\nPuts insolvent banks and debtor nations in the spotlight and examines how they are crippling the global economy\n\nOn the record sources include Paul Volcker, Joseph Stiglitz, Sheila Bair, and many more bank executives, regulators, politicians, and policymakers in the United States and abroad\n\nTakes the complexity of the current situation and translates it in a way that makes it understandable\n\nWhile the short-term measures taken to stave off depression and rejuvenate economic growth may offer hope, they are unsustainable over the long term.

Tap into one or more of these, and your brand will stick forever.\n\nIn Branding Between the Ears, world-renowned marketing thought leader Sandeep Dayal explains how to leverage behavioral psychology, social anthropology, and neuroscience to decode what goes on in consumer minds—and create effective marketing strategies to build the kind of loyalty that fuels today’s iconic brands. Dayal reveals that most successful cognitive brands are architected around three questions consumers ask themselves:\n\nDoes this brand give me good vibes?\nDoes what this brand says make sense to me?\nWill I be happier if I buy this brand?\nThese three factors—good brand vibes, brand sense, and brand resolve—are the hidden mantra that push customers off the fence of indecision, and get them not just to admire, but actually buy the brands again and again.Branding Between the Ears reveals paradigm shifts in building and executing brands that are informed by a burgeoning body of research in brain sciences, and offers a better way to make brands that not just stand out, but connect with consumers and embed deeply in their thoughts to drive choice.Dayal is the marketing thought leader who predicted that “consumer collaboration” would be the key factor in winning people’s trust online and giving consumers control over their personal information would be central to gaining their trust—issues that are unfolding today.Now, with Branding Between the Ears he provides equally prescient principles and new ideas for gaining the competitive edge in a largely uncertain future and winning with cognitive power brands.","tags":["Design","Branding"]},{"id":"9781848218079","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Evolutionary Computation with Biogeography-based Optimization","authors":["Haiping Ma","Dan Simon"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"February 2017","description":"Evolutionary computation algorithms are employed to minimize functions with large number of variables.

E-business applications can retrieve and catalog products according to their logos. Governmental agencies can easily inspect goods using smart mobile devices that use logo recognition techniques. However, because logos are two-dimensional shapes of varying complexity, the recognition process can be challenging. Although promising results have been found for clean logos, they have not been as robust for noisy logos.\n\nLogo Recognition: Theory and Practice is the first book to focus on logo recognition, especially under noisy conditions. Beginning with an introduction to fundamental concepts and methods in pattern and shape recognition, it surveys advances in logo recognition. The authors also propose a new logo recognition system that can be used under adverse conditions such as broken lines, added noise, and occlusion.\n\nThe proposed system introduces a novel polygonal approximation, a robust indexing scheme, and a new line segment Hausdorff distance (LHD) matching method that can handle more distortion and transformation types than previous techniques. In the first stage, raw logos are transformed into normalized line segment maps. In the second stage, effective line pattern features are used to index the database to generate a moderate number of likely models. In the third stage, an improved LHD measure screens and generates the best matches.
