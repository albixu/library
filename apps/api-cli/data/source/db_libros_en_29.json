Every chapter gives you something visually new and exciting to add to your works-in-progress, from creating reflections and shadows that make objects look more realistic, to rendering a scene from any directional point of view.\n\nYou’ll learn how to:\n\n•Represent objects in a scene, and use perspective projection to draw them in •Compute the illumination for light sources (point, directional, and ambient) •Render mirror-like reflections on surfaces, and cast shadows for depth •Use clipping algorithms to render a scene from any camera position •Implement flat shading, Gouraud shading, and Phong shading algorithms •\"\"Paint” textures that fake surface details and turn shapes into everyday objects\n\nThe book uses informal pseudocode throughout the text, so you can write your renderers in any language. In addition, the author provides links to live working versions of his algorithms.","tags":["Software Development","Graphics Programming"]},{"id":"9781098168094","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Developing Apps with GPT-4 and ChatGPT, 2nd Edition","authors":["Olivier Caelen","Marie-Alice Blete"],"pages":"272","publication_date":"July 2024","description":"This book provides an ideal guide for Python developers who want to learn how to build applications with large language models.

But these tools tend to focus organizational attention on past actions and compliance. Executives need to tackle risk head-on as an integral part of their strategic planning process, not by looking in the rearview mirror. Strategic Risk Management (SRM) is a forward-looking approach that helps teams anticipate events or exposures that fundamentally threaten or enhance a firm's position. The authors, experts in both business strategy and risk management, define strategic risks and show how they differ from operational risks. They offer a road map that describes architectural elements of SRM (knowledge, principles, structures, and tools) to show how leaders can integrate them to effectively design and implement a future-facing SRM program. SRM gives organizations a competitive advantage over those stuck in outdated risk management practices.

Yet every day we base our personal and business plans on uncertainties, whether they be next month's sales, next year's costs, or tomorrow's stock price. In The Flaw of Averages, Sam Savageknown for his creative exposition of difficult subjects describes common avoidable mistakes in assessing risk in the face of uncertainty. Along the way, he shows why plans based on average assumptions are wrong, on average, in areas as diverse as healthcare, accounting, the War on Terror, and climate change. In his chapter on Sex and the Central Limit Theorem, he bravely grasps the literary third rail of gender differences.\n\nInstead of statistical jargon, Savage presents complex concepts in plain English. In addition, a tightly integrated web site contains numerous animations and simulations to further connect the seat of the reader's intellect to the seat of their pants.\n\nThe Flaw of Averages typically results when someone plugs a single number into a spreadsheet to represent an uncertain future quantity. Savage finishes the book with a discussion of the emerging field of Probability Management, which cures this problem though a new technology that can pack thousands of numbers into a single spreadsheet cell.\n\nPraise forThe Flaw of Averages\n\n\"Statistical uncertainties are pervasive in decisions we make every day in business, government, and our personal lives.

For example, the author explains that films with a dominant red influence have themes and characters that are powerful, lusty, defiant, anxious, angry, or romantic and discusses specific films as examples. She explores each film, describing how, why, and where a color influences emotions, both in the characters on screen and in the audience.

Organizations began to see the real value of information and information technology in the mid-1980s. Forty years later, it’s time to leverage your ECRM program and cybersecurity strategy in the same way.\n\nThe main topics covered include the case for action with specific coverage on the topic of cybersecurity as a value creator, including how the courts, legislators, and regulators are raising the bar for C-suite executives and board members. The book covers how the board’s three primary responsibilities (talent management, strategy, and risk management) intersect with their ECRM responsibilities.\n\nECRM was once solely focused on managing the downside of risk by defending the organization from adversarial, accidental, structural, and environmental threat sources. Author BobChaput presents the view that we must focus equally on managing the upside of cyber strengths to increase customer trust and brand loyalty, improving social responsibility, driving revenue growth, lowering the cost of capital, attracting higher quality investments, creating competitive advantage, attracting and retaining talent, and facilitating M&A work. He focuses on the C-suite and board role in the first part and provides guidance on their roles and responsibilities, the most important decision about ECRM they must facilitate, and how to think differently about ECRM funding. You will learn how to the pivot from cost-center thinking to value-center thinking.\n\nHaving built the case for action, in the second part, the book details the steps that organizations must take to develop and document their ECRM program and cybersecurity strategy. The book first covers how ECRM must be integrated into business strategy. The remainder of that part presents a sample table of contents for an ECRM Program and Cybersecurity Strategy document and works through each section to facilitate development of your own program and strategy. With all the content and ideas presented, you will be able to establish, implement, and mature your program and strategy.\n\nWhat You Will Learn\n\nRead new information and treat ECRM and cybersecurity as a value creator\nReceive updates on legal cases, legislative actions, and regulations that are raising the stakes for organizations, their C-suites, and boards\nThink differently about funding ECRM and cybersecurity initiatives\nUnderstand the most critical ECRM decision that boards must facilitate in their organizations\nUse practical, tangible, actionable content to develop and document your ECRM program and cybersecurity strategy\n\n“This book should be mandatory reading for C-suite executives and board members. It shows you how to move from viewingcybersecurity as a risk to avoid, and a cost center that does not add value and is overhead, to seeing cybersecurity as an enabler and part of your core strategy to transform your business and earn customer and stakeholder trust.”\n\n—Paul Connelly, First CISO at the White House and HCA Healthcare\n\n \n\nWho This Book Is For\n\nThe primary audience includes Chief Information Security Officers, Chief Risk Officers, and Chief Compliance Officers.

That’s why most books on risk management focus strictly on hedging or mitigating risk.\n\nBut the enterprise’s relationship with risk should be far more nuanced. Great companies become great because they seek out and exploit intelligent risks, not because they avoid all risk. Strategic Risk Taking: A Framework for Risk Management is the first book to take this broader view, encompassing both risk hedging at one end of the spectrum and strategic risk taking on the other.\n\nWorld-renowned financial pioneer Aswath Damodaran–one of BusinessWeek’s top 12 business school professors–is singularly well positioned to take this strategic view. Here, Damodaran helps you separate good risk (opportunities) from bad risk (threats), showing how to utilize the former while protecting yourself against the latter. He introduces powerful financial tools for evaluating risk, and demonstrates how to draw on other disciplines to make these tools even more effective.\n\nSimply put, Damodaran has written the first book that helps you use risk to increase firm value, drive higher growth and returns, and create real competitive advantage.\n\n•   Risk: the history and the psychology\n\nThe non-financial realities you must understand to successfully manage risk\n\n•   Risk assessment: from the basics to the cutting edge\n\nRisk Adjusted Value, probabilistic approaches, Value at Risk, and more\n\n•   Utilizing the power of real options\n\nExtending option pricing models to reflect the potential upside of risk exposure\n\n•   Risk management: the big picture\n\nIntegrating traditional finance with corporate strategy–and using risk strategically\n\nBack Flap\n\nAbout the Author\n\nAswath Damodaran, Professor of Finance at NYU’s Stern School of Business, has been profiled in BusinessWeek as one of the United States’ top twelve business school professors. His researchinterests include valuation, portfolio management, and applied corporate finance. He is the author of Damodaran on Valuation; Investment Valuation; The Dark Side of Valuation; Corporate Finance: Theory and Practice; Applied Corporate Finance; and most recently, Investment Fables.\n\nDamodaran has published in The Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, The Journal of Finance, The Journal of Financial Economics, and The Review of Financial Studies.\n\nBack Cover\n\nBeyond Traditional Hedging: How to Use Risk Management Financial Techniques Strategically!\n\n•How to determine which risks to ignore, which to protect against, and which to actively exploit\n\n•By Aswath Damodaran, leading finance authority and one of BusinessWeek’s top 12 business school professors\n\n•For every corporate finance executive, manager, analyst, consultant, researcher, and student\n\nIn recent years, risk management has been defined as merely eliminating or reducing\n\nrisk exposure. Companies are learning today that is far too narrow and constraining a definition. Risk, exploited judiciously, is absolutely central to business success. In Strategic Risk Taking: A Framework for Risk Management, Aswath Damodaran covers both sides of the risk equation, offering a complete framework for maximizing profit by limiting some risks and exploiting others.\n\nDamodaran presents a thorough and insightful review of the state-of-the-art in risk measurement, hedging, and mitigation. He covers a broad spectrum of risk assessment tools, including risk adjusted value, scenario analysis, decision trees, VAR, and real options. But Damodaran goes far beyond other treatments of the subject, helping you decide when to deliberately increase exposure to certain risks, and clearly assess the potential dangers and payoffs of doing so.\n\nhttp://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/","tags":["Security","Governance, Risk Management and Compliance (GRC)","Operational Risk"]},{"id":"9781780676265","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Editorial Design","authors":["Cath Caldwell","Yolanda Zappaterra"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"October 2014","description":"Editorial Design: Digital and Print is a comprehensive guide to the traditional and digital skills that a designer will need for a future career in visual journalism today – the design of magazines and newspapers for a wide variety of markets.

The purpose of the standard is to create a framework to ensure that the Board is appropriately involved in the governance of the organisation's IT. The standard sets out guiding principles for directors on how to ensure the effective, efficient and acceptable use of IT within their company.\n\nThis useful pocket guide provides an account of the scope and objectives of the standard. It outlines the standard's six core principles, sets out the three major tasks that the standard assigns to directors regarding IT, and explains the interrelationship between the two. The guide also offers advice on how to set up and implement the IT governance framework.\n\nBusiness benefits of ISO/IEC 38500 (ISO38500) include:\n\nManage the organisation's investment in IT responsibly The pocket guide shows how the standard can be used to ensure that your decision making about IT investment remains clear and transparent, and that the associated risks are clearly understood.\n\nMeet compliance requirements ISO/IEC38500 requires directors to verify that their IT systems are in compliance with all applicable regulations. As this pocket guide explains, following the procedures set out in ISO/IEC38500 will help company directors both to achieve and demonstrate compliance.\n\nImprove the performance of the organisation On average, investment in IT represents more than 50 per cent of every organisation's annual capital investment. Both private and public sector organisations need to maintain a high standard of service while at the same time keeping costs low. The pocket guide looks at how following the guidance contained in ISO/IEC38500 can enable directors to retain a grip on costs and obtain better value for money from IT equipment.\n\nIntroduce effective project governance This pocket guide describes how ISO/IEC38500 can help company directors to identify problems in an IT project at an early stage. In this way, the standard promotes effective management of the risks associated with major IT projects, enables the board to keep a grip on budgets and militates against project failure.\n\nImplement ISO38500, the international standard for corporate governance of IT\n\nAn IT governance framework serves to close the gap between the importance of IT and the understanding of IT. For this reason, you can use an IT governance framework to improve your company's competitive position.","tags":["Security","Governance, Risk Management and Compliance (GRC)","Governance"]},{"id":"9781605097169","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Robert K.

Robert Greenleaf's landmark 1970 essay, The Servant as Leader, introduced the now common term “servant leadership” to the world. His work has been cited by leading writers and business people including Ken Blanchard, Stephen Covey, Peter Senge, Margaret Wheatley, and Peter Block and led to the development of Centers for Servant Leadership around the world. This long-awaited biography of Robert Greenleaf, authorized by his surviving children, finally tells his story. Drawn from Greenleaf's personal papers, correspondence, and interviews with family and friends, it provides a fascinating look at the sources of Greenleaf's thought, his friendships with some of the most influential men and women of the twentieth century—including Eleanor Roosevelt, Peter Drucker, the Menninger brothers, Reinhold Niebuhr, Aldous Huxley, Alcoholics Anonymous co-founder Bill Wilson, and many others—and how he influenced business history well before his first book was published at the age of seventy-three. At a time when leadership and management fads substitute as wisdom, Robert Greenleaf's life stories provide clues for how each person can make a difference in the workplace, no matter what position he or she holds.","tags":["Business","Operations","Green Business Practices"]},{"id":"9789332501454","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Fundamentals of Digital Image Processing","authors":["S.

To discover such processes it is necessary to investigate software applications, graphical user interfaces, programming languages and code, algorithms, data structures, and data types in their relationship with graphical outcomes and design possibilities.\n\nThis book studies interfaces as images and images as interfaces. It offers a comprehensible framework to study graphical representations of visual information. It explores the relationship between visual information and its graphical supports, taking into account contributions from fields of visual computing.

Information technology can enable you to improve your operations and cut costs. And by changing the way you deal with your customers, IT may even have the potential to transform your entire business.\n\nHowever, IT involves an element of risk. For the sake of your bottom line, these risks are something your company needs to be capable of managing.\n\nIT governance and the board\n\nIT governance generally enjoys less board understanding and commitment than corporate governance. However, the reality is that the IT function is vital to the running of your business and so IT governance too requires leadership from the top.\n\nInformation security breaches have the potential to alienate your customers and to damage your company's reputation. The consequences of cyber crime could cripple your business with heavy financial losses. Failure to comply with the information security requirements of corporate governance codes may even cause your company to be denied a presence in entire countries.\n\nThe road to information security goes through corporate governance. This means that information security has to be a specific board-agenda item, and a priority at CEO level.\n\nIT governance and intellectual property\n\nWhile you can easily judge how much a factory is worth, some of your company's most important assets may be the intangible ones. The real worth of your company is a matter of its intellectual capital - such as patents, designs and databases - as well as the sites and machinery in its possession.\n\nThis kind of information is held on computer systems. So your company needs to be as serious about protecting its digital information from industrial espionage and cybercrime as it is about protecting its warehouses from robbery and arson.\n\nIT governance as a business enabler\n\nHaving an effective IT governance framework in place will help you to safeguard your company against an information security breach. At the same time, your IT governance framework can open doors for your business.\n\nBy ensuring that your IT systems are properly integrated with your business, and in harmony with your overall business goals, your company will be in a far better position to drive through changes and improvements. Establishing an IT governance framework is essential for the success both of IT projects and for the larger projects that need support from across the whole organisation.\n\n\"","tags":["Security","Governance, Risk Management and Compliance (GRC)","Governance"]},{"id":"9780133835922","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Analytics Across the Enterprise: How IBM Realizes Business Value from Big Data and Analytics","authors":["Brenda L.

HIPAA is US legislation that was signed into law in 1996. HIPAA was enacted to protect health insurance coverage, but was later extended to ensure protection and privacy of electronic health records and transactions. In simple terms, it was instituted to modernize the exchange of healthcare information and how the Personally Identifiable Information (PII) that is maintained by the healthcare and healthcare-related industries are safeguarded.\n\nFrom a technology perspective, one of the core requirements of HIPAA is the protection of Electronic Protected Health Information (ePHIPer through physical, technical, and administrative defenses. From a non-compliance perspective, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) added protections to HIPAA and increased penalties $100 USD - $50,000 USD per violation. Today, HIPAA-compliant solutions are a norm in the healthcare industry worldwide.\n\nThis IBM® Redpaper publication describes HIPPA compliance requirements for storage and how security enhanced software-defined storage is designed to help meet those requirements.

HIPAA is US legislation that was signed into law in 1996. HIPAA was enacted to protect health insurance coverage, but was later extended to ensure protection and privacy of electronic health records and transactions. In simple terms, it was instituted to modernize the exchange of healthcare information and how the Personally Identifiable Information (PII) that is maintained by the healthcare and healthcare-related industries are safeguarded.\n\nFrom a technology perspective, one of the core requirements of HIPAA is the protection of Electronic Protected Health Information (ePHIPer through physical, technical, and administrative defenses. From a non-compliance perspective, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) added protections to HIPAA and increased penalties $100 USD - $50,000 USD per violation. Today, HIPAA-compliant solutions are a norm in the healthcare industry worldwide.\n\nThis IBM® Redpaper publication describes HIPPA compliance requirements for storage and how security enhanced software-defined storage is designed to help meet those requirements.

Realizing this fact, we all must try to understand this \"risk\" and if possible to minimize it. This book expands the conversation beyond failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) techniques. While FMEA is indeed a powerful tool to forecast failures for both design and processes, it is missing methods for considering safety issues, catastrophic events, and their consequences. Focusing on risk, safety, and HAZOP as they relate to major catastrophic events, Introduction to Risk and Failures: Tools and Methodologies addresses the process and implementation as well as understanding the fundamentals of using a risk methodology in a given organization for evaluating major safety and/or catastrophic problems.\n\nThe book identifies and evaluates five perspectives through which risk and uncertainty can be viewed and analyzed: individual and societal concerns, complexity in government regulations, patterns of employment, and polarization of approaches between large and small organizations. In addition to explaining what risk is and exploring how it should be understood, the author makes a distinction between risk and uncertainty. He elucidates more than 20 specific methodologies and/or tools to evaluate risk in a manner that is practical and proactive but not heavy on theory. He also includes samples of checklists and demonstrates the flow of analysis for any type of hazard.\n\nWritten by an expert with more than 30 years of experience, the book provides from-the-trenches examples that demonstrate the theory in action. It introduces methodologies such as ETA, FTA, and others which traditionally have been used specifically in reliability endeavors and details how they can be used in risk assessment. Highly practical, it shows you how to minimize or eliminate risks and failures for any given project or in any given work environment.","tags":["Security","Governance, Risk Management and Compliance (GRC)","Operational Risk"]},{"id":"9781000947472","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"The 90-Day ISO 9000 Manual","authors":["Peter Mauch","James Stewart","Frank Straka"],"pages":"184","publication_date":"May 2023","description":"Designed and written by professionals with extensive ISO 9000 Certification experience, the techniques and forms in this Manual have been used successfully to achieve certification at over 50 companies","tags":["Security","Governance, Risk Management and Compliance (GRC)","Quality Management Systems","ISO 9000"]},{"id":"9780133962475","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Design Fundamentals: Notes on Type","authors":["Rose Gonnella","Christopher Navetta","Max Friedman"],"pages":"216","publication_date":"October 2015","description":"Design Fundamentals: Notes on Type looks like a design student’s sketchbook with handwritten notes and full-color, hand-drawn illustrations. But it’s more than that.

While selected books and standards touch on this important topic, few are devoted to program governance as a subject. This book fills that need.Program Governance provides a thorough understanding of governance while reviewing the underlying theories. The first book dedicated to this subject, it caters to the needs of practitioners, researchers, and students of management and governance. The book provides a holistic view of program governance while covering multiple elements of program governance. Topics covered include the governance structure, governance roles, governance functions, governance mechanisms, factors influencing the governance framework, and different domains of programs that come under the jurisdiction of a governance framework.The book presents the author’s own program governance framework, called the Contingent Governance Framework for Programs (CGFPrgTM), which is adaptable to suit different program contexts. This adaptability ensures that the different elements of governance, including structure and mechanisms, are aligned with program requirements. Such alignment results in an efficient and effective environment with an increased probability of program success.The text supplies references to research and case studies to help readers understand key concepts in more detail.

These organizations often have the best security software money can buy, with equally developed policies with which to execute them, but they fail to take into account the weakest link in their implementation: human nature. Despite all other efforts, people can sway from what they should be doing.\n\nPreventing Good People from doing Bad Things drives that concept home to business executives, auditors, and IT professionals alike. Instead of going through the step-by-step process of implementation, the book points out the implications of allowing users to run with unlimited administrator rights, discusses the technology and supplementation of Microsoft's Group Policy, and dives into the different environments least privilege affects, such as Unix and Linux servers, and databases.\n\nReaders will learn ways to protect virtual environments, how to secure multi-tenancy for the cloud, information about least privilege for applications, and how compliance enters the picture. The book also discusses the cost advantages of preventing good people from doing bad things. Each of the chapters emphasizes the need auditors, business executives, and IT professionals all have for least privilege, and discuss in detail the tensions and solutions it takes to implement this principle. Each chapter includes data from technology analysts including Forrester, Gartner, IDC, and Burton, along with analyst and industry expert quotations.\n\nWhy unlimited administration rights are a bad thing\n\nWhy least privileges is a good solution\n\nEffective implementation of least privileges\n\nLeast privileges on Unix and Linux servers\n\nIssues with Microsoft's Group Policy\n\nWho this book is for\n\nThe audience is segmented into three separate categories, all of which are clearly addressed and weighed-in on in each chapter: the auditor, the businessman, and the IT professional.\n\nAuditor\n\nThe first segment are the information technology security auditors. They are the ones responsible for the analysis of technical, physical, and administrative controls in the organization(s) whose security is in question. Their work includes the auditing of data center personnel, computer equipment, all policies and procedures, physical and environmental controls, and back-up procedures. Because their jobs so heavily rely on established protocols for the protection of sensitive information, this segment of the market will find this book a must-read. Their main concern is making sure the companies they are inspecting are in compliance with regulations and are taking the appropriate measures to secure their information and the users accessing them. They will learn how least privilege is the only way to fully satisfy government security regulations, and it will give them necessary and cutting-edge information on how to correctly perform their jobs.\n\nBusinessperson\n\nThe second segment are the businesspeople. They are the ones who run the companies requiring least privilege. These individuals are driven by the bottom line, and are ultimately concerned with spending and returns on investment. While they may be interested in security and realize its importance, the motivation behind any decisions is saving the company money. They need this book because it will clearly outline the financial benefits of implementing least privilege. It will explain that, from a business point of view, least privilege is the only way to eliminate the misuse of privilege and avoid the extensive costs of security breaches, expensive audits, help desk costs, and costly hours of IT troubleshooting. They will read it and use it as a reference as they prepare financially for a more secure IT environment.\n\nIT Professional\n\nThe third and final segment are the IT professionals. They are the ones who appreciate security for security's sake. They understand the implications of a noncompliant environment. They are on the forefront of the company's information environment. They manage users and those users' privileges. They download applications, grant privileges to users, process information, store information, program, install software, perform data management, network machines, and manage the networks they create. They need and will read this book because it will expand their understanding of the concept of least privilege and apply it to the environment in which they work. They will learn how to supplement Group Policy to attain least privilege, how to protect their environments, and how to carry security throughout their enterprise. This book will teach them new ways to look at the principle of least privilege, and it will educate them with the information necessary to receive executive and financial backing to the projects that will secure their network.","tags":["Security","Governance, Risk Management and Compliance (GRC)","Compliance"]},{"id":"9781484212271","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Beginning Neo4j","authors":["Chris Kemper"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"January 2016","description":"This book is your introduction in the world of graph databases, and the benefits they can bring to your applications.

It is a client-server technology -- a way of making programs on two different systems work together like one. The advantage of RPC over other distributing programming techniques is that you can link two systems together using simple C calls, as in a single-system program.\n\nThe most common use for client-server is to combine the graphical display capabilities of a desk-top PC with the database and number-crunching power of a large central system. But peer-to-peer programs can run equally well.\n\nLike many aspects of Microsoft programming, RPC forms a small world of its own, with conventions and terms that can be confusing. But once you understand the purpose behind each feature, programming with RPC is not difficult. This book lays out the concepts and the programming tasks so that you can use this powerful API.\n\nMicrosoft RPC is a new technology based on the RPC used in the Distributed Computing Environment (DCE). This book builds on O'Reilly's successful DCE series. It provides a solid foundation for programmers learning to use Microsoft RPC, including:\n\nControlling communications through the Microsoft Interface Definition Languages (MIDL) and the Attribute Configuration File (ACF)The book contains:\nHow the server advertises itself\nHow a client chooses a server (binding)\nTypes of pointers and arrays\nMemory management\nAdministration tasks for an RPC server\n\nThis edition covers version 2.0 of Microsoft RPC.

This approach is more useful to develop readers’ grasp of how and why to apply processing techniques and ultimately process the mathematical foundations behind them.\n\nMuch more than just an arbitrary collection of algorithms, this is the rare book that goes beyond mere image improvement, presenting a wide range of powerful example images that illustrate techniques involved in color processing and enhancement. Applying his 50-year experience as a scientist, educator, and industrial consultant, John Russ offers the benefit of his image processing expertise for fields ranging from astronomy and biomedical research to food science and forensics. His valuable insights and guidance continue to make this handbook a must-have reference.","tags":["Software Development","Graphics Programming","Digital Image Processing"]},{"id":"9780749477592","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Risk Maturity Models","authors":["Domenic Antonucci"],"pages":"320","publication_date":"July 2016","description":"Assess the effectiveness of your organization's risk management protocols by creating and using a tailored risk maturity model brought by a chief risk officer.","tags":["Security","Governance, Risk Management and Compliance (GRC)","Operational Risk"]},{"id":"9781119122708","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"This is Environmental Ethics: An Introduction","authors":["Wendy Lynne Lee","Steven D.

Of the many disciplines addressing the ecological crisis, philosophy is perhaps best suited to develop the conceptual foundations of a viable and sustainable environmental ethic. This is Environmental Ethics provides an expansive overview of the key theories underpinning contemporary discussions of our moral responsibilities to non-human nature and living creatures.\n\nAdopting a critical approach, author Wendy Lynne Lee closely examines major moral theories to discern which ethic provides the compass needed to navigate the social, political, and economic challenges of potentially catastrophic environmental transformation, not only, but especially the climate crisis. Lee argues that the ethic ultimately adopted must make the welfare of non-human animals and plant life a priority in our moral decision-making, recognizing that ecological conditions form the existential conditions of all life on the planet. Throughout the text, detailed yet accessible chapters demonstrate why philosophy is relevant and useful in the face of an uncertain environmental future.\n\nQuestions which environmental theory might best address the environmental challenges of climate change and the potential for recurring pandemic\nDiscusses how inequalities of race, sex, gender, economic status, geography, and species impact our understanding of environmental dilemmas\nExplores the role of moral principles in making decisions to resolve real-world dilemmas\nIncorporates extensive critiques of moral extensionist and ecocentric arguments\nIntroduces cutting-edge work done by radical “deep green” writers, animal rights theorists, eco-phenomenologists, and ecofeminists\n\nThis is Environmental Ethics is essential reading for undergraduate students in courses on philosophy, geography, environmental studies, feminist theory, ecology, human and animal rights, and social justice, as well as an excellent graduate-level introduction to the key theories and thinkers of environmental philosophy.","tags":["Business","Operations","Green Business Practices"]},{"id":"9781805128281","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Unlocking the Power of Auto-GPT and Its Plugins","authors":["Wladislav Cugunov"],"pages":"142","publication_date":"September 2024","description":"Unlocking the Power of Auto-GPT and Its Plugins is your comprehensive guide to a game-changing tool in AI development.

For organizations that produce, manufacture or distribute products, there’s often a high level of interdependence and connectivity with their suppliers and their customers and business partners.\n\nAlthough the interconnectedness of these organizations can be beneficial (increased revenues, expanded market opportunities, and cost reduction), the ability of organizations to meet their goals is often increasingly dependent on events, processes, and controls that are not visible and are often beyond their control – such as a supplier’s controls. That’s why the demand for transparency in supply chains is now higher than ever before, and why this is the perfect time for you to help organizations assess their supply chain risks, evaluate the system controls within their manufacturing, production, or distribution systems, and communicate their supply chain management efforts to those with whom they do business.\n\nAccountants and financial managers can also increase the credibility of the supply chain information communicated by the organization by providing an opinion on the organization’s supply chain efforts. This guide enables the accountant and financial manager to examine and report on the description of a system for manufacturing, producing and distributing goods as well as on the controls within that system using a dynamic, proactive, and agile approach. It will show how to conduct this examination in accordance with the attestation standards. The guide may also be helpful when providing readiness assessments to clients, who are not quite ready for an examination level service and need help to get there.\n\nThe guide also includes excerpts from the two distinct, but complementary sets of criteria developed by the AICPA to assist practitioners with SOC for Supply Chain engagements: the description criteria and the 2017 trust services criteria.","tags":["Security","Governance, Risk Management and Compliance (GRC)","Compliance"]},{"id":"9781680505924","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Craft GraphQL APIs in Elixir with Absinthe","authors":["Bruce Williams","Ben Wilson"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"March 2018","description":"Your domain is rich and interconnected, and your API should be too.

Fortunately, several powerful new technologies have been developed specifically for use cases such as these. Big Data Analytics Beyond Hadoop is the first guide specifically designed to help you take the next steps beyond Hadoop. Dr. Vijay Srinivas Agneeswaran introduces the breakthrough Berkeley Data Analysis Stack (BDAS) in detail, including its motivation, design, architecture, Mesos cluster management, performance, and more. He presents realistic use cases and up-to-date example code for: \n\nSpark, the next generation in-memory computing technology from UC Berkeley\n\nStorm, the parallel real-time Big Data analytics technology from Twitter\n\nGraphLab, the next-generation graph processing paradigm from CMU and the University of Washington (with comparisons to alternatives such as Pregel and Piccolo)\n\nHalo also offers architectural and design guidance and code sketches for scaling machine learning algorithms to Big Data, and then realizing them in real-time. He concludes by previewing emerging trends, including real-time video analytics, SDNs, and even Big Data governance, security, and privacy issues. He identifies intriguing startups and new research possibilities, including BDAS extensions and cutting-edge model-driven analytics.\n\nBig Data Analytics Beyond Hadoop is an indispensable resource for everyone who wants to reach the cutting edge of Big Data analytics, and stay there: practitioners, architects, programmers, data scientists, researchers, startup entrepreneurs, and advanced students.","tags":["Data","Data Engineering","Hadoop"]},{"id":"9783110775228","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Business Ecosystems","authors":["Martin Reeves","Ulrich Pidun"],"pages":"162","publication_date":"October 2022","description":"A business ecosystem may be defined as a dynamic group of largely independent economic players that create products or services that together constitute a coherent solution for customers. Business ecosystems are high on the agenda of many business leaders. They are now highly prevalent, frequently disruptive, and all companies should add the required capabilities to their strategy toolbox.\n\nBusiness Ecosystems is based on more than three years of research by the BCG Henderson Institute, their work with dozens of companies on their ecosystem strategies, and hundreds of conversations with academics, managers, investors, entrepreneurs, and government employees. Part I reviews the fundamentals of business ecosystems – definition, design, success factors, governance, strategies. Part II elaborates on special topics, such as trust and data, industry applications, and their potential for sustainability.\n\nEcosystems might not be a solution for all problems, but they are also not a transitory phenomenon.

Exactly. Heck, the phrase “leading lines” in photography composition was first used back in the late 1700s, but after all this time, we’re still teaching these rules of composition. Why? It’s probably because they actually work pretty well, but they only scratch the surface of composition. After all, there has got to be more to great composition than just those rules or everybody would already be a composition master, right?\n\nThat’s what sets Crush the Composition apart. Written by photographer and best-selling author Scott Kelby, it’s the first book of its kind to take you beyond the time-honored rules of composition covered in every book on composition since the beginning of photography and share the concepts that nobody has been talking about—until now. These are some of the best-kept secrets in photography, and Scott unveils them all here in this groundbreaking new book whose layout and design put one leg in the classroom and one leg on the coffee table. You’re holding a book that has the power to transform the way you see, frame, and create images from this day forward because it will give you a clear plan of exactly what to do when you pick up your camera and start to frame up your shot.\n\nYou’ll learn exactly how to “work the scene” when it comes to photographing landscapes, travel, and even portraits, along with what to do first, what to do next, and how to move step by step through the process. Plus, you’ll learn:\n\n• What to do when the classic rules don’t apply (for example, what you can do if there are no leading lines or using the rule of thirds doesn’t work).\n\n• How to vary your settings and how it can change your composition. Plus, you’ll learn not only when to do it but, most importantly, why you’d want to in the first place.\n\n• How to add depth to your images, so they go from looking flat to having that deep, epic feeling that draws the viewer into your image.\n\n• How to compose for great-looking portraits and why certain composition decisions can make your subject look their very best.\n\n• How to use sharpness and depth of field to your advantage and how they play into your entire composition (it’s more powerful than you’d think).\n\nYou’ll also find a chapter on composition tips and tricks, and there’s even a short chapter that covers those classic rules of composition. But, instead of dedicating an entire chapter to each rule, each one is just one page—they’re short, sweet, and to the point, so you get them out of the way fast. They’re still valid, but the way Scott describes them, in his trademark casual style, all you’ll need is that one page and you’ll totally “get” them. That way, you can focus on the stuff that goes way beyond just those classic rules.\n\nIt’s all here in the only book of its kind, so get ready to rethink everything and come away with the type of images you’ve always dreamed of creating.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nChapter 1: Seeing Differently\n\nChapter 2: Work the Scene\n\nChapter 3: Change Your Perspective\n\nChapter 4: Work the Sharpness\n\nChapter 5: Work the Settings\n\nChapter 6: Add Depth to Your Composition\n\nChapter 7: The Power of Simplicity\n\nChapter 8: Composition for Portraits\n\nChapter 9: How to Critique Your Own Work\n\nChapter 10: Composition Tips\n\nChapter 11: The Classic Rules of Composition\n\nChapter 12: The Numbers Behind the Pixels","tags":["Design","Visual Design","Graphic Design","Typography"]},{"id":"9781805127567","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Building AI Applications with ChatGPT APIs","authors":["Martin Yanev"],"pages":"258","publication_date":"September 2023","description":"This book is your gateway to mastering AI application development using ChatGPT, Whisper, and DALL-E APIs.

The increasing need for natural resources has raised concerns regarding issues such as resource scarcity, undesirable environmental impacts due to material extraction, primary production, and suboptimal product disposal, and social or political tensions. Product End-of-Life (EoL) options, such as reusing or recycling, attempt to limit or reduce the amount of waste sent to a landfill, providing strategic means to decouple the link between economic growth and resource usage. These EoL options have the potential to close material loops, further utilizing wastes as resources, reducing environmental impacts, conserving natural resources, reducing material prices, and providing job opportunities in developing countries.Remanufacturing, on the other hand, is a unique EoL option due to increasing the number of life cycles of a product before final disposal. First, recurring environmental benefits, such as emission and raw material extraction avoidance are obtained with each additional product life cycle. Second, individual resource efficiency yields increase through product remanufacture. Resource efficiency or, using more with less will continue to compound with each additional life cycle. Third, recirculating products decreases the demand and dependency for primary resource production, further closing the material loop and creating a more circular economy. In addition, remanufacturing can initiate more preferable EoL options such as recovery, recycling, and waste reduction.\n\nWhile remanufacturing offers numerous benefits, there is significant lack of literature and books covering the fundamentals of operations, technologies and business models. The proposed book will provide in-depth coverage of remanufacturing fundamentals and its strong link to circular economy and resource efficiency.","tags":["Business","Operations","Green Business Practices"]},{"id":"9780814417447","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"The AMA Handbook of Financial Risk Management","authors":["John J.

However, even best-in-class organizations can falter in the face of extreme risk exposure. Special circumstances demand special responses, and extreme risk exposure needs very careful handling. Routine risk management approaches will fall short, but businesses that demonstrate a high degree of flexibility and resilience will have the competitive advantage and the ability to thrive where others fail.The causes and consequences of meteorological hurricanes have parallels in the way uncontrolled risk exposure can develop in organizations. Both are caused largely by predictable factors, but both are characterized by sustained uncertainty and severe impact once they develop. If we can learn to predict a risk hurricane, prepare for it effectively, and survive its effects, then our organizations will be well placed to address the challenge of extreme risk exposure, if and when we are unfortunate enough to face it.","tags":["Security","Governance, Risk Management and Compliance (GRC)","Operational Risk"]},{"id":"0321410181","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Real World Print Production","authors":["Claudia McCue"],"pages":"368","publication_date":"July 2006","description":"Translating inspiration to the printed page has always been a challenge.

It's inefficient at best, and with really hard problems there are simply too many variables for guessing to work. Greene shows you how to adopt the behaviors great problem solvers use to arrive at solutions efficiently—without guessing.

Once more unto the breach explains why information security is an ongoing process, using the role of project manager on a program of change to highlight the various incidents and issues that arise on an almost daily basis – and often go unnoticed.\n\nA major challenge for the ISM is achieving all-important buy-in from their colleagues. Once more unto the breach explains how to express the importance of the tasks you are undertaking in language that executive management will understand. You’ll also discover the importance of having a camera with you at all times.\n\nFor too long, security has been seen as more of an inhibitor than an enabler.

In Foundations of Sharī'ah Governance of Islamic Banks, Karim Ginena and Azhar Hamid explore the depths of sharī'ah governance to unravel its mysterious dimensions, and equip academics and practitioners with a solid understanding of the subject, which has become a serious challenge and thus deserves dedicated attention.\n\nThe authors make a strong case for the need to contain the sharī'ah risk that Islamic banks experience, and present a compelling argument for how this should be done. Ginena and Hamid propose a robust sharī'ah governance model that comprehensively tackles thisrisk, and helps improve the extent of sharī'ah compliance of market players. The authors detail the internal, external, and institutional arrangements needed to promote responsible sharī'ah governance, and critically analyze current laws, regulations, and industry practices on the topic. The chapters of the book do the following:\n\nExamine the roots, characteristics and objectives of sharī'ah and its relation to financial dealings;\nProbe the role of regulators in sharī'ah governance, explore the different approaches adopted by banking supervisors, and provide examples of relevant legal and regulatory measures;\nExplain to bank directors and management the fiduciary duty they assume with respect to sharī'ah compliance, and detail how they could discharge this responsibility in line with best practices;\nElaborate on the purpose of the Sharī'ah Supervisory Board (SSB), its responsibilities, competence criteria, internal regulations, and key governance guidelines; additionally, they explore different SSB models;\nDescribe the internal sharī'ah control system including its six components, and examine the internal sharī'ah audit function as well as different stages of conducting a sharī'ah audit;\nClarify the role of a sharī'ah auditor, with guidance on reporting lines, scope of duties, authority, and practical ways on fulfilling tasks, such as a sample sharī'ah risk assessment grid and audit checklists;\nDiscuss the newly emerging external sharī'ah advisory firms that are expected to play a key role in the coming years and the services they provide.\n\nThrough an effective treatment of each of these elements, and the way that they interact with one another, the book offers a fresh take on how robust sharī'ah governance of Islamic banks can be successfully accomplished. It is a comprehensive resource for academics, regulators, directors, lawyers, auditors, consultants, employees, and customers of Islamic banks interested in learning more about these challenges. This essential reading persuasively extends the discourse on the subject and addresses critical sharī'ah issues that have policy implications for decision makers in jurisdictions aiming to attract the fast-growing Islamic finance industry or increase their market share.","tags":["Security","Governance, Risk Management and Compliance (GRC)","Governance"]},{"id":"9781466583634","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The EIS Book","authors":["Charles H.

The globalization of corporations and widely publicized corporate misdeeds (e.g., Nike's child labor problems) has increased public scrutiny of corporate behavior. As pressure grows from a variety of stakeholders (e.g., investors, creditors, customers, and NGOs) for corporate transparency, sustainability reports provide vital information to meet the demand for disclosures about environmental, economic, and social impacts. In addition to addressing stakeholders' demands, this reporting enhances internal decision-making. Managers are better able to assess risks, monitor company resources, establish competitive advantage, create employee loyalty, and engage stakeholders. This book is intended for MBA students, executives, and managers who want to learn about the value of sustainability reporting. In this book, they will discover the internal and external benefits of sustainability reporting, the basics of existing reporting frameworks, and the reaction of the investment community. Detailed examples of sustainability metrics from numerous organizations are provided to illustrate the Global Reporting Initiative Sustainability Reporting Guidelines. This book will enable readers to assess how reporting can add value for his or her own organization.","tags":["Business","Operations","Green Business Practices"]},{"id":"9781492056850","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"GraphQL for Modern Commerce","authors":["Kelly Goetsch"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"February 2020","description":"REST APIs are great, but when you have to make individual requests to 10, 20, 30, or more of them to render a page or screen, they can become a bit cumbersome for your frontend developers. Facebook solved these challenges by inventing and later open-sourcing GraphQL.\n\nRather than requesting data from each API individually, GraphQL allows frontend developers to build a query asking for all of the data that’s needed, no matter which REST APIs actually contain the data. The GraphQL server then retrieves the data and returns it to the frontend developer in a single JSON document.

This book opens discussion about uncertainty in model parameters, model specifications, and model-driven forecasts in a way that standard statistical risk measurement does not.

Consequently, financiers could be hindered from developing a full understanding of the underwritten risks and are thus unable or only partially able to evaluate their full potential to expand financial relationships over the credit capability of a single counterparty with respect to the supplier–debtor pair.\n\nThe richness of the information available in trade credit financing is not an obstacle for the development of a modern risk management framework, but it must be calibrated to avoid distortions in the implementation. In addition, risk analysis in the supply chain is not limited to the crises of individual members but must assess the effects of such crisis on the entire supply chain and assess the specific risks of contagion and the favorable conditions for the propagation.

It presents a systematic analysis of the material and provides an account to the math development in a unified way.\n\nThe topics in this book are structured along four dimensions: Agent, Environment, Interaction, and Organization, while keeping global (system-centered) and local (agent-centered) viewpoints.\n\nThe focus is on the wide-sense consensus problem in discrete networked dynamic systems. The authors rely heavily on algebraic graph theory and topology to derive their results. It is known that graphs play an important role in the analysis of interactions between multiagent/distributed systems. Graph-theoretic analysis provides insight into how topological interactions play a role in achieving coordination among agents. Numerous types of graphs exist in the literature, depending on the edge set of G. A simple graph has no self-loop or edges. Complete graphs are simple graphs with an edge connecting any pair of vertices. The vertex set in a bipartite graph can be partitioned into disjoint non-empty vertex sets, whereby there is an edge connecting every vertex in one set to every vertex in the other set. Random graphs have fixed vertex sets, but the edge set exhibits stochastic behavior modeled by probability functions. Much of the studies in coordination control are based on deterministic/fixed graphs, switching graphs, and random graphs.\n\nThis book addresses advanced analytical tools for characterization control, estimation and design of networked dynamic systems over fixed, probabilistic and time-varying graphs\nProvides coherent results on adopting a set-theoretic framework for critically examining problems of the analysis, performance and design of discrete distributed systems over graphs\nDeals with both homogeneous and heterogeneous systems to guarantee the generality of design results","tags":["Data","Data Science","Data Science Tasks","Graph Analytics"]},{"id":"9781098163129","language":"en","level":null,"title":"ChatGPT Basics: Get an OpenAI API Key","authors":["J.

Ferrin"],"pages":"8","publication_date":"October 2017","description":"Multinational corporations spend millions of dollars per year on compliance. In highly regulated industries, such as health care and finance, large companies spend much more, sometimes hiring hundreds or even thousands of compliance officers at a time. There is often a belief on the part of corporate leaders that when rigorous compliance programs are in place, employee wrongdoing will largely disappear. If something does go wrong, the hope is that having a comprehensive program will help convince regulators that the company’s compliance initiatives were “effective,” the standard used in U.S. sentencing guidelines. Unfortunately, even today’s most comprehensive programs won’t curtail corporate wrongdoing or the government intervention that follows. Volkswagen AG’s compliance program didn’t stop its employees from installing “defeat device” software to cheat emissions tests, nor did Wells Fargo & Co.’s policies prevent its employees from opening new customer accounts without authorization. More than 15 years after the Enron Corp. scandal, most companies know very little about how employees make ethical decisions or the psychological mechanisms that cause them to perform unethical and illegal acts. Even fewer have compliance strategies aimed at curbing such behaviors.The goal of this article is to pull together the burgeoning field of behavioral ethics, which provides insight into how individuals make ethical decisions, with the work of criminologists who study individual and corporate criminality. The author seeks to explain why corporate compliance efforts are falling short and how those efforts can be improved. In addition, he offers practical and cost-effective strategies for improving compliance programs that focus on employee behavior, which he says is the best way to make compliance truly effective. Corporate compliance depends on the behavior of individual employees. If employees, officers, and managers always acted in a law-abiding and ethical manner, compliance failures would rarely occur. But that is not realistic. That is why companies need to be aware of how and why employees act the way they do. This starts with understanding how people make decisions generally and how that translates to ethical decision-making. The article describes eight common rationalizations used by those committing unethical and illegal acts within companies. Corporate leaders need to understand these rationalizations and be able to identify their usage as part of an effective compliance program. The author acknowledges that no compliance program will entirely eliminate bad employee conduct. But behaviorally cognizant programs, ones that seek to understand employee decision-making and target the cognitive mechanisms that foster unethicality, hold the promise of reducing unethical and illegal behavior within a company.","tags":["Security","Governance, Risk Management and Compliance (GRC)","Compliance"]},{"id":"9781101198094","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide Music Dictionary","authors":["Dr. Stanford Felix"],"pages":"336","publication_date":"July 2010","description":"A musician's vocabulary needs more than Do, Re, Mi...Written in clear, concise, easy-to-understand language, The Complete Idiot's Guide® Music Dictionary covers a multitude of musical aspects indispensable to any musician.

In Fully Compliant, Travis Waugh challenges traditional compliance training that simply ensures employees avoid the legal risk of failing to comply with a specific mandate. With an ever-increasing number of compliance subjects to address, such programs are unsustainable. Instead, organizations must design compliance programs that serve a higher, broader purpose and build robust, resilient cultures focusing on integrity and ethics learning. Optimal compliance programs are flexible and create real learning experiences that change real behavior, thus diminishing the chance of misconduct in the first place. This book connects the three levers of human behavior―context, habits, and motivation―to compliance and how you can pull all three to create holistic training programs that do far more than check a box. It identifies ways to pick up small but meaningful wins in turning around an existing compliance program or designing a new course, which can turn stakeholders from skeptics into learning champions. And it offers an eight-step road map for implementing your own compliance learning plan. With this book, you'll be able to: • Create behavior-based compliance training that generates measurable benefits.• Make compliance training more engaging and impactful, not one size fits all.• Remain relevant as advances in technology shift compliance expectations in the years ahead.

Also covered are instructions for how to greatly increase your graphics capabilities using transformations, which allow you to move, stretch, or rotate graphics. They also let you work in coordinate systems that make sense for your application. The author also describes techniques for using the above in printouts, describing the sequence of events that produce a printout and show how to generate and preview printouts, with examples which show how to wrap long chunks of text across multiple pages, if necessary.\n\nIn addition, you will learn about two powerful new graphic tools that were introduced with .NET Framework 3.0: WPF graphics and FlowDocuments. XAML graphic commands allow a WPF application to draw and fill the same kinds of shapes that a program can draw by using graphics objects.\n\nFinally, a discussion on the FlowDocument object shows you how to define items that should be flowed across multiple pages as space permits. This lets you display text, graphics, controls, and other items that automatically flow across page breaks. FlowDocument viewers make displaying these documents easy for you, and simplifies the user's reading of the documents.\n\nThis Wrox Blox also contains 35 example programs written in Visual Basic 2008, although most of the code works in previous versions of Visual Basic .NET as well.

As regulatory demands ever increasing, it is important for operations teams to be aware of the important regulatory issues which exist globally. Like any other part of an organization in the financial services industry, operations has rules and regulations to comply with. Although many view regulation as being about rooting out rogue traders and controlling speculators, its role is much more profound than this, and without it many more 'scandals' would undoubtedly occur. The problem for the regulator is that unless total oversight of every transaction, account, business and individual can be made, there will always be rogue traders or more recent examples like Enron and World.Com. As such intense oversight is not practical, the regulator can only do so much, with most of the responsibility resting with the firms and organizations themselves.For operations teams their role in protecting the firm stems from their ability to manage critical processes like reconciliation, asset position agreements and the nostro accounts efficiently and effectively. Regulators need the help and support of the businesses to have a 'business-friendly environment'. When some abuse the trust placed in them and the regulatory environment, a 'scandal' or worse occurs, with the result that the majority are penalized as regulators react to criticism and apply more onerous regulations.It is often the operations teams that bear most, or at least some, of the repercussions of greater regulatory oversight of the business. It is therefore vitally important for operations teams to have a firm understanding of the regulatory issues and drivers. This book will help you gain that understanding, as well as looking at the important regulatory issues in the various global markets in which your business operates.* This book completes the popular Securities Institute Operations Management Series* Explains the role of regulation and compliance in UK, US and global financial markets* Provides a valuable perspective from the operations department viewpoint without getting caught up in the minute details of regulations","tags":["Security","Governance, Risk Management and Compliance (GRC)","Compliance"]},{"id":"9781592535798","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Letterhead & Logo Design 10","authors":["Sussner Design"],"pages":"240","publication_date":"November 2009","description":"This new-in-paperback edition, part of the bestselling annual Letterhead and Logo Design series, features the most innovative and exciting work in the field from well-known design leaders, new design firms, and cutting-edge artists.","tags":["Design","Visual Design","Graphic Design"]},{"id":"9780321498823","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"OpenGL SuperBible: Comprehensive Tutorial and Reference, Fourth Edition","authors":["Richard S.

Attention to important stakeholders outside the sector, e.g. policy makers and the field of education, makes this book comprehensive. A more encompassing view on ICT and sustainability is offered to the reader and, as such, managers in higher education, educators, CIO’s, policymakers and regulators are inspired to integrate their efforts and to contribute to a transition of one of the most important and prominent sectors in our global economy.","tags":["Business","Operations","Green Business Practices"]},{"id":"9781000207590","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Green Information and Communication Systems for a Sustainable Future","authors":["Rajshree Srivastava","Sandeep Kautish","Rajeev Tiwari"],"pages":"272","publication_date":"November 2020","description":"This book includes the fundamental concepts, applications, algorithms, protocols, new trends, challenges, and research results in the area of Green Information and Communication Systems.

Aside from the projected doubling of food consumption in the next fifty years, the growing trade of biofuels and other commodities is a global challenge as the economic activities in the primary sector (i.e. mining, fisheries, aquaculture, forestry and agriculture) can damage biodiversity and ecosystem services. This should be taken into account in the decision-making affecting the global value chains linking consumer, retailer, processor, and producer in the North and the South.\n\nTo cover the topic of ecosystem services and global trade this book is organized into four major parts. Part 1 gives the theoretical framework from an ecological, economic and political perspectives. Part 2 explores how internationally traded biophysical commodities from agriculture, forestry and fisheries translates into a virtual flow of land, freshwater, and marine ecosystems. Part 3 describes how two widely used accounting tools (i.e., Life Cycle Assessment and Green National Accounts) deal with international aspects of ecosystem services, and Part 4 shows how instruments like labelling, bans, or payments for ecosystem services in the private and public sector can influence trade patterns and the management of ecosystem services.\n\nThis collection is a valuable contribution to the global change science dealing with ecosystem services. It illustrates the consequences of international trade on global ecosystem services and provides an overview of accounting tools and of market-based policy instruments to address negative and positive externalities. The book is certainly innovative, because it brings together research findings from distinct disciplines especially Industrial Ecology and Ecosystem Sciences, as well as Environmental Economics and Political Science.","tags":["Business","Operations","Green Business Practices"]},{"id":"9781637421543","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Transparency in ESG and the Circular Economy","authors":["Dolan Cristina","Diana Barrero Zalles"],"pages":"176","publication_date":"November 2021","description":"A holistic view of ESG goes beyond environmental issues, which are closely linked to social issues.

These included the election of Barack Obama as US president; the brief war in Georgia, which caused the West to look at Russia with more watchful eyes; and a cataclysmic crisis in the worlds financial markets that seemed to threaten globalisation and even capitalism, and to herald a period of greater economic austerity. Even as these events occurred, the security issues and risks that have been the core focus of the work of the IISS during the past half-century continued to loom large, among them nuclear proliferation and the relations between the major powers. In addition to these perennial themes was another set of issues that has in recent times risen higher on the international security agenda, including the security ramifications of natural disasters and environmental dangers such as climate change. In its anniversary year, the IISS held several high-level conferences around the world.

The speakers were statesmen, senior military officers, high officials and international security experts.

It focuses on the importance of the nature of the language of the political discourse on sustainability and how ideas are communicated amongst the actors and stakeholders in the policy making process, as well as assessing the conceptual, political, institutional and operational barriers apparent across the European geographic region. Drawing case studies from numerous policy areas including climate change, EU emissions trading scheme, renewable energy, nuclear energy, the European integrated energy market, transport mobility, and environmental protection, expert contributors unveil a narrowing of the discourse on sustainability that has taken place in Europe. However, a considerable discontinuity remains between the economic and environmental objectives of sustainable development, and the authors argue that it is essential that conditions for a dynamic discourse, open to multiple participants, are developed.\n\nSustainable Development and Governance in Europe will be of strong interest to students and scholars of comparative politics, governance, sustainable development and environmental politics and studies.","tags":["Business","Operations","Green Business Practices"]},{"id":"9780134021430","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Amazon Fire Phone: Master your Amazon smartphone including Firefly, Mayday, Prime, and all the top apps","authors":["Scott McNulty"],"pages":"240","publication_date":"October 2014","description":"This affordable and engaging guide is packed with practical information to help you get the most from your new Amazon Fire smartphone.

While it is common for “society” to be identified as an organizational stakeholder, the reality is that one company cannot, acting on its own, achieve all the goals associated with societal wellbeing. However, every company, regardless of its size, can make a difference in some small, yet meaningful way, in the communities in which they operate, and more and more attention is being focused on the impact that companies have within their communities. Focusing on the community level allows an organization to set meaningful targets and implement programs that fit the scale of its operations and which can provide the most immediate value to the organization and its stakeholders.

Each contributor to New Approaches on Energy and the Environment was asked to address the question: 'Based on your research and knowledge, what policy recommendation would you like to make to the next U.S. president?' Writing in advance of the 2004 election so as to keep their essays free of partisan interpretations, the authors were asked not to confine their suggestions to what the prevailing wisdom says is politically possible. They also took pains to make their ideas accessible to a busy president as well as a wide range of readers interested in a concise and authoritative overview of the nation's energy and environmental policy choices. The results are provocative, sometimes controversial, but highly readable essays on topics including climate change, oil dependency, electricity regulation, brownfields revitalization, forest service administration, air and water quality, and environmental health issues such as food safety and the growing threat of antibiotic resistance. When the President takes office in January, 2005, he will confront competing perspectives about the priorities and approaches that should apply to energy and environmental policy: Americans want cleaner air and water and healthy and attractive surroundings, but they also want inexpensive fuel, comfortable cars and houses, and continued economic growth.

It is contended that these problems have been seen as the major challenges facing the Chinese economy, and further, that the current weakness of corporate governance practices in China can be ascribed, to a great extent, to the incompleteness and weakness of law enforcement.","tags":["Security","Governance, Risk Management and Compliance (GRC)","Governance"]},{"id":"9781951527860","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Sustainability Leader in a Green Business Era","authors":["Amr E.

At the urging of citizens, nongovernmental organizations, and industry, government officials at all levels have experimented with collaboration. Yet questions remain about the roles that governments play in collaboration--whether they are constructive and support collaboration, or introduce barriers. This thoughtful book analyzes a series of cases to understand how collaborative processes work and whether government can be an equal partner even as government agencies often formally control decision making and are held accountable for the outcomes. Looking at examples where government has led, encouraged, or followed in collaboration, the authors assess how governmental actors and institutions affected the way issues were defined, the resources available for collaboration, and the organizational processes and structures that were established. Cases include collaborative efforts to manage watersheds, rivers, estuaries, farmland, endangered species habitats, and forests. The authors develop a new theoretical framework and demonstrate that government left a heavy imprint in each of the efforts.

Those who don't make visible progress toward that goal within the first year or two will likely find themselves looking for another job. It is precisely because of this growing breakthrough imperative that managers today, whether in corporations or nonprofits, need to get off to a fast start. They don't have time for mistakes or for going back and redoing what they should have done right in the first place.\n\nBut, despite the intensity of these pressures, despite the high expectations and short time frames, a number of CEOs and general managers turn in truly exceptional results. How do they meet and exceed the breakthrough imperative? To answer this question, consultants and former managers Mark Gottfredson and Steve Schaubert interviewed more than forty CEOs from both industry and the nonprofit sector, conducted an intensive study of what successful managers do right—and what some do wrong—and drew on their own combined fifty-plus years of experience at Bain & Company, where their insights have consistently been found in the pages of the Harvard Business Review. Together they came up with the four straightforward principles—deceptively simple yet remarkably powerful—that everyone must follow to succeed at achieving breakthrough results:\n\n1. Costs and prices always decline\n2. Competitive position determines options\n3. Customers and profit pools don't stand still\n4. Simplicity gets results\n\nAlthough seemingly simplistic, mastering these four laws means mastering the basics of great management—a foundation on which to build the rest of one's management strategy. Whether you're managing a small work group or a multinational corporation, a single division or an entire nonprofit, The Breakthrough Imperative presents these core laws of business to help you determine where you are, just how far you can go, and how to get there with stellar results.","tags":["Data","Data Science","Web Analytics","Google Analytics"]},{"id":"9781491905272","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Programming Chrome Apps","authors":["Marc Rochkind"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"December 2014","description":"Put your web app design skills to work by learning how to create powerful and portable Chrome Apps.

Faced with constantly advancing technology, unpredictable market shifts, intense global competition, and an increasingly independent \"free agent\" workforce, the only way for an organization to adapt and succeed is to build a \"culture of inclusion\" that nurtures and draws on the talents of a diverse workforce.Easy to say but hard to do; most organizations are mired in industrial revolution, static-world business models administered by monocultural, bordering-on-oppressive, \"command and control\" hierarchies. Organizations at risk include Fortune 500 giants, entrepreneurial start-ups, manufacturing and retail operations, government agencies, not-for-profits, educational institutions, and others.Most organizational change efforts-whether labeled as diversity efforts, re-engineering, right-sizing, or total-quality-management-are a waste of time, money, and human effort. Most produce more cynicism than results, and they can poison the waters for future change efforts. The Inclusion Breakthrough cuts a path through this potential minefield, offering a proven methodology for strategic organizational change, including models for diagnosing, planning, and implementing inclusion-focused, culture-change strategies tailored to each organization's individual needs. It also describes the key competencies for leading and sustaining a culture of inclusion.Offering real-world results of \"before and after\" surveys, including anecdotal and statistical reports of organizational change achieved using the methodologies described, The Inclusion Breakthrough presents an overview of current workplace conditions, attitudes, and policies based on interviews, surveys, and focus groups encompassing thousands of people in major organizations. The Inclusion Breakthrough demonstrates why the bottom line must be the central focus of any change strategy-and more importantly, how to carry that strategy out successfully.","tags":["Data","Data Science","Web Analytics","Google Analytics"]},{"id":"9780071823029","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Google Maps","authors":["Evangelos Petroutsos"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"March 2014","description":"Create custom applications with the Google Maps API\n\nFeaturing step-by-step examples, this practical resource gets you started programming the Google Maps API with JavaScript in no time.

Although companies originally moved production offshore to countries such as India and China to take advantage of lower labor costs, events such as Iceland’s 2010 volcanic eruption and the Japanese tsunami in 2011 have shown that the vulnerabilities of extended supply chains are real and serious.\n\nLean supply-chain practices, designed to keep costs low in a stable business environment, can increase risk levels during disruptions due to the lack of buffer capacity. While companies tend to focus on the supply side of their supply chains when scanning for potential risk factors, they also need to pay attention to the customer side.\n\nApproaches to risk management such as enterprise risk management (ERM) and business continuity management (BCM) can help companies avoid supply-chain disruptions and recover normal operations quickly. But in the authors’ view, they rely too heavily on risk identification when many of the risks are unpredictable or unknowable before the fact. They also depend on statistical information that may not exist and address each risk independently. Finally, they are predicated on the goal of returning to a stable operating condition.\n\nBased on their work with a number of companies, including fashion retailer L Brands Inc. (formerly known as Limited Brands), Dow Chemical, Johnson &Johnson and Unilever, the authors present a comprehensive framework for assessing supply-chain vulnerabilities and addressing them through enhanced resilience capabilities. The framework, which they call Supply Chain Resilience Assessment and Management (SCRAM), is based on an explicit characterization and prioritization of the vulnerabilities that make an organization susceptible to disruptions, and the capabilities that help an organization anticipate and overcome disruptions. The framework is designed to help companies identify their most important supply-chain vulnerabilities and to set priorities for capabilities that need to be strengthened.","tags":["Security","Governance, Risk Management and Compliance (GRC)","Operational Risk"]},{"id":"9781564148407","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"How to Spot a Liar","authors":["Gregory Hartley","Maryann Karinch"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"September 2005","description":"An International Spy Museum Bestseller!\n\nHave you ever been lied to?

While most enterprise risk management guides are written for traditional businesses and finance firms, this book translates effective enterprise risk and opportunity management (EROM) principles into strategies and practices that work for government, nonprofit, and for-profit organizations in the technological space. Originally designed for noncommercial pioneering enterprises like NASA, an entire chapter is now devoted toward applying the methods to profit-making technological enterprises.\n\nA 40-year veteran of the tech sector, Dr. Allan Benjamin outlines risk management strategies for organizations in which the advancement and integration of science and technology within complex systems is necessary for accomplishment of the mission. Commercial EROM strategies do not translate directly when the development and implementation of risky technologies is the organization's primary objective, and clumsy or near-sighted implementation can easily cripple progress. This book provides authoritative guidance tailored to the sector's specialized needs.\n\nMaximize opportunity while effectively managing risk\nUnderstand the core principles of the technological EROM approach and its interfaces with the management of the organization\nComprehend the intricacies of aggregating risks and opportunities from lower to higher levels of the organization\nGain expert insights specific to the technology sector\nMitigate and control the risk that comes with pursuing discovery\n\nIn practice, EROM in this sector involves working with mostly qualitative data, and is characterized by high uncertainty. Managing risk without handicapping the organization requires a specific set of adjustments to traditional EROM, and a more nuanced approach to the idea of \"acceptable risk. Balance is key in technological EROM, and Enterprise Risk and Opportunity Management provides foundational guidance, real-world strategy, and enlightening examples for getting it right.","tags":["Security","Governance, Risk Management and Compliance (GRC)","Operational Risk"]},{"id":"9780124705050","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Binary Digital Image Processing","authors":["Stéphane Marchand-Maillet","Yazid M.

This, the only book to cover the last ten years of the OECD’s work, focuses on the policy-related advice, evidence-based global standards, trusted statistics and analysis, and support for policy reform that it has developed.\n\nThe book commences with a brief history of the OECD and its key decision processes and then examines the impact of its leadership in driving a wide range of achievements and in securing an expanding, increasingly global role. It focuses on the organisation’s green agenda and the move to measure living conditions in a more detailed fashion, rather than relying largely on GDP, and on the inclusive growth project that aims at making markets work for all. It discusses the OECD’s remarkably influential work in education, including PISA and PIAAC, and demonstrates the capacity of the OECD to embrace new areas of work – the importance of innovation and the digital economy in driving economic growth.\n\nBased on access to a wide range of documents and extensive interviews with senior officials and members, this comprehensive book also sheds light on the OECD’s partnership with the G20 in the push for stronger international co-operation and transparency in tax matters as well their Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit shifting (BEPS), aimed at tackling tax avoidance.

This is because the amount of money they are spending on the electricity for IT systems is often hidden inside the bigger electricity bill. Many businesses have already been confronted with the heavy operational costs associated with increased data storage. So unless you keep track of the problem, your business may be pouring money down the drain without you even realising it. If you care at all about growth, this is a form of waste you cannot afford. Moreover, a sudden rise in electricity prices may even push your company into making disruptive, short-term cuts.\n\nBrand equity\n\nHeavy use of electricity also has a negative impact on the environment. Generating electricity usually requires the burning of fossil fuels, which releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. In today's business climate, environmental irresponsibility results in bad publicity, and leads to awkward questions from both customers and investors. Getting to grips with energy consumption is one way for you to protect your company's reputation.\n\nWhat gets measured gets done\n\nThis book's message has nothing to do with greenwash. It is intended for people who are looking for hard, practical advice on how to fix a problem. Green IT needs to establish baseline data so that progress can be effectively tracked, and metrics are essential for that. Taking Green IT seriously also means coming up with a plan and making sure it gets delivered. So it is vital to treat Green IT as a process. You need to make the CIO responsible for the energy consumption of the data centre, and allow him to do what it takes to drive costs down. To retain momentum, your Green IT strategy also needs the support of top management. Meanwhile, lower down the hierarchy, employees need to know that Green IT is not just a fad, but something your company is treating as a real priority.\n\nBenefits to business include:\n\nManage power demand Once servers start to become overloaded with work, more servers have to be installed, meaning increased consumption of electricity. However, by finding a way to change working patterns so that you run more batch jobs in off-peak hours, you can reduce both power and investment costs.\nDecommission useless equipment Up to 30 per cent of the servers in a data centre may be abandoned, and yet they will still be consuming electricity. Once you have identified the equipment that has fallen into disuse, you can get rid of it and start saving electricity.\nGet help Government agencies and utility companies are now committed to helping businesses lower their energy consumption. Your electricity provider may offer you support here, while many governments also offer tax incentives towards adopting Green IT\nAccentuate the positive The digital world makes for greater efficiency, and a Green IT initiative can treat IT as an opportunity for saving energy.

Along with the reform, the corporate governance structure has been established accordingly. The Chinese Corporate Governance Index (CCGI?NK) is a useful tool to objectively observe and analyze shareholder behavior, board execution, management incentive and restriction, supervisory committee operation, information disclosure and stakeholders' interest protection, and is helpful in diagnosing issues that may arise during corporate operations. The CCGI?NK provides guidance for improvement of corporate governance, and can be used to enhance the sustainable development of corporations.--Chen Qing-Tai, Vice Director, Economic Committee, National Committee of Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), Former Vice Director of Development and Research Center of the State Council Dean, Public Administration School of Tsinghua University\n\nThe phenomenal growth of China's capital markets during the past decade belies the fact that Chinese companies have only gradually adopted modern corporate governance structures. Professor Li's book offers a candid and timely assessment of the quality of the governance mechanisms they employ including the factors that influence their quality and how they relate to subsequent corporate performance. A proper understanding is critical for global investors with an interest in China's markets and for scholars who seek to disentangle corporate governance theory and practice in a fascinating market place. --G. Andrew Karolyi, Charles R. Webb Professor of Finance The Ohio State University\n\nCorporate governance is a vital issue that China listing companies and enterprises has to deal with. This book reports an important investigation on the subject of corporate governance. As a major result of the study, a series of governance indices conforming to China's situation were proposed in the book. The author of the book hence received the Award of Outstanding Contribution in Chinese Enterprise Management, and I was very pleased to preside the ceremony to present him with this prestigious award. --Cheng Si-Wei, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of National People's Congress, Vice President of Fudan Management Award Foundation\n\nCorporate governance issues are important around the world. The ability of a firm to raise capital, to align with partners, and ultimately, to sell products and services to customers, all depend, to some extent, on the quality of corporate governance. This is why the research reported here is so important. That it focuses on corporate governance among Chinese corporations makes it all the more important. With only a limited history of publicly-traded firms, Chinese firms are inventing--right now--the kinds of corporate governance they will need to compete in global markets. It is hard to imagine a more timely research endeavor. --Jay B.

After a quick review of GWT fundamentals, GWT in Practice presents scores of handy, reusable solutions to the problems you face when you need to move beyond \"Hello World\" and \"proof of concept\" applications. This book skips the theory and looks at the way things really work when you're building projects in GWT.\n\nGWT in Practice shows you where GWT fits into the Enterprise Java developer's toolset. Written by expert authors Robert Cooper and Charlie Collins, this book combines sharp insight with hard-won experience. Readers will find thorough coverage of all aspects of GWT development from the basic GWT concepts and essentials to in-depth and complete real world example applications. If you know the basics and are ready to get your hands dirty, then you need this book.\n\nAbout the Technology\n\nIf you're a web developer, you already know that you can use Ajax to add rich, user-friendly, dynamic features to your applications. With the Google Web Toolkit (GWT), a new Ajax tool from Google that automatically converts Java to JavaScript, you can build Ajax applications using the Java language. GWT lets you focus on application design and functionality, rather than on browser differences, and allows you to re-use code throughout the layers of your applications.\n\nAbout the Book\n\nThe first part of the book is a rapid introduction to the GWT methodology. All of the basics of GWT development are covered in this portion, including a client side standalone application and basic server side communications using the GWT Remote Procedure Call (RPC) and object serialization mechanism.\n\nThe second part of the book then delves into several practical examples which further demonstrate core aspects of the toolkit. These include:\n\nUsing the GWT APIs\nGWT methods for communicating with servers\nEvent-driven programming approach used with the toolkit\nSupport for JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)\nNative JavaScript integration with the JSNI\nPackaging and deployment of GWT applications\nTesting with JUnit.\n\nThe book concludes by presenting several larger GWT applications including drag and drop support for UI elements, data binding, processing streaming data, handling application state, automated builds, and continuous integration.\n\nAlong the way GWT in Practice covers many additional facets of working with the toolkit. Various development tools are used throughout the book, including Eclipse, NetBeans, IDEA, Ant, Maven, and, of course, the old fashioned command line.

Aside from the projected doubling of food consumption in the next fifty years, the growing trade of biofuels and other commodities is a global challenge as the economic activities in the primary sector (i.e. mining, fisheries, aquaculture, forestry and agriculture) can damage biodiversity and ecosystem services. This should be taken into account in the decision-making affecting the global value chains linking consumer, retailer, processor, and producer in the North and the South.\n\nTo cover the topic of ecosystem services and global trade this book is organized into four major parts. Part 1 gives the theoretical framework from an ecological, economic and political perspectives. Part 2 explores how internationally traded biophysical commodities from agriculture, forestry and fisheries translates into a virtual flow of land, freshwater, and marine ecosystems. Part 3 describes how two widely used accounting tools (i.e., Life Cycle Assessment and Green National Accounts) deal with international aspects of ecosystem services, and Part 4 shows how instruments like labelling, bans, or payments for ecosystem services in the private and public sector can influence trade patterns and the management of ecosystem services.\n\nThis collection is a valuable contribution to the global change science dealing with ecosystem services. It illustrates the consequences of international trade on global ecosystem services and provides an overview of accounting tools and of market-based policy instruments to address negative and positive externalities. The book is certainly innovative, because it brings together research findings from distinct disciplines especially Industrial Ecology and Ecosystem Sciences, as well as Environmental Economics and Political Science.","tags":["Business","Operations","Green Business Practices"]},{"id":"53863MIT66202","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Don’t Bet Against the Move to Clean Energy","authors":["Steven Goldbach","Geoff Tuff","Derek Pankratz"],"pages":"5","publication_date":"September 2024","description":"The transition to a low-carbon economy is inevitable and accelerating, although progress might not always be smooth.

The next few chapters explain how to enhance the energy efficiency of a large-scale computing system via compiler-directed energy optimizations, an adaptive run-time system, and a general prediction performance framework. The book then explores the interactions between energy management and reliability and describes storage system organization that maximizes energy efficiency and reliability. It also addresses the need for coordinated power control across different layers and covers demand response policies in computing centers.

As organizations tackle global challenges, the faces of our businesses and our economic system are changing to consider the interests of all stakeholders rather than just shareholders. This book provides a step-by-step approach for organizations to reap benefits from a more sustainable approach. It begins with a brief history of the concept of sustainability as it applies to both performance and reporting. Implementing sustainability in an organization begins with the development of policies which are consistent with the expectations of its stakeholders. An organization’s active participation in multi-stakeholder initiatives helps to align the policies with societal trends. Once the policies are developed, a management system is crucial to ensure congruence of policies with actual performance. Then, periodic reporting of performance based on well-recognized standards aids stakeholders in assessing an organization’s performance–reporting also helps stakeholders to determine if performance aligns with their expectations. Both internal and external assurances build stakeholder trust in the organization’s performance and reporting. Finally, the book concludes with a reflection on key messages and potential future actions for continuous improvement.","tags":["Business","Operations","Green Business Practices"]},{"id":"53863MIT67111","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Planetary KPIs That Inform Eco-Friendly Strategies","authors":["Amanda Williams","Paolo Perego","Gail Whiteman"],"pages":"5","publication_date":"August 2025","description":"Sustainability targets for many businesses often yield incremental improvements that focus on minimizing harm instead of generating positive impacts.

A collaboration of scholars in the Transnational Initiative on Governance Research and Education (TIGRE Net), Making Multilevel Public Management Work: Stories of Success and Failure from Europe and North America brings together two strands of literature—multilevel governance and public management—and draws conclusions on practices of public management in multilevel governance settings.The book focuses on how to make multilevel public management work. Using an inductive logic, the editors study a particular case or a few selected cases, highlight lessons learned and implications, and identify trends and concerns. The book underscores factors essential to making multilevel public management work, namely coordination and collaboration, and new skills and leadership capacities. It discusses the pitfalls of creating networks instead of managing them and the importance of finding the right leadership skills, institutional design, and network management mechanisms to avoid deadlock and manage conflict effectively.Multilevel public management creates multiple opportunities and their accompanying challenges. By bringing together case studies in Europe and North America, this book identifies conditions for success and those under which such governance arrangements fail.

The old stereotype of green products’ sub-par performance has been shattered as large multinational corporations prove that you can develop and win in the marketplace with a naturals-based product platform. And the pull for sustainably minded products is not limited to consumer marketing—business-to-business marketing of greener products has also increased due to customer demand from all business sectors.\n\nThe Case for Greener Products\n\nMaking a compelling business case for why companies must provide greener, more sustainable products, Greener Products: The Making and Marketing of Sustainable Brands shares best practices for the design and marketing of greener products. The book examines ecosystem and regulatory pressures as well as market pressures from customers—consumers, business customers, and government purchasers—who have created a demand on manufacturers to bring more sustainable brands to market.\n\nHow Are Greener Products Made?\n\nThrough case studies of green design from companies such as GE (Ecomagination™), Timberland (Green Index®), Philips, Apple Inc., Seventh Generation, Procter & Gamble, BASF, and others, the author explores initiatives in areas ranging from product design, sustainable sourcing, and packaging to energy efficiency, recycling, and end-of-life management. A contribution from guest author James A. Fava, one of the leading thinkers and practitioners in developing greener products, presents a toolbox of environmental management systems, programs, and tools for the development of greener products.\n\nThree Keys to Successful Green Marketing Campaigns\n\nProviding the backbone for the author’s analysis of green marketing, a contribution from guest authors Lee Ann Head, Karen Barnes, and Suzanne Shelton of the Shelton Group analyzes market trend data and helps marketers understand their customers and what moves them. The author then looks more closely at drivers for green marketing, outlining three keys for successful green marketing campaigns and using them to evaluate the approaches of several leading companies. He also offers advice on how to avoid \"greenwashing,\" create successful cause-marketing partnerships, and use eco-labels wisely.\n\nThroughout the book, the author shares best practices and lessons learned from leaders in the field across various industry sectors.

The growing number of desalination plants worldwide and the increasing size of single facilities emphasises the need for greener desalination technologies and more sustainable desalination projects. Two complementing approaches are the development and implementation of best available technology (BAT) standards and best practice guidelines for environmental impact assessment (EIA) studies. While BAT is a technology-based approach, which favours state of the art technologies that reduce resource consumption and waste emissions, EIA aims at minimizing impacts at a site- and project-specific level through environmental monitoring, evaluation of impacts, and mitigation where necessary. This book contains a comprehensive evaluation and synthesis of the potential environmental impacts of desalination plants, with emphasis on the marine environment and aspects of energy use, followed by the development of strategies for impact mitigating. A concept for BAT for seawater desalination technologies is proposed, in combination with a methodological approach for the EIA of desalination projects. The scope of the EIA studies are outlined, including environmental monitoring, toxicity and hydrodynamic modelling studies, and the usefulness of multi-criteria analysis as a decision support tool for EIAs is explored and used to compare different intake and pretreatment options for seawater reverse osmosis plants.","tags":["Business","Operations","Green Business Practices"]},{"id":"9780132466929","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Trends Are an Investor’s Best Friend","authors":["Tom Lydon"],"pages":"10","publication_date":"February 2010","description":"This Element is an excerpt from The ETF Trend Following Playbook: Profiting from Trends in Bull or Bear Markets with Exchange Traded Funds (ISBN: 9780137029013) by Tom Lydon.

It does so from the perspectives of book history, literary history, especially emblem scholarship, and art history. The various contributions to the volume address issues such as those of the adoption of printer's devices in the place of the older heraldic printer's marks as a symptom of the changing self-image of the representatives of the Early Modern printing profession, of the mutual influence of emblems and printer's marks, of the place of Classical learning in the design of Humanist printer's marks, of the economic factors involved in the evolution of Early Modern printer's marks, the pictorial topics of the Early Modern printer's mark, and the printer's mark as a result of the 'Verbürgerlichung' of the device of Early Modern nobility. Special care was taken to account for the similarities and differences of the printer's marks produced and used in different regional and cultural contexts.

At the broadest level, business managers are being advised to embrace regulation as a source of competitive advantage rather than viewing it simply as a compliance cost and administrative burden. Irrespective of whether managers accept that “going beyond compliance” is a stimulus for innovation, business managers frequently face a policy environment in which choices need to be made over how policy agendas should be responded to. Contemporary policy approaches may mandate demonstration of best practice, without de ning what constitutes best practice or use policy approaches that give the option of “paying for pollution” or investing in clean technology. Frequently, the argument is made that there are reputational gains to being a first mover and putting the organization ahead of regulation, but the implication can be considerable upfront investment for uncertain returns. Against this context, this book provides a guide to the new world of environmental regulation for managers within business and students with a particular interest in understanding how environmental regulation works.","tags":["Business","Operations","Green Business Practices"]},{"id":"53863MIT56320","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Minding the Analytics Gap","authors":["Pamela Kirk Prentice","David Kiron","Sam Ransbotham"],"pages":"6","publication_date":"April 2015","description":"In an increasingly data-driven business environment, many executives must make critical decisionsbased on analyses that use data and statistical methods that they do not fully understand. How canexecutives with limited analytics expertise become adept consumers of analytics under such conditions?This question has become an important management issue as senior executives increasingly recognizethe importance of analytics to creating business value.The authors’ research — based on a survey of 2,719 managers in organizations from around theworld — found that the foremost barrier to creating business value from analytics is not data managementor complex modeling skills. Instead, the number one barrier mentioned by survey respondentsinvolved translating analytics into business actions — in other words, making business decisions basedon the results, not producing the results themselves. With more access to useful data, companies areincreasingly using sophisticated analytical methods. That, the authors argue, means there’s often a gapbetween an organization’s capacity to produce analytical results and its ability to apply them effectivelyto business issues.Much can be done to make analytics more consumable for managers. At the individual level, dataanalysts can learn more about the business; in fact, about a third (34%) of the survey respondentsreported that their organizations train analytics professionals to understand business issues. Organizations can also systemically improve infrastructure and processes; improved data quality, for example,can make it easier to turn data into competitive advantage.Managers can also take steps to become savvier at understanding analytical results. In fact, managersand executives are working to become more knowledgeable about data and analytics: Many of the surveyrespondents reported that their organizations develop analytical skills through on-the-job (58%) orformal (23%) training. Almost half the respondents (49%) reported that their organizations train managers to make better use of analytics. Beyond training, other known steps include: identifying trustworthy analytics professionals within the organization, requiring straightforward explanations and asking detailed questions.However, the authors’ research indicates that, despite their efforts, managers continue to find it difficultto keep pace with their organization’s analysts for two reasons: burgeoning analytics sophisticationand competing demands for managerial attention. What’s more, when an organization’s capacityto produce increasingly sophisticated analytics outpaces managers’ abilities to understand, discomfortis created — managers find they must make decisions based on complex analytical insights that theydo not yet fully understand. But, despite this discomfort, these managerial decisions must be made.The authors conclude by suggesting five ways that managers can increase their comfort in consuminganalytics.Reprint 56320.

As with any complex system, corporate governance functions best when all of its constituent elements work in harmony, when each performs its assigned role, with the right incentives, properly aligned interests, and the right tools for the job. The turbulent history of corporate governance in recent years is a testimony that this has not always been the case. A good number of the books written on corporate governance focus on legal issues—the rights and obligations of the various stakeholders under federal and state laws—or take the perspective of individual or institutional external shareholders. This book, with much updated material, is positioned differently; it approaches corporate governance from an executive perspective and is designed to help the reader become a more effective participant in the corporate governance system—as an executive dealing with a board, as a director, or as a representative of a company’s other numerous stakeholders.","tags":["Security","Governance, Risk Management and Compliance (GRC)","Governance"]},{"id":"9781637421109","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Developing Sustainable Energy Projects in Emerging Markets","authors":["Francis Ugboma"],"pages":"162","publication_date":"August 2021","description":"This book is an essential primer in the core principles of sustainable energy project development through concept, design, feasibility and reality and takes a holistic approach to the development and financing of such projects, setting out the technical, commercial and financial aspects in a straightforward and practical manner.

Much of the existing literature on family and corporate governance focuses on the larger and often publicly owned corporations instead of the unique and special issues of the much more prevalent privately held (usually smaller) family businesses. This book presents research-based information to provide the reader a deeper understanding of the complex nature of family owned businesses, their problems and challenges, and the unique governance structures and mechanisms that have been developed to properly guide a family business to greater effectiveness.\n\nFor the family, such structures include having family meetings, a family council, and a family constitution. For the business, the board of directors provides experienced and knowledgeable advice and recommendations, as well as oversight and monitoring activities. For the owners, a shareholder’s council and an annual shareholder meeting allows increased communication and voting on decisions. These family governance mechanisms have been shown to increase communication, reduce conflict, and improve decision making and professionalism. Each governance tool will be explored in depth. The audience for this book is family business owners, consultants, practitioners, and family business scholars.

In this rich, fascinating — surprisingly accessible — introduction, leading expert Eric Siegel reveals how predictive analytics works, and how it affects everyone every day. Rather than a “how to” for hands-on techies, the book serves lay readers and experts alike by covering new case studies and the latest state-of-the-art techniques.\n\nPrediction is booming. It reinvents industries and runs the world. Companies, governments, law enforcement, hospitals, and universities are seizing upon the power. These institutions predict whether you're going to click, buy, lie, or die. Why? For good reason: predicting human behavior combats risk, boosts sales, fortifies healthcare, streamlines manufacturing, conquers spam, optimizes social networks, toughens crime fighting, and wins elections. How? Prediction is powered by the world's most potent, flourishing unnatural resource: data. Accumulated in large part as the by-product of routine tasks, data is the unsalted, flavorless residue deposited en masse as organizations churn away. Surprise! This heap of refuse is a gold mine. Big data embodies an extraordinary wealth of experience from which to learn. Predictive Analytics unleashes the power of data. With this technology, the computer literally learns from data how to predict the future behavior of individuals. Perfect prediction is not possible, but putting odds on the future drives millions of decisions more effectively, determining whom to call, mail, investigate, incarcerate, set up on a date, or medicate. In this lucid, captivating introduction — now in its Revised and Updated edition — former Columbia University professor and Predictive Analytics World founder Eric Siegel reveals the power and perils of prediction:\n\nWhat type of mortgage risk Chase Bank predicted before the recession.\nPredicting which people will drop out of school, cancel a subscription, or get divorced before they even know it themselves.\nWhy early retirement predicts a shorter life expectancy and vegetarians miss fewer flights.\nFive reasons why organizations predict death — including one health insurance company.\nHow U.S. Bank and Obama for America calculated — and Hillary for America 2016 plans to calculate — the way to most strongly persuade each individual.\nWhy the NSA wants all your data: machine learning supercomputers to fight terrorism.\nHow IBM's Watson computer used predictive modeling to answer questions and beat the human champs on TV's Jeopardy!\nHow companies ascertain untold, private truths — how Target figures out you're pregnant and Hewlett-Packard deduces you're about to quit your job.\nHow judges and parole boards rely on crime-predicting computers to decide how long convicts remain in prison.\n182 examples from Airbnb, the BBC, Citibank, ConEd, Facebook, Ford, Google, the IRS, LinkedIn, Match.com, MTV, Netflix, PayPal, Pfizer, Spotify, Uber, UPS, Wikipedia, and more. \n\nHow does predictive analytics work?

Many portfolios are designed without any thought given to risk management before they are handed off to a dedicated—but separate—risk management team.\n\nIn Strategic Risk Management: Designing Portfolios and Managing Risk, Campbell R. Harvey, Sandy Rattray, and Otto Van Hemert deliver a reimagining of the risk management process. The book envisions a marriage between the investment and risk processes, an approach that has proven successful at the world’s largest publicly listed hedge fund, Man Group.\n\nThe authors provide readers with a new framework for portfolio design that includes defensive strategies, drawdown risk controls, volatility targeting, and actively timing rebalancing trades. You will learn about how the book’s new approach to risk management fared during the recent market drawdown at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. You will also discover why the traditional risk weighting approach only works on certain classes of assets.\n\nThe book shows you how to accurately evaluate the costs of defensive strategies and which ones offer the best and most cost-effective protection against market downturns. Finally, you will learn how to obtain a more balanced return stream by targeting volatility rather than a constant notional exposure and gain a deeper understanding of concepts like portfolio rebalancing.\n\nPerfect for people working in the asset management industry and financial policy makers, Strategic Risk Management: Designing Portfolios and Managing Risk will also earn a place in the libraries of economics and finance scholars, as well as casual readers who take an active approach to investing in their savings or pension assets.\n\nPRAISE FOR STRATEGIC RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n“Strategic Risk Management shows how to fully embed risk management into the portfolio management process as an equal partner to alpha. This should clearly be best practice for all asset managers.”—Jase Auby, Chief Investment Officer, the Teacher Retirement System of Texas\n\n“This book shows the power of integrating risk and investment management, rather than applying risk management as an afterthought to satisfy set limits. I was pleased to shepherd some of the key ideas in this book through the publication process at The Journal of Portfolio Management.”—Frank J. Fabozzi, Editor, The Journal of Portfolio Management\n\n“Financial markets today are quite different from those of the last century. Understanding leverage, correlations, tails, and other risk parameters of a portfolio is at least as important as work on signals and alpha. In that sense, bringing risk management from ‘control’ to ‘front office’ should be a priority for asset managers. This book explains how to do it.”—Marko Kolanovic, Chief Global Market Strategist, J.P. Morgan\n\nA powerful new approach to risk management in volatile and uncertain markets\n\nWhile the COVID-19 pandemic threw the importance of effective risk management into sharp relief, many investment firms hang on to a traditional and outdated model of risk management. Using siloed and independent portfolio management and risk monitoring teams, these firms miss out on the opportunities presented by integrated risk management.\n\nStrategic Risk Management: Designing Portfolios and Managing Risk delivers a fresh approach to risk management in difficult market conditions. The accomplished author team advocates for the amalgamation of portfolio design and risk monitoring teams, incorporating risk management into every aspect of portfolio design.\n\nThe book provides a roadmap for the cr","tags":["Security","Governance, Risk Management and Compliance (GRC)","Operational Risk"]},{"id":"9781592539277","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Design Elements, 2nd Edition","authors":["Timothy Samara"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"April 2014","description":"This updated version of Rockport’s bestselling Design Elements offers expanded and updated content in a new, cleaner format for easier navigation.

To do all that, clearly the data must be accurate and organized so it is accessible and understandable to all who need it.\n\nThat task has grown in importance as the volume of enterprise data has been growing significantly (analyst estimates of 40 - 50% growth per year are not uncommon) over the years. However, most of that data has been what we call \"structured\" data, which is the type that can fit neatly into rows and columns and be more easily analyzed. Now we are in the era of \"big data.\" This significantly increases the volume of data available, but it is in a form called \"unstructured\" data. That is, data from sources that are not as easily organized, such as data from emails, spreadsheets, sensors, video, audio, and social media sites. There is valuable information in all that data but it calls for new processes to enable it to be analyzed.\n\nAll this has brought with it a renewed and critical need to manage and organize that data with clarity of meaning, understandability, and interoperability. That is, you must be able to integrate this data when it is from within an enterprise but also importantly when it is from many different external sources.\n\nWhat is described here has been and is being done to varying extents. It is called \"information governance.\" Governing this information however has proven to be challenging. But without governance, much of the data can be less useful and perhaps even used incorrectly, significantly impacting enterprise decision making. So we must also respect the needs for information security, consistency, and validity or else suffer the potential economic and legal consequences. Implementing sound governance practices needs to be an integral part of the information control in our organizations.\n\nThis IBM® Redbooks® publication focuses on the building blocks of a solid governance program. It examines some familiar governance initiative scenarios, identifying how they underpin key governance initiatives, such as Master Data Management, Quality Management, Security and Privacy, and Information Lifecycle Management. IBM Information Management and Governance solutions provide a comprehensive suite to help organizations better understand and build their governance solutions. The book also identifies new and innovative approaches that are developed by IBM practice leaders that can help as you implement the foundation capabilities in your organizations.","tags":["Security","Governance, Risk Management and Compliance (GRC)","Governance"]},{"id":"9781491947272","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Gradle Recipes for Android","authors":["Ken Kousen"],"pages":"166","publication_date":"June 2016","description":"Android adopted Gradle as the preferred build automation system a few years ago, but many Android developers are still unfamiliar with this open source tool.

The Digital Zone System (DZS) is an innovative methodology for editing digital images that mimics the Zone System created by Adams. With this book, author Robert Fisher presents a practical guide for editing digital images with a level of control previously unattainable without significant manual work. He walks the reader through the background of Adam's original Zone System and points out similarities to current digital processes including Expose to the Right (ETTR) and high dynamic range imaging (HDRI). Learn to use luminance masks to separate an image into \"one-stop\" zones of brightness, similar to the zones in Adams's Zone System, that can be worked on individually or in groups. This makes the DZS a powerful tool for converting color images to black and white. You will also gain tremendous control over how color is adjusted in your images by learning to isolate and adjust color in specific targeted areas. These DZS processes are quicker and simpler than the tedious work of using global adjustments and painting in layer masks to isolate the effects of an adjustment layer.In this book, you will learn how to use the Digital Zone System for editing color images, converting images to black and white, and tone mapping HDR images. Also included are brief discussions of color management, setting up Photoshop, printing, and exposure for digital images. The book is richly illustrated with step-by-step screenshots and stunning example images that show the benefits of the Digital Zone System over commonly used digital editing methods. Once mastered, the DZS will allow you to produce a higher level of quality in your images, at a faster pace and with greater ease than ever before.","tags":["Software Development","Graphics Programming","Digital Image Processing"]},{"id":"9781119044963","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Becoming a Graphic and Digital Designer: A Guide to Careers in Design, 5th Edition","authors":["Steven Heller","Veronique Vienne"],"pages":"336","publication_date":"April 2015","description":"Begin your graphic design career now, with the guidance of industry experts\n\nBecoming a Graphic and Digital Designer is a single source guide to the myriad of options available to those pursuing a graphic design career.

Whether that complexity is harnessed to build a world that is safe, pleasant, humane and profitable, or whether it causes us to careen off a cliff into an abyss of mind-numbing junk is an open question. The challenges and opportunities--technical, business, and human--that this technological sea change will bring are without precedent. Entire industries will be born and others will be laid to ruin as our society navigates this journey.\n\nThere are already many more computing devices in the world than there are people. In a few more years, their number will climb into the trillions. We put microprocessors into nearly every significant thing that we manufacture, and the cost of routine computing and storage is rapidly becoming negligible. We have literally permeated our world with computation. But more significant than mere numbers is the fact we are quickly figuring out how to make those processors communicate with each other, and with us. We are about to be faced, not with a trillion isolated devices, but with a trillion-node network: a network whose scale and complexity will dwarf that of today's Internet. And, unlike the Internet, this will be a network not of computation that we use, but of computation that we live in.\n\nWritten by the leaders of one of America's leading pervasive computing design firms, this book gives a no-holds-barred insiders' account of both the promise and the risks of the age of Trillions. It is also a cautionary tale of the head-in-the-sand attitude with which many of today's thought-leaders are at present approaching these issues.

This brand-new package brings together three practical, state-of-the-art primers for doing just that. Robert Palevich’s The Lean Sustainable Supply Chain offers start-to-finish guidance for redesigning company infrastructure and technologies to achieve the powerful benefits that come with integrating \"lean\" and \"green.\" and benefits. Palevich introduces core concepts of lean green supply chain management, illuminating them with a comprehensive case study showing how to manage change, innovation, talent, execution, inventory, warehousing, and transportation. He demonstrates how to integrate supply chain sustainability into business scorecards; use 3PLs more effectively; drive more value from information, and systematically address every relevant technical issue. Next, in Creating a Sustainable Organization, Peter A. Soyka presents today’s most complete and actionable guide to improving business performance through sustainable practices. Soyka bridges the disparate worlds of the EHS/sustainability professional and the investor/analyst, outlining today’s best evidence about linkages between sustainability and value, discussing key stakeholder relationships, and introducing new practices for managing and measuring sustainability throughout the business.

Pettit","Keely L. Croxton","Mikaella Polyviou"],"pages":"8","publication_date":"January 2015","description":"Globalization has made anticipating disruptions and managing them when they occur more challenging. Although companies originally moved production offshore to countries such as India and China to take advantage of lower labor costs, events such as Iceland’s 2010 volcanic eruption and the Japanese tsunami in 2011 have shown that the vulnerabilities of extended supply chains are real and serious.\n\nLean supply-chain practices, designed to keep costs low in a stable business environment, can increase risk levels during disruptions due to the lack of buffer capacity. While companies tend to focus on the supply side of their supply chains when scanning for potential risk factors, they also need to pay attention to the customer side.\n\nApproaches to risk management such as enterprise risk management (ERM) and business continuity management (BCM) can help companies avoid supply-chain disruptions and recover normal operations quickly. But in the authors’ view, they rely too heavily on risk identification when many of the risks are unpredictable or unknowable before the fact. They also depend on statistical information that may not exist and address each risk independently. Finally, they are predicated on the goal of returning to a stable operating condition.\n\nBased on their work with a number of companies, including fashion retailer L Brands Inc. (formerly known as Limited Brands), Dow Chemical, Johnson & Johnson and Unilever, the authors present a comprehensive framework for assessing supply-chain vulnerabilities and addressing them through enhanced resilience capabilities. The framework, which they call Supply Chain Resilience Assessment and Management (SCRAM), is based on an explicit characterization and prioritization of the vulnerabilities that make an organization susceptible to disruptions, and the capabilities that help an organization anticipate and overcome disruptions. The framework is designed to help companies identify their most important supply-chain vulnerabilities and to set priorities for capabilities that need to be strengthened.","tags":["Security","Governance, Risk Management and Compliance (GRC)","Operational Risk"]},{"id":"9780240813356","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Exploring Color Photography Fifth Edition, 5th Edition","authors":["Robert Hirsch"],"pages":"358","publication_date":"February 2013","description":"The classic book on color photography is back in print and completely revamped for a digital photography audience!\n\nLearn from step-by-step instruction, illustrative charts, and unbelievably inspirational imagery in this guide meant just for color photographers.

Events from the collapse of Lehman Brothers to the Greek sovereign debt crisis demonstrate the urgent and abiding need for statistical tools adequate to measure and anticipate the amplitude of potential swings in the financial market's from ordinary stock price and interest rate moves, to defaults, to those increasingly frequent \"rare events\" fashionably called black swan events. Yet many on Wall Street continue to rely on standard models based on artificially simplified assumptions that can lead to systematic (and sometimes catastrophic) underestimation of real risks.\n\nIn Practical Methods of Financial Engineering and Risk Management, Dr. Rupak Chatterjee former director of the multi-asset quantitative research group at Citiintroduces finance professionals and advanced students to the latest concepts, tools, valuation techniques, and analytic measures being deployed by the more discerning and responsive Wall Street practitioners, on all operational scales from day trading to institutional strategy, to model and analyze more faithfully the real behavior and risk exposure of financial markets in the cold light of the post-2008 realities. Until one masters this modern skill set, one cannot allocate risk capital properly, price and hedge derivative securities realistically, or risk-manage positions from the multiple perspectives of market risk, credit risk, counterparty risk, and systemic risk.\n\nThe book assumes a working knowledge of calculus, statistics, and Excel, but it teaches techniques from statistical analysis, probability, and stochastic processes sufficient to enable the reader to calibrate probability distributions and create the simulations that are used on Wall Street to valuate various financial instruments correctly, model the risk dimensions of trading strategies, and perform the numerically intensive analysis of risk measures required by various regulatory agencies.","tags":["Security","Governance, Risk Management and Compliance (GRC)","Operational Risk"]},{"id":"9781592537792","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Graphic Design and Architecture, A 20th Century History","authors":["Richard Poulin"],"pages":"1","publication_date":"November 2012","description":"This innovative volume is the first to provide the design student, practitioner, and educator with an invaluable comprehensive reference of visual and narrative material that illustrates and evaluates the unique and important history surrounding graphic design and architecture.

Considerable emphasis is also given to the key controls and the importance of control functions, audit and risk management groups and policy. Case studies are used to effectively demonstrate 'success' and 'failure'. In the financial services industry risk is a constant threat to organizations of all sizes and to the markets themselves. Many industry 'events' have shown how dangerous it is when a business operates in an uncontrolled way, particularly when the lack of control was not evident to the management of the business until it was too late.Controls, procedures and risk are occupying more and more management time. The responsibility to manage the risks lies with the whole operations team. If it is successful in fulfilling this role the overall risk of the business is reduced, if it is not successful the consequences may be severe.In this book the author has deliberately focussed on the practical side of risk, controls and procedures, rather than analyse the Basel Capital Accord and the capital requirements etc.(however, the Accord and updates are contained in the Appendices). Operations teams need to be aware of risk but not overwhelmed by it. Risk management within, and by, the operations function is the focus of this book.

Easy to read, comprehensive, pragmatic...excellent job.”\n\n--Nick Laqua, Enterprise SOA Architect, Cathay Pacific Airways\n\n“SOA Governance is a must-read that provides an in-depth look at the organizational, managerial, procedural, and technical aspects that any SOA project needs to consider. If you’re investing in SOA, you’ll benefit greatly by having this excellent resource available to you as you contend with the many challenges of creating your own SOA governance.”\n\n--David E. Michalowicz, Principal, Information Systems Engineer, The MITRE Corporation\n\n“With this book Thomas Erl [and his team] do a great job in outlining a framework to implement an SOA governance program. For each stage of the project lifecycle, necessary governance precepts and processes are described concretely by referring to the service-orientation principles and SOA patterns. This makes it an indispensable source of information for any SOA practitioner or any professional who plans to start an SOA initiative.”\n\n--Jean-Paul De Baets, Principal SOA Architect, Fedict (Belgian Federal Government Information and Communication Technology Service)\n\n“This book on SOA governance provides both thoughtful and carefully crafted narrative and the supplementation of poignant real-world case studies that will help practitioners calibrate guidance to realities on the ground. This is a terrific book that will be heavily used--with tab stickers, dog-ears, highlighting, and column notes abounding to show for it--as practitioners strategize and subsequently iterate through organizational learnings on their journeys to SOA maturity.”\n\n--David S. Rogers, Manager, IEEE Conferences Business and Technology Solutions Office\n\n“Thomas Erl’s SOA Governance clarifies the principles behind this crucial capability for SOA adoption. Finally, a contribution that serves as a guide for project managers, architects, and any related role that has a common goal: the establishment, administration, and vision behind a service-enabled enterprise. Accenture sees this book as a milestone that will support the rationale behind selling and delivering SOA governance projects around the world.”\n\n--Dr. Matthias Ziegler, Accenture; Dr. Jure Zakotnik, Accenture; Thomas M. Michelbach, Accenture\n\n“Thomas Erl’s SOA Governance book fills in an important missing piece for any organization wanting to move to--and succeed with--an enterprise commitment to implement SOA and realize its overarching benefits. Of equal importance, however, is the fact that the basic concepts and frameworks that the book instantiates in the context of SOA can also be productively applied in other contexts that are not formally ‘SOA-esque,’ but where complexity is in need of formal governance.”\n\n--Charles N.

Groovy has much in common with popular scripting languages such as Perl, Python, and Ruby, but is written in a Java-like syntax. And, unlike these other languages, Groovy is sanctioned by the Java community for use on the Java platform. Since it is based on Java, applications written in Groovy can make full use of the Java Application Programmer Interfaces (APIs). This means Groovy can integrate seamlessly with applications written in Java, while avoiding the complexities of the full Java language. This bare-bones structure also means Groovy can be used as an introduction to Java and to programming in general. Its simpler constructions and modern origins make it ideal as a first language and for introducing principles such as object-oriented programming.This book introduces all the major aspects of Groovy development and emphasizes Groovy's potential as a learning tool. Case studies and exercises are included, along with numerous programming examples.

How should we think about firms sacrificing profits in the social interest? Are they permitted to do so, given their fiduciary responsibilities to their shareholders? Even if permissible, is the practice sustainable, or will the competitive marketplace render such efforts and their impacts transient at best? Furthermore, is the practice, however well intended, an efficient use of social and economic resources? And, as an empirical matter, to what extent do firms already behave this way?

An objective study intended for a diverse readership, Corporate Governance Regulation unveils the underlying, root causes of regulatory failure. The result: A compelling and original analysis, broadly suited for a global audience of all backgrounds.\n\nWritten by published, subject-area experts, the authors carefully delineate how U.S. corporate governance regulation, beginning with Sarbanes Oxley, lacks an adequate rational basis, as may be attributed to a non-existent policy dialogue\n\nThe witnessed result: A conspicuous lack of regulatory efficacy, enormous costs, coupled with paltry benefits\n\nThe focus is upon reigniting a stalled, non-productive policy dialogue, by eschewing stale, overly-polemicized arguments, as needed to develop a common ground\n\nDrawing from an eclectic, analytic framework, governance experts Nicholas Vakkur and Zulma Herrera offer both the professional and global citizen alike a multi-dimensional understanding of issues critical to global economic health.

'Managing Operational Risk in Financial Markets' outlines the major issues for risk management and focuses on operational risk as a key activity in managing risk on an enterprise-wide basis. While risk management had always been an integral part of financial activity, the 1990s has seen the requirement for risk management establish itself as a key function within banks and other financial institutions. With greater emphasis on ensuring that money is not lost through adverse market conditions, counterparty failure or inappropriate controls, systems or people, risk management has become a discipline in its own right. Managing risk is now THE paramount topic within the financial sector. Recurring major losses through the 1990s has shocked financial institutions into placing much greater emphasis on risk management and controls. The collapse of Barings and losses made by Metallgescellschaft, Orange County, Diawa and Sumitomo as a result of a lack of procedures, systems or managerial control has demonstrated to organisations the need to broaden the scope of their risk management activity from merely looking at market and credit risk. This has brought into focus the need for managing operational risk. Operational risk can only be managed on an enterprise wide basis as it includes the entire process of policies, culture, procedures, expertise and systems that an institution needs in order to manage all the risks resulting from its financial transactions. In fact, in order to effectively manage market and credit risks it is necessary to have the relevant skills and expertise in the staff, technical and organisational infrastructure, as well as monitoring and control systems. As all of these are components of operational risk, it then becomes apparent that an integrated risk management approach needs to focus on operational risk.Provides a comprehensive framework for the management of operational riskDefines the spectrum of risks faced by organisations and how they can effectively manage theseDevelops an enterprise-wide risk information system and defines the major challenges that need to be addressed in developing such a system","tags":["Security","Governance, Risk Management and Compliance (GRC)","Operational Risk"]},{"id":"0642572059255","language":"en","level":"Intermediate","title":"Use ChatGPT to Create a Weather App","authors":["Tom Taulli"],"publication_date":"June 2024","description":"Whether you're a developer, a creative writer, or business manager, these shortcuts will help you get the most from ChatGPT.

Yet many risk managers do not have a clear understanding of the basics. Requiring no statistical or mathematical background, The Fundamental Rules of Risk Management gives you the knowledge to successfully handle risk in your organization.\n\nThe book begins with a deep investigation into the behavioral roots of risk. Using both historical and contemporary contexts, author Nigel Da Costa Lewis carefully details the indisputable truths surrounding many of the behavioral biases that induce risk. He exposes the fallacy of the wisdom of experts, explains why you cannot rely on regulators, outlines the characteristics of the \"glad game,\" and demonstrates how high intelligence or lack thereof can lead to loss of hard-earned wealth. He also discusses the weaknesses and failures of modern risk management.\n\nMoving on to elements often overlooked by risk managers, Dr. Lewis traces the link between corporate governance and risk management. He then covers core lessons surrounding the role of risk managers as well as the difficult subject of integrated, single lens analysis of risk. The book also explores aspects of spreadsheet risk and draws on lessons learned in the information systems and software engineering communities to provide guidance on selecting the right risk management system. It concludes with a discussion on the most dominant of risk measures—value at risk.\n\nHaving a clear understanding about risk separates successful professionals, companies, and economies from history’s forgotten failures.

Safety experts emphasize the cautionary principle, stating that in the face of uncertainty, caution should be the dominant standard. On the other hand, relying on economic assessment often leads to decisions made using expected values to optimize return on investment. Safety Risk Management: Integrating Economic and Safety Perspectives aims to illuminate this dichotomy while debating important questions. For example, is ‘safety always first?’ Additionally, in many risk environments only partial knowledge is available and limited emphasis may be mistakenly given to uncertainty.\n\nRisk management deals with balancing the dilemma inherent in exploring opportunities on the one hand, and avoiding losses, accidents, and disasters, on the other. Safety Risk Management: Integrating Economic and Safety Perspectives comprises a collection of work in this field with special focus given to situations with the potential for substantial reward but also with the possibility of immense losses and extreme consequences.\n\nThis book aims to contribute to clarifying the problem by proposing an appropriate basis for managing risk to meet related practical challenges.

It then moves on to examine the range of risks, risk controls, and risk management strategies currently employed by practitioners, and focuses on particular risks embedded in the more classic investment strategies such as Long/Short, Convertible Arbitrage, Fixed Income Arbitrage, Short selling and risk arbitrage. Addressed along side these are other risks common to hedge funds, including liquidity risk, leverage risk and counterparty risk.\n\nThe book then moves on to examine more closely two models which provide the underpinning for market risk management in investment today - Style Value-at-Risk and Implicit Value-at-Risk.

Academic books are typically concerned primarily with measurement techniques, and devote only a small section to describing the applications, usually without discussing the problems that changing organizational processes in banks may have on business units¡¦ behaviour. Practitioners¡¦ books are often based on a single experience, presenting the approach that has been pursued by a single bank, but often do not adequately evaluate that approach. In actual practice, the choice of how to use Value at Risk and risk-adjusted performance measures has no single optimal solution, but requires effective decision making that can identify the solution that is consistent with the bank¡¦s style of management and coordination mechanisms, and often with characteristics of individual business units as well. In this book, Francesco Saita of Bocconi University argues that even though risk measurement techniques have greatly improved in recent years for market, credit and now also operational risk, capital management and capital allocation decisions are far from becoming purely technical and mechanical. On one hand, decisions about capital management must consider handling different capital constraints (e.g. regulatory vs. economic capital ) and face remarkable difficulties in providing a measure of ¡§aggregated¡¨ Value at Risk (i.e. a measure that considers the overall value at risk of the bank after diversification across risk types). On the other hand, the aim of using capital more efficiently through capital allocation cannot be achieved only through a sort of centralized asset allocation process, but rather by designing a Value at Risk limit system and a risk-adjusted performance measurement system that are designed to provide the right incentives to individual business units.

All the partners in the process—photographers, designers, and printers—had clearly defined roles and responsibilities. With the introduction of Adobe Photoshop in 1990, the digital imaging revolution changed all that. Roles suddenly shifted and blurred. Standards disintegrated. The entire process quickly spiraled into a chaotic free-for-all that couldn’t help but leave everyone frustrated as they scratched their heads and wondered, “What’s wrong with my color?” CMYK 2.0: A Cooperative Workflow for Photographers, Designers, and Printers has one purpose: to get us all back on the same path to creating predictable color in the RGB-to-CMYK workflow. In a field that often features very strong—and very different—opinions, author Rick McCleary emphasizes the need for cooperation, collaboration, and communication. After first establishing a context for how we all got here, McCleary redefines each partner’s role in the process, demystifies the entire RGB-to-CMYK workflow, and offers a clear, step-by-step guide to achieving predictable color on press. Written with exceptional clarity, CMYK 2.0 presents a highly detailed and thoroughly rigorous approach to CMYK color, and it offers a workflow that all photographers, designers, and printers need—one that works. The book's companion website provides a collaborative forum of growing resources and information on all things CMYK.","tags":["Design","Visual Design","Graphic Design","Color"]},{"id":"9780814437223","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Managing Government Employees","authors":["Stewart Liff"],"pages":"224","publication_date":"February 2007","description":"Managing government employees presents unique challenges.

Bell","David Fogarty"],"pages":"5","publication_date":"January 2014","description":"The surge of interest in big data has led to growing demand for analytics teams. Assembling such teams, however, is difficult. For one thing, many companies lack the in-house knowledge and experience needed to put together a world-class analytics team. What’s more, the labor market for analytics professionals has grown increasingly tight. The shortage of analysts — particularly those capable of developing and leading world-class teams that can enable a company to create a competitive advantage from its data and analytics — is driving organizations to consider outsourcing their analytics activities. Analytics is the latest in a string of activities companies are outsourcing to business process organizations (BPOs). It draws heavily on mathematics and statistics knowledge, and many analytics-oriented BPOs have operations in India. Although some companies have world-class analytics capabilities in-house, the authors posed the question: Can an analytically naïve company “buy” world-class analytics functions by hiring outside experts? The authors studied both four multinational companies that used one or more offshore analytics BPOs and four analytics BPOs. Two of the client companies had skills that were judged to be “analytically superior”; the other two were judged to be “analytically challenged.” The analytically challenged companies saw analytics BPOs as a way to obtain the resources and training needed to manage and execute their analytics and to gain quick access to important insights. By contrast, the analytically superior companies wanted to expand their internal analytic capabilities, in part because they wanted to preserve their ability to develop and protect intellectual property; they tended to use offshore BPOs to perform low-level analytics. According to the authors, the best analytics BPOs have core competencies that go beyond what most companies can perform on their own with internal teams. They advise companies working with analytics BPOs to be clear about who does what, who owns what, how each party can use the information it has and what happens to the information and knowledge in the event that the BPO is acquired.","tags":["Data","Data Science","Web Analytics","Google Analytics"]},{"id":"9781637420072","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Business Sustainability Factors of Performance, Risk, and Disclosure","authors":["Dr. Zabihollah Rezaee"],"pages":"130","publication_date":"March 2021","description":"Business Sustainability Factors of Performance, Risk, and Disclosure examines sustainability factors of performance, risk and disclosure.

Drawing on research conducted in collaboration with the French Institute for Radiological Protection and Nuclear Safety (IRSN), the ideas that are put forward rely on a review of the practices of specialists in human and organizational factors concerning nuclear safety. The author shows that the French approach depends on maintaining a technical dialogue between the regulatory authority (ASN), IRSN and nuclear operators. This method of risk management is known as \"French cooking\" in the Anglo-Saxon world, where a more formal regulatory approach is taken. This technical dialogue does however hold certain benefits, particularly in the field of human and organizational factors, where it allows an advancement of the state of knowledge, which remains incomplete. After the Fukushima accident, in the face of an ongoing European and global re-evaluation of the safety of nuclear power and alignment towards the Anglo-Saxon standard, the French cooking approach may yet be able to make a significant contribution. This work will be of interest to all involved in nuclear power engineering and in the field of risk management and nuclear safety.\n\nIncludes a preface by Jacques Repussard, Director General, IRSN, France, and a postface by Erik Hollnagel, Professor, Institute of Regional Health Research, University of Southern Denmark / Chief Consultant, Centre for Quality, Region of Southern Denmark.","tags":["Security","Governance, Risk Management and Compliance (GRC)","Operational Risk"]},{"id":"9781592534463","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Best of Brochure Design 10","authors":["Perry Chua"],"pages":"224","publication_date":"December 2008","description":"The best-selling series continues!

An eBook of this older edition is included at no additional cost when you buy the revised edition!\n\nThe Web is experiencing a new growth with an emphasis on rich, web-based applications. These applications can be difficult to build because they rely on JavaScript, which lacks the sophisticated object-oriented structures and static typing of Java, they are tricky to debug, and they require you to manage numerous browser inconsistencies.\n\nThe Google Web Toolkit (GWT) is a new technology from Google that automatically translates Java into JavaScript, making Ajax applications easier to code and deploy. GWT in Action is a comprehensive tutorial for Java developers interested in building the next generation of rich, web-based applications. This book was written by Robert Hanson, creator of the popular GWT Widget Library, and Adam Tacy, a major contributor to the GWT Widget Library.\n\nAbout the Technology\n\nIn May of 2006 Google released the Google Web Toolkit. GWT enables developers to create Ajax applications in Java. With GWT, you can build your applications using a real object-oriented language and take advantage of Java tools like Eclipse that are already available. Instead of trying to bring tool support to Ajax, Google brought Ajax to a place where the tools already existed.\n\nAbout the Book\n\nGWT in Action shows you how to take advantage of these exciting new tools. This clearly-written book is packed with hands-on GWT examples. You'll absorb the GWT philosophy as you build your first working GWT application.\n\nThe book begins by exploring the main features of GWT, including\n\nCompiling Java to JavaScript, the magic that really defines GWT\nBuilding client-side components\nConvenient JUnit integration and testing\nInteracting with JavaScript and existing JavaScript libraries\nInternationalization\n\nYou'll also see how GWT compares to other toolkits.\n\nGWT in Action shows you how to set up your development environment, use and create widgets, communicate with the server, and much more. Readers will follow an example running throughout the book and quickly master the basics of GWT: widgets, panels, and event handling. The book covers the full development cycle, from setting up your development environment, to building the application, then deploying it to the web server. The entire core GWT library is discussed, with details and examples on how it can be extended.\n\nYou'll cover:\n\nTesting, debugging, and deploying GWT Applications\nCommunicating with GWT-RPC\nExamining client-side RPC architecture\nAlternative RPC tools: HTTPRequest, RequestBuilder, and FormPanel\nAchieving interoperability in GWT with JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)\nMaking your GWT application flexible and supportable\n\nGWT helps you make the most of Ajax in your web applications and GWT in Action helps you get more out of GWT.\n\nWhat's Inside\nComprehensive GWT tutorial\nBuild a full-scale GWT application\nInteracting with the server using GWT-RPC, JSON, and other tools\nBuilding, testing, and deploying GWT applications\nAbout the ReaderAbout the Authors\n\nRobert Hanson is a US-based senior Internet engineer and creator of the popular open source GWT Widget Library.

There is, however, space for another such framework that integrates seamlessly with Java. Thousands of companies have invested in Java, and these same companies are losing out on the benefits of a Rails–like framework. Enter Grails.\n\nGrails is not just a Rails clone. It aims to provide a Rails–like environment that is more familiar to Java developers and employs idioms that Java developers are comfortable using, making the adjustment in mentality to a dynamic framework less of a jump. The concepts within Grails, like interceptors, tag libs, and Groovy Server Pages (GSP), make those in the Java community feel right at home.\n\nGrails' foundation is on solid open source technologies such as Spring, Hibernate, and SiteMesh, which gives it even more potential in the Java space: Spring provides powerful inversion of control and MVC, Hibernate brings a stable, mature object relational mapping technology with the ability to integrate with legacy systems, and SiteMesh handles flexible layout control and page decoration.\n\nGrails complements these with additional features that take advantage of the coding–by–convention paradigm such as dynamic tag libraries, Grails object relational mapping, Groovy Server Pages, and scaffolding.\n\nGraeme Rocher, Grails lead and founder, and Jeff Brown bring you completely up–to–date with their authoritative and fully comprehensive guide to the Grails framework. You'll get to know all the core features, services, and Grails extensions via plug–ins, and understand the roles that Groovy and Grails are playing in the changing Web.\n\nWhat you'll learn\n\nDiscover how the Web is changing and the role the Groovy language and its Rails framework play\n\nGet to know the Grails Project and its domains, services, filters, controllers, views, testing, and plug–ins\n\nExperience the availability of plug–ins for Rich Client and Ajax, web services, performance/utilities, scheduling, security, functionality, and even Persistence\n\nSee how Grails works with other frameworks like Spring, Wicket, Hibernate, and more\n\nCreate custom plug–ins in Grails\n\nWho this book is for\n\nThis book is for everyone who is looking for a more agile approach to web development with a dynamic scripting language such as Groovy. This includes a large number of Java developers who have been enticed by the productivity gains seen with frameworks such as Ruby on Rails, JRuby on Rails, etc. The Web and its environment is a perfect fit for easily adaptable and concise languages such as Groovy and Ruby, and there is huge interest from the developer community in general to embrace these languages.","tags":["Software Development","Programming Languages","JVM Languages","Groovy","Grails"]},{"id":"9780321553133","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Adobe Type Library Reference Book, Third Edition","authors":["Adobe Systems, Inc."],"pages":"368","publication_date":"December 2007","description":"Choosing the right font can be one of the hardest parts of your job as a digital designer—there are literally thousands to choose from.

The data is becoming too big to manage and use with traditional tools. The solution: implementing a big data system.\n\nAs Big Data Made Easy: A Working Guide to the Complete Hadoop Toolset shows, Apache Hadoop offers a scalable, fault-tolerant system for storing and processing data in parallel. It has a very rich toolset that allows for storage (Hadoop), configuration (YARN and ZooKeeper), collection (Nutch and Solr), processing (Storm, Pig, and Map Reduce), scheduling (Oozie), moving (Sqoop and Avro), monitoring (Chukwa, Ambari, and Hue), testing (Big Top), and analysis (Hive).\n\nThe problem is that the Internet offers IT pros wading into big data many versions of the truth and some outright falsehoods born of ignorance. What is needed is a book just like this one: a wide-ranging but easily understood set of instructions to explain where to get Hadoop tools, what they can do, how to install them, how to configure them, how to integrate them, and how to use them successfully. And you need an expert who has worked in this area for a decade—someone just like author and big data expert Mike Frampton.\n\nBig Data Made Easy approaches the problem of managing massive data sets from a systems perspective, and it explains the roles for each project (like architect and tester, for example) and shows how the Hadoop toolset can be used at each system stage. It explains, in an easily understood manner and through numerous examples, how to use each tool. The book also explains the sliding scale of tools available depending upon data size and when and how to use them. Big Data Made Easy shows developers and architects, as well as testers and project managers, how to:\n\nStore big data\nConfigure big data\nProcess big data\nSchedule processes\nMove data among SQL and NoSQL systems\nMonitor data\nPerform big data analytics\nReport on big data processes and projects\nTest big data systems\n\nBig Data Made Easy also explains the best part, which is that this toolset is free. Anyone can download it and—with the help of this book—start to use it within a day.

Over the past 25 years, Value at Risk (VaR) became the common universal standard in risk measurement. However, the financial crisis of 2007/2009 clearly demonstrated great discrepancies in risk estimates based on this indicator. In this report, three of the field’s leading experts objectively consider each key criticism of VaR in recent professional literature, including VaR’s underestimation of the magnitude and frequency of extreme outcomes, the difficulty of obtaining reliable VaR estimates for complex portfolios, the limited value of historical data, imperfections in the effective market hypothesis that underlies VaR, and several more. Next, the authors carefully review refinements and alternatives that have been proposed as potential replacements or complements, including Conditional VaR (Expected Shortfall), Shock VaR, modifications in the handling of parameters uncertainty, liquidity adjustment, higher moments, and more. They conclude by discussing why a sound risk management system continues to require deep understanding of complex adaptive and often irrational market mechanisms and still cannot be reduced to a mere combination of indicators, no matter how sophisticated they are.","tags":["Security","Governance, Risk Management and Compliance (GRC)","Operational Risk"]},{"id":"9780081008003","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Green Composites, 2nd Edition","authors":["Caroline Baillie","Randika Jayasinghe"],"pages":"220","publication_date":"January 2017","description":"Green Composites: Waste-based Materials for a Sustainable Future, Second Edition presents exciting new developments on waste-based composites.

This book takes a cool look at the subject and shows you what makes it relevant to your business. A big part of the answer is energy. Computers consume a lot of energy, and energy costs money. The cost of powering and cooling data servers over three years is currently 1.5 times the cost of purchasing the server hardware. Over the next two decades, global demand for energy is predicted to rise by 50%, which means that your long-term energy costs are also likely to increase. In the end, if your organisation's energy costs are high, it makes sense for you to focus on ways to reduce energy consumption. Improving the efficiency of data centre power supplies and reducing IT power requirements in the office are examples of how Green IT can yield a substantial return on investment.\n\nThis business guide to Green IT was written to introduce, to a business audience, the opposing groups and the key climate change concepts, to provide an overview of a Green IT strategy and to set out a straightforward, bottom-line orientated Green IT action plan.\n\nBenefits to business of a Green IT strategy:\n\nCut costs A Green IT strategy, including such measures as switching off PCs at night, or introducing Cloud Computing, will enable you to reduce the amount of energy that your organisation consumes and, therefore, to cut costs.\nImprove sales Products that can demonstrate their green credentials are more attractive to consumers. As organisations pursue more ambitious environmental objectives, they are putting their suppliers under increasing pressure to improve their own environmental record. Meanwhile, the public sector has adopted rigorous standards for Green procurement. With Green IT you can help your company to reach more customers and to win new business.\nEnhance your organisation's reputation The environment is an emotional issue, and environmental concerns affect the way your company is perceived by consumers. Green IT will support your company's Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) strategy by reducing the environmental impact of your operations. The evidence suggests that the market rewards companies whose practices are environmentally responsible.\nConform to regulations and standards New regulations, such as the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directive, aim to reduce the effects on the environment resulting from the use and disposal of IT equipment. Such regulations apply in many different countries, so compliance will help your business to operate at an international level.\n\nGreen social responsibility\n\nConsumers have a more positive view of a company that takes its corporate social responsibility seriously, and addressing environmental concerns is now an important component of any organisation's CSR. In the UK, the Companies Act 2006 introduced a statutory requirement for public companies to report on social and environmental matters. Thanks to the growing interest in ethical investment, CSR is also becoming a higher priority in terms of investor relations. All organisations in the developed world now use information technology. They should, therefore, plan to reduce the environmental impacts of their IT use within the framework of their overall CSR policy.\n\nThis book offers a practical, balanced assessment, which will enable company directors and executives to appreciate the business benefits of a Green IT strategy.\n\nBuy this book to find out how a Green IT strategy can benefit your bottom line!","tags":["Business","Operations","Green Business Practices"]},{"id":"9781466503182","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Green Products","authors":["Joao Neiva de Figueiredo","Mauro F Guillen"],"pages":"226","publication_date":"July 2011","description":"Sharing successful examples of sustainable products from around the world, this book supplies in-depth analysis of key factors that affect the adoption of sustainable products.

Among other things, the U.S. Congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, corporate spending on compliance increased an estimated $6 billion annually and leading business schools created ethics centers and made ethics training mandatory. Yet despite these reform efforts, corporate trust violations continue. In fact, some of the most insidious practices from the Enron era (notably, disguising financial weakness with offbalance-sheet debt) were front and center again during the global financial crisis of 2008. Why do trust failures continue to occur with such frequency, and how can they be reliably prevented?The authors found that building and sustaining organizational trust is different from building and sustaining interpersonal trust, and that major organizational trust violations are almost never the result of “bad apples” or “rogue employees.” Rather, these violations are predictable in organizations that allow dysfunctional, conflicting or incongruent elements to take root.Trust betrayals occur, the authors note, when the organization actively caters to a group (or groups) at the expense of and even causing harm to another group. Given the global prevalence of social media, online global forums and 24-hour news cycles, a breach of trust with any one stakeholder group can rapidly undermine an organization’s reputation for trust in its broader stakeholder community.Ironically, the authors note, trust failures can act as catalysts for creating a high-trust organization. Much can be learned about how to establish and sustain organizational trustworthiness by examining how organizations successfully restore trust after a major violation. In analyzing cases of companies that have attempted to repair trust, the authors identified three critical stages: investigation, organizational reform and evaluation. Reforms must be evaluated to ensure they are working as intended, and shortfalls must be addressed. Successful trust repair requires taking a systems perspective to accurately diagnose and reform the true faults in the organizational system.","tags":["Security","Governance, Risk Management and Compliance (GRC)","Compliance"]},{"id":"9781947843752","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Corporate Governance in the Aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis, Volume IV","authors":["Dr. Zabihollah Rezaee"],"pages":"200","publication_date":"April 2018","description":"Corporate governance has evolved as a central issue for public companies in the aftermath of the 2007–2009 global financial crisis.

The fact remains that almost every day a disaster strikes in some part of the world. The regular occurrence of natural and man-made disasters has forced the worldwide communities to look for novel solutions to prevent and mitigate such disasters.\n\nThis volume brings together probing studies to disseminate the work of outstanding scholars and practitioners, especially in South Asian countries. Thus, it highlights the need to amalgamate and coordinate the resources and agencies involved in DRM in agriculture to ensure the quality of life to the victims after disasters. The authors incorporate specific themes correlated with DRM in South Asia. They intend to assess: (i) the consequences of distinct disaster risks in agriculture, (ii) the ways in which diverse disaster risk problems are handled in distinct settings, and (iii) the different methodologies embraced by different sectors to prepare for disaster risk.","tags":["Security","Governance, Risk Management and Compliance (GRC)","Operational Risk"]},{"id":"9781631575822","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"A Primer on Corporate Governance","authors":["Jose Luis Rivas"],"pages":"130","publication_date":"October 2019","description":"Mexico is a land inhabited by several indigenous civilizations and was conquered by Spain in 1521. The country is mostly a racial mix between the Spanish and native cultures. It is a traditionalist society where family, religion, and culture play a key role. The role of the marketplace is constrained by the government and local interest groups such as unions, political parties, commerce chambers, and private firms. The market for corporate control is scarce. Corporate governance codes are voluntary.\n\nCorporate ownership is concentrated with few institutional investors. Shareholder activism is uncommon. Corporate boards are single tier in nature. CEO duality is common practice. Boards are made mostly of insiders and shareholder representatives. Independent board members hold minority stakes.\n\nThis book starts by describing the macro context in which Mexico is embedded. We then focus on its corporate governance system: laws, regulatory bodies, code of good governance, stock market and the peculiarities of local business groups. The central part of the book summarizes key characteristics of board structure and networks in the country. The book ends with interviews of two well-known directors and suggestions to move the governance field forward in Mexico.","tags":["Security","Governance, Risk Management and Compliance (GRC)","Governance"]},{"id":"9781606490785","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Sustainability Reporting","authors":["Gwendolen B.

In response, many companies have initiated sustainability and corporate social responsibility programs that represent good first steps toward improving the impact of their organizations on the environment and society. However, unless boards change, many of the initial sustainability efforts launched in corporations are likely to be temporary. For organizations to achieve sustainable effectiveness, they need a corporate board that is designed to lead in a sustainably effective way. This means that boards need to change their way of operating so that they are focused on the integration of social, financial and environmental performance — just as they expect the rest of the organization to be.\n\nThe authors explore examples of companies who have successfully created boards who look at the triple-bottom line performance, measuring not only profits and financial accountability, but also the company’s impact on society and the environment. The authors outline the changes that need to be made for a corporate board to take on the more complex decision-making that involves not only financial performance but social and environmental performance as well.","tags":["Business","Operations","Green Business Practices"]},{"id":"9781606490495","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Sustainable Business","authors":["Nancy E.

All of this has led to growing interest in “corporate social responsibility,” or “CSR,” which has been described as the way that firms integrate social, environmental, and economic concerns into their values, culture, decision making, strategy, and operations in a transparent and accountable manner and thereby establish better practices within the firm, create wealth, and improve society.\n\nThe commitments and activities associated with any CSR initiative should begin with compliance with laws and regulations promulgated by the governmental entities have jurisdiction over the firm’s activities; however, CSR extends well “beyond the law” to include important subjects as to which the law has not been able to keep.
