But why do people follow? Books abound on leaders, but much less is known about followers. In The Leaders We Need, Maccoby steps into this yawning gap in the literature.This insightful book shows that followers have their own powerful motivations to follow. Many relate to their leader as to some important person from the pasta parent, a sibling, a close friend. With major shifts in family structure and other social changes (especially transformations in technology and work life), these transferences” have grown complexmaking leaders’ work more challenging.The key for modern-day leaders?

Where Am I Giving? by New York Times bestselling author Kelsey Timmerman takes you on a journey to meet people who will inspire you to live a purpose-filled, generous life and make the greatest impact you can through your career, time, consumer dollars, and donations.\n\nStarting in his hometown of Muncie, Indiana, and then traveling all over the world (Myanmar, Kenya, India, Nepal, and more), Kelsey explores not only different ways of giving—as a worker, consumer, volunteer, giver, local and global citizen—but also the benefits and effectiveness of these methods. He spends time with monks, students, a refugee, a Marine, a former Hollywood executive, Peace Corps Volunteers, and seasoned aid workers to explore how they give, as well as with the people on the receiving end of their giving.

Many market pundits have decried the concept without examining the underlying dynamics associated with these companies' failures. The truth is, prior business models were built on a flawed business case, not bad technology. In fact, the dot-com bubble created a whole new class of automation that, when applied to conventional businesses, can dramatically improve time to market, competitive response, and customer interaction. This is not virtual business; this is business process virtualization (BPV), and enterprises that don't grasp and apply the principals of BPV will rapidly be rendered obsolete by those that do, being quickly outmaneuvered and displaced in the market.\n\nBPV is the application of networked, intelligent IT infrastructure to enhance skilled personnel, processes, and assets, which enables companies to improve efficiencies, increase competitive advantage, heighten brand awareness, reduce costs, and improve bottom line revenues. Unlike business process automation, BPV focuses on new management approaches for personnel and technology, signaling a fundamental change in the way that we think about business and its objectives.\n\nWhile reading The Case for Virtual Business Processes, you will understand why BPV is critical to the long-term viability of your business, while learning how to leverage your intelligent networked infrastructure using leading-edge products and technologies from Cisco Systems.\n\nThis volume is in the Network Business Series offered by Cisco Press. Books in this series provide IT executives, decision makers, and networking professionals with pertinent information on today's most important technologies and business strategies.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Digital Transformation"]},{"id":"9780132485333","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"The Truth About Dealing with Change","authors":["William S.

NOs surround us—in our workplaces, in our communities and places of worship, in government, in social settings, in schools, and even within our families. Whether you're applying for a job, making a request, looking for a house, dating to find the right mate, seeking some type of approval, selling a product or an idea (or yourself), or trying to organize others into getting something accomplished, you're going to encounter rebuffs and resistance. What can you do to overcome so much negativity? This wise, insightful parable follows our hero who ventures into the Land of NO in search of YES. He watches well-intentioned characters flounder and fail—while noticing other characters using different approaches and achieving success. Our observant hero learns from others' experiences, as well as his own. Through his journey, you will discover how you, too, can persist in the face of frequent NOs — both the NOs uttered by people around you and, perhaps more importantly, the insidious NOs whispered by your own inner voices.The second half of the book takes you from parable to practice—with proven tips, tools, and strategies to help you persevere, develop tenacity, persist in the face of rejection, and overcome the inertia of the status quo. Taken together, the two parts of this book provide a how-to manual that's both practical and entertaining. It will help you find the YESes you seek—faster, more effectively, and with a lot less discouragement and despair in the process.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Development"]},{"id":"9780789736994","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Tricks of the eBay® Business Masters","authors":["Michael Miller"],"pages":"368","publication_date":"August 2007","description":"What tricks or tips will you find in this book?

After his stint in the military, Reynolds returned to J.P. Morgan as a lending officer, where he learned the lessons and began making the connections that would drive his long and illustrious career.\n\nReynolds’s first foray into the executive recruiting industry he helped influence was with the New York search firm William H. Clark Associates. He quickly displayed his talents as a recruiter, and three short years later, on October 2, 1969, he founded Russell Reynolds Associates (RRA). That’s when the executive search business changed—for the better. Until then, the general feeling among business professionals was that executive search firms simply took advantage of easy access to corporate money without delivering real value to clients. With smart, forward-looking, disciplined marketing, Reynolds helped establish executive search professionals as important elements in the smooth running of American business—all while opening new offices around the world.\n\nFilled with cameo appearances by some of the twentieth-century’s greatest business titans, Heads is the fascinating story not only of how RRA became one of the world’s most influential executive search firms but also of how one man transformed an industry.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Innovation"]},{"id":"01520110073SI","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"In Focus/Innovation-The Importance of Considering Personality Type","authors":["Dan Himmerich"],"pages":"5","publication_date":"January 2007","description":"A software design team, in competition to replace a company's core processing system, listened to the coaching of the potential client organization's chief information officer without paying attention to the character of the organization or the personality types of its decision makers.

It is an individual choice, or rather a series of choices that emerges from the complex interaction of personal values with social imperatives. This book explores how and why some people become ethical leaders in morally challenging and complex social environments.\n\nIn Ethical Leadership, Aidan McQuade provides insight into the concept of human agency – the individual’s choice of a course of action in response to the options posed by that individual’s engagement with the social world. He puts forth a new model of human agency – the \"cruciform of agency\" – which recognises that the potential range of individual action emerges from the nature of the resonance that social options strike with personal thoughts. Every action adds to the individual’s personal biography in ways that influence subsequent choices by confirming or changing personal values and hopes, hence influencing the way the individual subsequently thinks about the world.\n\nIn explaining the potential and limits of human agency for ethical leadership, the book establishes a basis for executives, policy makers and academics to conceptualise and develop more robust and realistic approaches for the mitigation of some of the most pressing moral issues facing humanity today. These include the inter-related challenges of modern slavery and global warming, which pose such critical threats to the Earth itself.\n\nIn this book McQuade not only sets an agenda for action but empowers individual leaders to find the moral courage to better advance human rights and preserve the environment even when such action requires unpopular choices.\n\nEvents around the book\n\nLink to a De Gruyter Online Event in which the author and independent human rights consultant Aidan McQuade together with Bernd Vogel, Director of the Henley Centre for Leadership at Henley Business School, Joanne Murphy, Director of Research & Co-Director of the Centre for Leadership, Ethics & Organisation at Queen’s Management School; Ambassador Luis C. deBaca, Professor from Practice, University of Michigan Law School discuss topics such as: what potentially deters leaders from making ethical decisions; what can they draw upon both internally and externally to do the right thing when doing so may be unpopular; how, in the light of fake news, can leaders communicate ethically; and much more:https://youtu.be/EYAAGiCX4cI","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Business Ethics"]},{"id":"9781430233060","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Windows Phone 7 Game Development","authors":["Adam Dawes"],"pages":"586","publication_date":"December 2010","description":"Windows Phone 7 is a powerful mobile computing platform with huge potential for gaming.

Due to their complementary orientations and objectives, these two functions are ideally positioned for a fruitful, synergetic collaboration. UnfortuÂnately, the practical reality in many companies is far removed from this utopia. Sales and marketing personnel fail to communicate effectively, resulting in misunderstandings, frustration, and sometimes sabotage. Instead of supporting each other in creating superior value for customers, they often fight tiresome internal battles that are a drain on profits, efficiency and customer satisfaction. Improving Sales and Marketing Collaboration offers the first comprehensive perspective on the functioning of sales-marketing interfaces in business to business (B2B) companies. We explore their complementary roles in creating superior value for customers, problems that occur, the underlying causes of these problems, and potential solutions. These solutions are accompanied by a series of tools that managers can use to diagnose their sales-marketing interface and develop appropriate approaches to improve this relationship. Additionally, the book discusses a number of challenges that companies encounter and the impacts on their sales-marketing interfaces. The discussions and tools presented in this book provide managers with a deep underÂstanding of this critical interface, allowing them to apply these insights to improve their sales-marketing interface, which helps them create superior value for customers.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Sales"]},{"id":"9781606491713","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Inscrutable Shopper","authors":["Stella Minahan"],"pages":"153","publication_date":"September 2011","description":"The book highlights research undertaken by marketers, social researchers and anthropologists who have an interest in this field.

In weaving together the constellation of political and economic factors that exist across multiple scales, the case is made for how and why so many tourism-dependent areas of the United States have developed a dependency on temporary foreign workforces. Taking a holistic approach, special emphasis is placed on the economic histories of these areas and shifting patterns of employment, seasonality, gentrification, and related housing shortages.\n\nThroughout, the voices of stakeholders involved in every aspect of guestwork are included: human resources managers battling labor shortages, town planners mitigating workforce housing shortages, and attorneys and advocates helping to directly assist migrant workers and affect policy changes. These perspectives are coupled with detailed analysis of state policies regarding guestworker visa programs and labor market stress to illustrate a vivid picture of the precarious lives of the migrant laborers who arrive in the United States.\n\nBe Our Guest serves to specifically address a lacuna in critical tourism studies and the growing concern among practitioners over workforce quality and supply.

The most common type of this financial phenomenon is partial (de facto) dollarization where foreign currencies are used side by side with local currency for saving and borrowing purposes in addition to serving as medium of exchange.\n\nGovernments in these countries have been encouraging dollarization for years by allowing their citizens to save and borrow from local banks in foreign currency. Yet the existence of multiple currencies on banks' balance sheets on both the asset and liability side poses risks to the health and stability of the banking system.\n\nThis book evaluates the practical aspects of partial dollarization in countries such as Turkey, South Korea, Peru, and Cambodia among others. Starting with the origins of the phenomenon, the impact on banking systems and financial depth of the credit markets are discussed along with risks to the banking systems.

That's no surprise because on many levels it resists easy definition. It's a commodity business. No, it's a fashion business. No, it's a consumer products business. No, it's an entertainment business. The fact is it's all of these businesses, each of which addresses and responds to market forces differently. And often, especially with the larger, publicly traded companies--all of these businesses share a balance sheet. This book will provide a concise and in-depth introduction to the structure, practices and market forces that impact the toy industry. It will offer a short history of the industry, a description of the current market landscape, major and emerging industry competitors, contemporary trends, changes and expectations for the future. It will further cover aspects of retailing, consumer behavior, and financial markets as they relate to the industry. As noted, the book will focus primarily on the U.S. toy industry, but will provide guidelines for extrapolating the information to the global toy market and a highlight of those issues, such as manufacturing, that are relatively consistent worldwide. The book is intended to provide a foundation for understanding the diverse and changing nature of the toy industry and to help readers develop a context for appreciating it relevant to other, more predictable and definable industries. Many students--and professionals for that matter--come to the toy industry ill equipped for success because they are unable to understand the various disciplines and business practices it encompasses and therefore unable to apply those practices appropriately for the product or product category.

Due to the fast-paced nature of this world, however, no one was able to take the time to properly codify its lifeblood--namely, valuation and dealmaking. Rosenbaum and Pearl originally responded to this need in 2009 by writing the first edition of the book that they wish had existed when they were trying to break into Wall Street. Investment Banking: Valuation, LBOs, M&A, and IPOs, 3rd Edition is a highly accessible and authoritative book written by investment bankers that explains how to perform the valuation work and financial analysis at the core of Wall Street – comparable companies, precedent transactions, DCF, LBO, M&A analysis...and now IPO analytics and valuation. Using a step-by-step, how-to approach for each methodology, the authors build a chronological knowledge base and define key terms, financial concepts, and processes throughout the book. The genesis for the original book stemmed from the authors' personal experiences as students interviewing for investment banking positions. As they both independently went through the rigorous process, they realized that their classroom experiences were a step removed from how valuation and financial analysis were performed in real-world situations. Consequently, they created this book to provide a leg up to those individuals seeking or beginning careers on Wall Street – from students at undergraduate universities and graduate schools to \"career changers\" looking to break into finance. Now, over 10 years after the release of the first edition, the book is more relevant and topical than ever. It is used in over 200 universities globally and has become a go-to resource for investment banks, private equity, investment firms, and corporations undertaking M&A transactions, LBOs, IPOs, restructurings, and investment decisions. While the fundamentals haven't changed, the environment must adapt to changing market developments and conditions. As a result, Rosenbaum and Pearl have updated their widely adopted book accordingly, turning the latest edition of Investment Banking: Valuation, LBOs, M&A, and IPOs into a unique and comprehensive training package, which includes:\n\nTwo new chapters covering IPOs plus insightful contributions from Nasdaq, the leading U.S. exchange and technology provider for IPOs and new listings, and global law firm Latham & Watkins LLP\nAccess to six downloadable valuation model templates, including Comparable Companies Analysis, Precedent Transactions Analysis, Discounted Cash Flow Analysis, Leveraged Buyout Analysis, and M&A models\nSix-month access to online Wiley Investment Banking Valuation Course featuring bite-sized lessons, over five hours of video lectures, 100+ practice questions, and other investment banking study tools\n\nLaunch your career on Wall Street and hone your financial expertise with Rosenbaum and Pearl’s real-world knowledge and forward-looking guidance in the latest edition of Investment Banking: Valuation, LBOs, M&A, and IPOs.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Banking"]},{"id":"9781292083827","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Logistics & Supply Chain Management, 5th Edition","authors":["Prof. Martin Christopher"],"pages":"328","publication_date":"March 2016","description":"Effective development and management of supply chain networks helps businesses cut costs and enhance customer value.

His job was to convince countries that are strategically important to the U.S.—from Indonesia to Panama—to accept enormous loans for infrastructure development, and to make sure that the lucrative projects were contracted to U.

Saddled with huge debts, these countries came under the control of the United States government, World Bank and other U.S.-dominated aid agencies that acted like loan sharks—dictating repayment terms and bullying foreign governments into submission.This New York Times bestseller exposes international intrigue, corruption, and little-known government and corporate activities that have dire consequences for American democracy and the world.

How to create new sources of competitive advantage to sustain long-term growth, and 2. How to engage leaders at every level of the organization so that they are more proactive and forward-looking in their area of responsibility. The Art of Strategic Leadership uses a unique approach to examine what it means to be a strategic leader. Instead of focusing on the skills, behaviors, and tools found in typical books on strategic leadership, the authors shed light on the attributes and qualities necessary to lead strategic change and help transform a business. Strategic leadership is what modern leadership is all about. Organizations expect leaders to anticipate and be proactive more than ever before. In this book, the authors draw on their vast experience working directly with leaders at all levels and use an intriguing narrative to explain this inside-out approach to understanding strategic leadership. The narrative follows the journey of how one manager discovered these critically important qualities. You will experience first-hand how these values and attributes manifest in the lives of realistic leaders; how they orchestrate long-term strategic change needed for the organization to compete and survive and actively shape the future while delivering short-term results.\n\nThe Art of Strategic Leadership provides the content that will help you informally assess and reflect on your own strategic leadership qualities—those that are strengths and those that indicate areas you need to develop. It will guide you as you incorporate these values and qualities into your own leadership style and become a more effective catalyst for change. This book will help you in the following ways:\n\nDevelop a more proactive, forward-thinking approach to leadership\nApproach strategy from both short- and long-term perspectives\nAdopt the core values and principles of a strategic leader\nModel the qualities exhibited by powerful leaders\n\nStrategic leaders serve as powerful examples to others in the organization. Their qualities and traits spread rapidly to those around them, empowering people at every level to take a more active role in meeting the demands of the future. The Art of Strategic Leadership will help you deepen and broaden your understanding of the core qualities of strategic leadership, leaving you better equipped to lead yourself and your team to a better place and create greater value for customers, owners, and employees.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9780133353471","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"The Truth About Negotiations, 2nd Edition","authors":["Leigh L.

Devora Zack, an avowed introvert and successful consultant who gives presentations to thousands of people at dozens of events annually, feels your pain. She found that other networking books assume that to succeed, you have to act like an extrovert. Not at all. There is another way. Zack politely examines and then smashes to tiny fragments the “dusty old rules” of standard networking advice.

Networking enables you to accomplish the goals that are most important to you. But you can't adopt a style that goes against who you are—and you don't have to.

But not all project managers would agree that the best way to manage a unique project is unique. Many still cling to the old practice of having a methodology that is applied to all projects. \"One size fits all\" is still in common use, and this approach has proven to lead to project failure. Flexibility, situational intelligence, and creativity are essential to deliver project success.\n\nThe need to recognize and master ever-changing requirements and environmental conditions is a tough challenge for professional project managers. The same practices that led to success yesterday may cause failure today. Selecting favorable responses to a given situation is often the most critical factor of the dynamics of success and failure. This book is designed to help project professionals assess a situation, predict the appropriate approach, methodology and achieving styles, and then apply them in a situational fashion.\n\nTo guide project managers in selecting the appropriate responses, Situational Project Management (SitPM) shows how to assess a given project, determine its unique characteristics, and select the appropriate methods to complete the project. With this book, projects managers can use SitPM to develop profiles of their projects on the basis of the projects’ physical characteristics, the project teams’ behavioral characteristics, the enterprise environment, and the market environments receiving project deliverables. These profiles help project managers to determine the appropriate project life cycle approach and leadership style. The book also explores various ways to engage stakeholders on the basis of a project’s SitPM profile.\n\nThe book’s author, Oliver F.

But we can replace the current picture of global upheaval, unsustainability, and uncertainty with one of an economy that works for all people, and the planet. First, we must eliminate rising income inequality within societies where productivity and wage growth has slowed. Second, we must reduce the dampening effect of monopoly market power wielded by large corporations on innovation and productivity gains. And finally, the short-sighted exploitation of natural resources that is corroding the environment and affecting the lives of many for the worse must end.\n\nThe debate over the causes of the broken economy—laissez-faire government, poorly managed globalization, the rise of technology in favor of the few, or yet another reason—is wide open. Stakeholder Capitalism: A Global Economy that Works for Progress, People and Planet argues convincingly that if we don't start with recognizing the true shape of our problems, our current system will continue to fail us. To help us see our challenges more clearly, Schwab—the Founder and Executive Chairman of the World Economic Forum—looks for the real causes of our system's shortcomings, and for solutions in best practices from around the world in places as diverse as China, Denmark, Ethiopia, Germany, Indonesia, New Zealand, and Singapore. And in doing so, Schwab finds emerging examples of new ways of doing things that provide grounds for hope, including:\n\nIndividual agency: how countries and policies can make a difference against large external forces\nA clearly defined social contract: agreement on shared values and goals allows government, business, and individuals to produce the most optimal outcomes\nPlanning for future generations: short-sighted presentism harms our shared future, and that of those yet to be born\nBetter measures of economic success: move beyond a myopic focus on GDP to more complete, human-scaled measures of societal flourishing\n\nBy accurately describing our real situation, Stakeholder Capitalism is able to pinpoint achievable ways to deal with our problems. Chapter by chapter, Professor Schwab shows us that there are ways for everyone at all levels of society to reshape the broken pieces of the global economy and—country by country, company by company, and citizen by citizen—glue them back together in a way that benefits us all.","tags":["Business","Economics"]},{"id":"9781567263510","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"The Enterprise Business Analyst","authors":["Kathleen B.

As organizations face more complex interdependent tasks, leadership must become more personal in order to insure open trusting communication that will make more collaborative problem solving and innovation possible. Without open and trusting communications throughout organizations, they will continue to face the productivity and quality problems that result from reward systems that emphasize individual competition and “climbing the corporate ladder”. Authors Edgar Schein and Peter Schein recognize this reality and call for a reimagined form of leadership that coincides with emerging trends of relationship building, complex group work, diverse workforces, and cultures in which everyone feels psychologically safe. Humble Leadership calls for “here and now” humility based on a deeper understanding of the constantly evolving complexities of interpersonal, group and intergroup relationships that require shifting our focus towards the process of group dynamics and collaboration. Humble Leadership at all levels and in all working groups will be the key to achieving the creativity, adaptiveness, and agility that organizations will need to survive and grow.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9780117094307","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Praxis Framework - An integrated guide to the management of projects, programmes and portfolios","authors":["Adrian Dooley"],"pages":"333","publication_date":"February 2023","description":"An integrated guide to the management of projects, programmes and portfolios.","tags":["Business","Project & Product Management","Program Management"]},{"id":"9781119543862","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Mergers & Acquisitions For Dummies","authors":["Bill Snow"],"pages":"368","publication_date":"September 2018","description":"Mergers & Acquisitions For Dummies (9781119543862) was previously published as Mergers & Acquisitions For Dummies (9780470385562).

Clear problem statements can unlock the energy and innovation that lies within those who do the core work of an organization, whether it be manufacturing, product development, or service. As valuable as good problem formulation can be, it is rarely practiced. Psychologists and cognitive scientists have suggested that the brain is prone to leaping straight from a situation to a solution without pausing to define the problem clearly. Such “jumping to conclusions” can be effective, particularly when done by experts facing extreme time pressure, like fighting a fire or performing emergency surgery. But, when making change in an organization, neglecting to formulate a clear problem statement often prevents innovation and leads to wasted time and money.A good problem statement has five basic elements:• It references something the organization cares about and connects that element to a clear and specific goal;• it contains a clear articulation of the gap between the current state and the goal;• the key variables — the target, the current state, and the gap — are generally quantifiable, even if they cannot be measured objectively;• it is as neutral as possible concerning possible diagnoses or solutions; • and it is sufficiently small in scope that it can be tackled quickly.To tackle complex problems, executives need to complement good problem formulation with a structured approach to problem-solving. The authors recommend an approach using a modified version of the A3 form, which was originally developed by Toyota Motor Corp. to support knowledge sharing in its factories by summarizing a structured problem-solving effort in a single page.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Innovation"]},{"id":"53863MIT64402","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"From Glass Ceilings to Glass Cliffs: A Guide to Jumping, Not Falling","authors":["Keith D.

It demonstrates how the cost and value of a unit of work go down as it moves from creative to skilled to rote, and, finally, to robotic. While the Robot Curve is dangerous to those with brittle or limited skills, it offers unlimited potential to those with metaskills—master skills that enable other skills.\n\nNeumeier believes that the metaskills we need in a post-industrial economy are feeling (intuition and empathy), seeing (systems thinking), dreaming (applied imagination), making (design), and learning (autodidactics). These are not the skills we were taught in school. Yet they’re the skills we’ll need to harness the curve.\n\nIn explaining each of the metaskills, he offers encouragement and concrete advice for mastering their intricacies. At the end of the book he lays out seven changes that education can make to foster these important talents.\n\nThis is a rich, exciting book for forward-thinking educators, entrepreneurs, designers, artists, scientists, and future leaders in every field. It comes illustrated with clear diagrams and a 16-page color photo essay. Those who enjoy this book may be interested in its slimmer companion, The 46 Rules of Genius, also by Marty Neumeier.\n\n        \n\nThings you’ll learn in Metaskills:\n\n- How to stay ahead of the “robot curve”\n\n- How to account for “latency” in your predictions\n\n- The 9 most common traps of systems behavior\n\n- How to distinguish among 4 types of originality\n\n- The 3 key steps in generating innovative solutions\n\n- 6 ways to think like Steve Jobs\n\n- How to recognize the 3 essential qualities of beauty\n\n- 24 aesthetic tools you can apply to any kind of work\n\n- 10 strategies to trigger breakthrough ideas\n\n- Why every team needs an X-shaped person\n\n- How to overcome the 5 forces arrayed against simplicity\n\n- 6 tests for measuring the freshness of a concept  \n\n- How to deploy the 5 principles of “uncluding”\n\n- The 10 tests for measuring great work\n\n- How to sell an innovative concept to an organization\n\n- 12 principles for constructing a theory of learning\n\n- How to choose a personal mission for the real world\n\n- The 4 levels of professional achievement\n\n- 7 steps for revolutionizing education\n\nFrom the back cover\n\n\"Help! A robot ate my job!\" If you haven't heard this complaint yet, you will. Today's widespread unemployment is not a jobs crisis. It's a talent crisis. Technology is taking every job that doesn't need a high degree of creativity, humanity, or leadership. The solution?

Everyone can learn to think creatively, analytically, and quickly with brain-boosting activities for the workplace. Unimaginative. Risk-adverse. Prone to group-think. These are not just empty complaints about today’s employees. A recent article in Newsweek found solid data that proves a “creativity crisis” is plaguing America. Yet critical thinking, the ability to approach a problem both analytically and creatively, is the bedrock of success for companies and their people. Fortunately, it’s a skill that can be learned. The Critical Thinking Tool Kit aims to get employees thinking better and faster with 35 hands-on activities and ready-to-use assessments. Team members work on challenging assumptions, brainstorming divergent ideas, and then pinpointing the ones that best benefit an organization. And they’ll learn to do it in real-life speed—quickly! The training exercises in The Critical Thinking Tool Kit offer an invigorating departure from the everyday—with the potential for big payoffs in the form of enhanced “on-your-feet” thinking, innovative problem-solving, and profitable idea generation from everyone on the team.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Development","Critical Thinking"]},{"id":"9781786300690","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Venture Capital and the Financing of Innovation","authors":["Bernard Guilhon","Sandra Montchaud"],"pages":"196","publication_date":"February 2020","description":"The funding of innovative projects that are fundamentally ambiguous often leads to situations where decision-making is difficult. However, decision-making can be improved by practices such as syndication and step-by-step funding. The dynamic of this industry requires us to consider the economic and institutional variables that make this system coherent in English-speaking countries, but conversely reduce it to a privileged niche by the leading authorities in Europe and France.\n\nThis book proposes two guiding ideas. The first idea presents innovation as a very uncertain process. This modifies the decision-making in the entrepreneurial ecosystem, with intervention upstream in regards to stronger foundations, evaluations and selection of projects. The second idea is that the actors hold onto partial knowledge in a context where their attention span is limited. These cognitive limitations need the formation of networks, and lead to mutual and complementary dependency relations.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Innovation"]},{"id":"9781439821824","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Healthcare Sensor Networks","authors":["Daniel Huei Lai","Marimuthu Palaniswami","Rezaul Begg"],"pages":"462","publication_date":"April 2016","description":"From network deployment to secure monitoring, this book addresses the latest developments in healthcare sensor networks-medical monitoring devices implanted on the body or in the surrounding infrastructure.

The growth and proliferation of innovation-driven startup activity is profound, unprecedented, and global in scope. Today, it is understood that communities of support and knowledge-sharing go along with other resources. The importance of collaboration and a long-term commitment has gained wider acceptance. These principles are adopted in many startup communities throughout the world.\n\nAnd yet, much more work is needed. Startup activity is highly concentrated in large cities. Governments and other actors such as large corporations and universities are not collaborating with each other nor with entrepreneurs as well as they could. Too often, these actors try to control activity or impose their view from the top-down, rather than supporting an environment that is led from the bottom-up. We continue to see a disconnect between an entrepreneurial mindset and that of many actors who wish to engage with and support entrepreneurship. There are structural reasons for this, but we can overcome many of these obstacles with appropriate focus and sustained practice.\n\nNo one tells this story better than Brad Feld and Ian Hathaway. The Startup Community Way: Evolving an Entrepreneurial Ecosystem explores what makes startup communities thrive and how to improve collaboration in these rapidly evolving, complex environments.\n\nThe Startup Community Way is an explanatory guide for startup communities. Rooted in the theory of complex systems, this book establishes the systemic properties of entrepreneurial ecosystems and explains why their complex nature leads people to make predictable mistakes. As complex systems, value creation occurs in startup communities primarily through the interaction of the \"parts\" - the people, organizations, resources, and conditions involved - not the parts themselves. This continual process of bottom-up interactions unfolds naturally, producing value in novel and unexpected ways. Through these complex, emergent processes, the whole becomes greater and substantially different than what the parts alone could produce.\n\nBecause of this, participants must take a fundamentally different approach than is common in much of our civic and professional lives. Participants must take a whole-system view, rather than simply trying to optimize their individual part. They must prioritize experimentation and learning over planning and execution. Complex systems are uncertain and unpredictable. They cannot be controlled, only guided and influenced. Each startup community is unique. Replication is enticing but impossible. The race to become \"The Next Silicon Valley\" is futile - even Silicon Valley couldn't recreate itself.\n\nThis book:\n\nOffers practical advice for entrepreneurs, community builders, government officials, and other stakeholders who want to harness the power of entrepreneurship in their city\nDescribes the core components of startup communities and entrepreneurial ecosystems, as well as an explanation of the differences between these two related, but distinct concepts\nAdvances a new framework for effective startup community building based on the theory of complex systems and insights from systems thinking\nIncludes contributions from leading entrepreneurial voices\nIs a must-have resource for entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, executives, business and community leaders, economic development authorities, policymakers, university officials, and anyone wishing to understand how startup communities work anywhere in the world","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Entrepreneurship"]},{"id":"9781118339329","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Value Investors: Lessons from the World's Top Fund Managers","authors":["Ronald Chan","Bruce C.

Once you have ordinary intelligence, what you need is the temperament to control the urges that get other people into trouble in investing.\"\n\nIn an attempt to understand exactly what kind of temperament Buffett was talking about, Ronald W. Chan interviewed 12 value-investing legends from around the world, learning how their personal background, culture, and life experiences have shaped their investment mindset and strategy. The Value Investors: Lessons from the World's Top Fund Managers is the result.\n\nFrom 106-year-old Irving Kahn, who worked closely with \"father of value investing\" Benjamin Graham and remains active today, and 95-year-old Walter Schloss (described by Warren Buffett as the \"super-investor from Graham-and-Dodsville\"), to the co-founders of Hong Kong-based Value Partners, Cheah Cheng Hye and V-Nee Yeh, and Francisco García Paramés of Spain's Bestinver Asset Management, Chan chose investment luminaries to help him understand the international appeal - and success - of value investing. All of these men became strong advocates of the approach despite considerable age and cultural differences. Chan finds out why.\n\nIn The Value Investors, readers will also discover how these investors, each of whom has a unique value perspective, have consistently beaten the stock market over the years. Do they share a trait that allows this to happen? Is there a winning temperament that turns the ordinary investor into an extraordinary one?

Nearly three out of four new products or services, i.e., their startups, miss their revenue and profit goals–or fail entirely.\n\nIt’s a misconception that high-tech startups fail only because of the failing products or finances. The failures could also be because of erroneous choice of technology platforms, development teams or methodology, or even the project execution. Accordingly, this book takes a holistic view of a startups’ aesthetics that enables it to become attractive for all stakeholders especially investors in all aspects of its operations at all stages of its lifecycle.\n\nThis book:\n\nLooks at aspects of venture capital financing and what investors look for in a contemporary startup.\nShows how only an overarching aspiration for a startup to become a Unicorn is sufficient to explain the typical characteristics of legendry Silicon Valley Unicorns like Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter.\nCovers major application areas of current/future interest, namely, intelligent systems, intelligent assistants, wireless sensor networks, Internet of Things (IoT), and blockchain systems.\nIntroduces the contemporary skills-set in demand for Startups.\n\nTo succinctly cover all aspects of a contemporary startup, Unleashing the Startup Unicorn is organized to reflect the natural grouping of competencies that are essential for entrepreneurial ventures–from conception to successful exit. To understand and analyze these competencies, the book uses an extended 9S model inspired by the pioneering McKinsey 7S model.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Entrepreneurship"]},{"id":"9780321620682","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Designful Company","authors":["Marty Neumeier"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"December 2008","description":"Part manifesto, part handbook, THE DESIGNFUL COMPANY provides a lively overview of a growing trend in management—design thinking as a business competence. According to the author, traditional managers have relied on a two-step process to make decisions, which he calls “knowing” and “doing.” Yet in today’s innovation-driven marketplace, managers need to insert a middle step, called “making.” Making is a phase in which assumptions are questioned, futures are imagined, and prototypes are tested, producing a wide range of options that didn’t exist before. The reader is challenged to consider the author’s bold assertion: There can be no real innovation without design. Those who are new to Marty Neumeier’s “whiteboard” series may want to ramp up with the first two books, THE BRAND GAP and ZAG. Both are easy reads. Covered in THE DESIGNFUL COMPANY: - the top 10 “wicked problems” that only design can solve - a new, broader definition of design - why designing trumps deciding in an era of change - how to harness the “organic drivetrain” of value creation - how aesthetics add nuance to managing - 16 levers to transform your company - why you should bring design management inside - how to assemble an innovation metateam - how to recognize and reward talent From the back cover: The complex business problems we face today can’t be solved with the same thinking that created them. Instead, we need to start from a place outside traditional management. Forget total quality. Forget top-down strategy. In an era of fast-moving markets and leap-frogging innovations, we can no longer “decide” the way forward. Today we have to “design” the way forward—or risk ending up in the fossil layers of history.

They also know that they are bound to fail in doing so. But this discouraging prospect is not because they won't be able to solve a technological or strategic problem.

In the chaotic aftermath of the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, they successfully completed trades worth trillions of dollars in a multitude of financial instruments across listed and over-the-counter markets, and so helped avert financial Armageddon.\n\nThat success transformed the business of clearing. Governments and regulators around the world gave CCPs and the clearing services they provide a front-line role in protecting the global economy from future excesses of finance. CCPs, which mitigate risk in financial markets, responded by greatly expanding their activities, notably in markets for over-the-counter derivatives, and often in fierce competition with one another.\n\nIn The Risk Controllers, journalist and author Peter Norman describes how CCPs operate, how they handled the Lehman default, and the challenges they now face. Because central counterparty clearing is a complex business with a long history that continues to influence decisions and structures even in today's fast changing world, The Risk Controllers explores the development of CCPs and clearing from the earliest times to the present.\n\nIt draws on the experiences of the people who helped to shape the business of clearing today. It sets the development of CCPs and clearing in the broader context of changes in society, politics and regulation. The book examines turning points, such as the 1987 stock market crash, that set clearing on a new path and the impact of long running trends, including the exponential growth of computer power and the ebb and flow of globalisation.\n\nWritten in non-technical language, The Risk Controllers provides a unique and accessible guide to CCPs and clearing. It is essential reading for clearing professionals, legislators and regulators whose job it is to take this vitally important business into the future.\n\n\"The recent crisis has, thankfully, renewed interest in the importance of central counterparties: how they can help preserve stability or, as Hong Kong showed in 1987, undermine stability if they are not super sound. Peter Norman's book places the role of clearing houses in a historical context, and explains why the financial system's plumbing matters so much. It should be read by anyone interested in building safer capital markets.\"\n\nPaul Tucker, Deputy Governor Financial Stability, Bank of England","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Financial Markets"]},{"id":"9781118104507","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Microsoft® Office 365 For Dummies®","authors":["Ken Withee","Jennifer Reed"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"February 2012","description":"The information you need to create a virtual office that can be accessed anywhere\n\nMicrosoft Office 365 is a revolutionary technology that allows individuals and companies of all sizes to create and maintain a virtual office in the cloud.

Drawing on his unsurpassed expertise working with HR executives, he walks through each crucial financial issue associated with strategic talent management, including the quantifiable links between workforces and business value, the cost-benefit analysis of HR and strategic financial initiatives, and specific issues related to total rewards programs. Unlike finance books for non-financial managers, Financial Analysis for HR Managers focuses entirely on core HR issues.\n\n¿\n\nMore than ever before, HR practitioners must empirically demonstrate a clear link between their practices and firm performance.

Wrong, says Roger Martin in The Opposable Mind. Though following best practice can help in some ways, it also poses a danger. By emulating what a great leader did in a particular situation, you'll likely be terribly disappointed with your own results. Why? Your situation is different.\n\nInstead of focusing on what exceptional leaders do, we need to understand and emulate how they think. Successful businesspeople engage in what Martin calls integrative thinking, creatively resolving the tension in opposing models by forming entirely new and superior ones. Drawing on stories of leaders as diverse as AG Lafley of Procter & Gamble, Meg Whitman of eBay, Victoria Hale of the Institute for One World Health, and Nandan Nilekani of Infosys, Martin shows how integrative thinkers are relentlessly diagnosing and synthesizing by asking probing questions including: What are the causal relationships at work here? and What are the implied trade-offs?\n\nMartin also presents a model for strengthening your integrative thinking skills by drawing on different kinds of knowledge including conceptual and experiential knowledge.\n\nIntegrative thinking can be learned, and The Opposable Mind helps you master this vital skill.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Strategic Thinking"]},{"id":"9781422160800","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Attention Economy","authors":["Thomas H.

Christensen","Thomas Bartman","Derek van Bever"],"pages":"10","publication_date":"October 2016","description":"“The landscape of failed attempts at business model innovation is crowded -- and becoming more so,” observe authors Clayton M. Christensen, Thomas Bartman, and Derek van Bever. In order to change this, the authors argue, executives need to understand that business models develop through predictable stages over time -- and that each business model stage is associated with certain business priorities. Executives should evaluate whether a business model innovation they are considering is consistent with the current priorities of their existing business model. This analysis matters greatly, the authors write, since it drives a whole host of decisions about where the new initiative should be housed, how its performance should be measured, and how the resources and processes at work in the company will either support it or extinguish it.\n\nBusiness models, the authors point out, “by their very nature are designed not to change, and they become less flexible and more resistant to change as they develop over time.” Interdependencies between different elements of the business model grow over time, and the business unit develops increasingly ingrained approaches to solving problems.\n\nThe authors describe the development of a business model across time as a journey whose progress and route are predictable -- although the time that it takes a business model to follow this journey will differ by industry and circumstance. In the authors’ view, a business model, which in an established company is typically embodied in a business unit, travels a one-way journey, beginning with the creation of the new business unit and its business model, then shifting to sustaining and growing the business unit, and ultimately moving to wringing efficiency from it. Each stage of the journey supports a specific type of innovation, builds a particular set of interdependencies into the business model, and is responsive to a particular set of performance metrics.\n\nThe authors argue that this road-map view of business model evolution helps explain why most attempts to alter the course of existing business units fail. Unaware of the interdependencies and rigidities that constrain business units to pursuing their existing journey, managers attempt to compel existing business units to pursue new priorities or attempt to create a new business inside an existing unit. Instead, the authors recommend that when considering an innovation opportunity, executives determine how consistent the opportunity is with the priorities of the existing business model. The only types of innovation you can perform naturally within an existing business model, according to the authors, are those that build on and improve the existing model and accelerate its progress. They also recommend that executives focus on creating new business models rather than changing existing ones.\n\nBased on their research on business model innovation, the authors offer additional recommendations for companies that seek to turn the act of creating a new business and a new business model into a repeatable process at the corporate level. The authors conclude that “over the long term, the greatest innovation risk a company can take is to decide not to create new businesses that decouple the company’s future from that of its current business units.”","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Innovation"]},{"id":"53863MIT67106","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Three Meeting Red Flags That Skilled Leaders Notice","authors":["Phillip G.

Nomanagement activity is more important than having clarity about how the organization creates, delivers,and captures value. It requires, among other things, knowing what customers want, how value can bebest delivered, and how to enlist strategic partners to achieve maximum benefit.Although the ability to develop strong value propositions can enable companies to \"get by, \" theauthors argue that many of today's most successful businesses are those that can place themselves in the\"sweet spot\" of business model scalability. If managers are incapable of factoring scalability attributesinto their business model design, they risk being left behind, much the way bookstores owned byBorders Group Inc. were eclipsed by Amazon.com Inc.In the course of their research, the authors identified five patterns by which companies can achieve scalability.The first pattern involves adding new distribution channels. The second entails freeing the business from traditionalcapacity constraints. The third involves outsourcing capital investments to partners that, in effect, becameparticipants in the business model. The fourth is having customers and other partners assume multiple roles inthe business model. And the fifth pattern is to establish platform models in which even competitors maybecome customers. Based on these patterns, the authors developed a framework for identifying potential leversfor business model scalability along with a road map that managers can use to improve their business models.Over and above the need to create value propositions that are difficult for competitors to replicate,managers need to develop business models that are capable of achieving positive returns and acceleratingreturns on the investments made. Merely identifying synergies, the authors note, doesn't necessarilylead to improvements in business model scalability. They write: \"To achieve scalability, managers andentrepreneurs need to remove capacity constraints. They have opportunities to do this in a variety ofways: by collaborating with partners; by encouraging partners to play multiple roles in the businessmodel; by creating platforms to attract new partners; or even by working with current competitors.\"","tags":["Business","Business Strategy"]},{"id":"53863MIT64329","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"How to Engage Skeptics in Culture Interventions","authors":["Amy C.

In this iconoclastic new book, Susan Fowler reveals compelling insights and actions to help you master and maintain your motivation. Motivation is at the heart of everything you do and everything you want to do but don't. Unfortunately, the ways we typically motivate ourselves don't work. Relying on sheer determination eventually becomes exhausting—it's not sustainable. And even setting goals can backfire—if you're not setting them for the right reasons. Susan Fowler says motivation is energy, and what matters is the quality, not the quantity. Traditional “motivators” such as fear, guilt, or the promise of a reward provide low-quality, short-term energy. Drawing on the latest empirical research, she proves that high-quality, optimal motivation is a skill that you can learn and apply. Science tells us that satisfying three basic needs—for choice, connection, and competence—is essential to optimal motivation. You need to feel like you've picked your path, not that you're being driven down it. Your goal should be linked to people or a purpose meaningful to you. And you want to continually learn and grow. Through practical exercises and eye-opening stories, Fowler shows you how to identify and shift the quality of your motivation. The skill to master your motivation is important—it may be your greatest opportunity to evolve, grow in wisdom, and be the light the world so desperately needs.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Development","Confidence / Motivation"]},{"id":"9781119403692","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Wealth Management Unwrapped, Revised and Expanded","authors":["Charlotte Beyer"],"pages":"208","publication_date":"August 2017","description":"You are the CEO of My Wealth, Inc. — so Take Charge!\n\nWealth Management Unwrapped provides you with the tools and tips you need to take back control and more effectively manage your money.

The more emotional the experience, the deeper it is branded into your memory. Experience has a massive impact on buying decisions. Every touch point, every time you or someone in your company engages a customer, it creates an experience - something they remember. When they have a negative experience, they tend to vote with their feet (and their wallets) and head straight to your competitors. When customers have positive emotional experiences, it anchors them to your brand, your product or service, and ultimately to you.\n\nIn the twenty-first century, competitive advantages derived from unique products are services are short-lived because competitors are able to quickly and easily duplicate or match your offering.

Furthermore, such texts leave it up to the reader to apply their lessons so as to gain value from the knowledge, and to reinforce that knowledge through practice. The \"theory of the firm\" does not resonate with most corporate executives. But in fact, economic forces drive the context for all our important business decisions: When and how much to expand or contract; which markets to enter and exit; when to raise or lower prices; and how to invest surplus resources (retained earnings for companies and savings for individuals). This book is an application of economics (both micro and macroeconomics) to one of the central challenges of our age for any citizen in a developed economy: How to invest their resources in a changed economic landscape. It contends that the quarter century from the early 1980s to the late 2000s was a unique historical period, creating an exceptionally benign commercial and investing environment. It will not return once the Great Recession is firmly behind us. The core message of the book is an extended application of economic principles and reasoning, phrased in a form readily digestible to any interested layman. It can be used as a companion to a traditional economics text, or as a stand-alone application-oriented text. The main application explored is of investment decisions of corporations seeking to deploy retained earnings, and of individuals seeking to prepare for the day when they no longer rely on wage income.","tags":["Business","Economics"]},{"id":"9781606494738","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Financing New Ventures","authors":["Geoffrey Gregson"],"pages":"268","publication_date":"January 2014","description":"Many business ventures today are looking to attract externalfinancing, with an emphasis on business angelinvestment.

And although most people see pirates as solitary anarchists out to destroy capitalism, it turns out the opposite is true. They are the ones who forge the path.In The Pirate Organization, Rodolphe Durand and Jean-Philippe Vergne argue that piracy drives capitalism’s evolution and foreshadows the direction of the economy. Through a rigorous yet engaging analysis of the history and golden ages of piracy, the authors show how pirates form complex and sophisticated organizations that change the course of capitalism. Surprisingly, pirate organizations also behave in predictable ways: challenging widespread norms; controlling resources, communication, and transportation; maintaining trade relationships with other communities; and formulating strategies favoring speed and surprise.

Doerr","Neil Rackham"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"May 2014","description":"What do winners of major sales do differently than the sellers who almost won, but ultimately came in second place?\n\nMike Schultz and John Doerr, bestselling authors and world-renowned sales experts, set out to find the answer. They studied more than 700 business-to-business purchases made by buyers who represented a total of $3.1 billion in annual purchasing power. When they compared the winners to the second-place finishers, they found surprising results.\n\nNot only do sales winners sell differently, they sell radically differently, than the second-place finishers.\n\nIn recent years, buyers have increasingly seen products and services as replaceable. You might think this would mean that the sale goes to the lowest bidder. Not true! A new breed of seller—the insight seller—is winning the sale with strong prices and margins even in the face of increasing competition and commoditization.\n\nIn Insight Selling, Schultz and Doerr share the surprising results of their research on what sales winners do differently, and outline exactly what you need to do to transform yourself and your team into insight sellers. They introduce a simple three-level model based on what buyers say tip the scales in favor of the winners:\n\nLevel 1 \"Connect.\" Winners connect the dots between customer needs and company solutions, while also connecting with buyers as people.\n\nLevel 2 \"Convince.\" Winners convince buyers that they can achieve maximum return, that the risks are acceptable, and that the seller is the best choice among all options.\n\nLevel 3 \"Collaborate.\" Winners collaborate with buyers by bringing new ideas to the table, delivering new ideas and insights, and working with buyers as a team.\n\nThey also found that much of the popular and current advice given to sellers can damage sales results. Insight Selling is both a strategic and tactical guide that will separate the good advice from the bad, and teach you how to put the three levels of selling to work to inspire buyers, influence their agendas, and maximize value. If you want to find yourself and your team in the winner's circle more often, this book is a must-read.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Sales"]},{"id":"9781118716168","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Wellbeing: A Complete Reference Guide, Volume VI, Interventions and Policies to Enhance Wellbeing","authors":["Cary Cooper","Felicia Huppert"],"pages":"704","publication_date":"March 2014","description":"Using an evidence-based approach and case studies from a wide range of life domains, Interventions and Policies to Enhance Wellbeing examines the most successful existing strategies to promote wellbeing and mental health.\n\nDiscusses the results of the latest research in the science of wellbeing and their implications for improved learning, creativity, productivity, relationships, and health\n\nCovers interventions for individuals across the lifespan, as well as those for organizations, communities, and entire populations\n\nLooks at policy initiatives and approaches with a focus on the integration of new technology and the role of the media\n\nPart of the six-volume Wellbeing: A Complete Reference Guide, which brings together leading research from across the social sciences","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Development"]},{"id":"9781119647911","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Measuring Business Interruption Losses and Other Commercial Damages, 3rd Edition","authors":["Patrick A.

They either address the wrong problems, or they keep beating on the same solutions, wondering why things don't improve. This is when you need an objective way to look at the problems. This is the time to get some data.\" Watts S. Humphrey, from the Foreword\n\nThis book, drawing on work done at the Software Engineering Institute and other organizations, shows how to use measurements to manage and improve software processes. The authors explain specifically how quality characteristics of software products and processes can be quantified, plotted, and analyzed so the performance of software development activities can be predicted, controlled, and guided to achieve both business and technical goals. The measurement methods presented, based on the principles of statistical quality control, are illuminated by application examples taken from industry.\n\nAlthough many of the methods discussed are applicable to individual projects, the book's primary focus is on the steps software development organizations can take toward broad-reaching, long-term success. The book particularly addresses the needs of software managers and practitioners who have already set up some kind of basic measurement process and are ready to take the next step by collecting and analyzing software data as a basis for making process decisions and predicting process performance.\n\nHighlights of the book include:\n\nInsight into developing a clear framework for measuring process behavior\n\nDiscussions of process performance, stability, compliance, capability, and improvement\n\nExplanations of what you want to measure (and why) and instructions on how to collect your data\n\nStep-by-step guidance on how to get started using statistical process control\n\nIf you have responsibilities for product quality or process performance and you are ready to use measurements to manage, control, and predict your software processes, this book will be an invaluable resource.","tags":["Business","Project & Product Management","Product Management","Measuring IT / Software"]},{"id":"9781119531692","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"From Impossible to Inevitable, 2nd Edition","authors":["Aaron Ross","Jason Lemkin"],"pages":"336","publication_date":"June 2019","description":"Break your revenue records with Silicon Valley’s “growth bible”“This book makes very clear how to get to hyper-growth and the work needed to actually get there”\n\nWhy are you struggling to grow your business when everyone else seems to be crushing their goals?

Although it clearly supports growth, its significance is even greater for developed countries, where the market has recovered remarkably since the global financial crisis. The number and heterogeneity of motivations to trade credit justify the variability observed in the data on global trading, and the role of trade credit has become crucial in supply chain coordination.\n\nA range of diverse trade credit finance solutions are available and include products and services offered by financial intermediaries and market products, highlighting a very interesting set of intermediate solutions that have emerged as a result of new technologies utilized in financial services. For financiers trade credit is an attractive option, but an in-depth evaluation of the possibility of losses forms the basis of a deep understating of numerous sources that can create credit risk (default and dilution risk).

Barner"],"pages":"256","publication_date":"April 2006","description":"The key to sustained competitive advantage in any industry is not size, image, or technology. It's talent, particularly at the leadership level. Your organization's future depends on its ability to identify, retain, and prepare a dependable \"bench\" -- its next generation of leaders -- continuously. Over the next several years, the \"baby boomers\" who have engineered some of America's greatest business growth will be retiring in huge numbers, creating talent gaps and unprecedented competition to fill them. How can your company stay ahead of the curve? Bench Strength offers a step-by-step approach to building a powerful talent strategy that will ensure the perpetual availability of potential leaders. Author Robert Barner leads you through important decisions about talent focus, including: The Make or Buy Decision: Should your talent strategy be focused primarily on developing leadership from within, or on acquiring \"ready-made\" leaders from other organizations? The Capstone/Foundation Decision: Should you concentrate development efforts on a few high-potential individuals, or spread resources across a broader section of your overall leadership bench? The Stream or Pool Decision: Should you identify successor candidates for specific leadership positions, or retain pools of potential leaders who may be qualified for any of a number of leadership positions as they become available? The Trade-Up or Build-Out Decision: Should you build bench strength by progressively \"trading up\" from marginally performing managers to high performers, or quickly expand the leadership talent base by hiring a large group of potential managers simultaneously? The Best-in-Industry or World Class Decision: Is your best talent strategy to focus on your own industry, or to look for cream-of-the-crop talent regardless of particular industry experience? Each pair of strategic options includes clear examples and all-important \"payoffs and pitfalls\" that will help you make the right decision based on the organization's unique needs. Bench Strength also gives you effective methods for continuously monitoring how your company's talent measures up against that of external candidates, further informing your \"make versus buy\" and other talent decisions. The book also reveals the Seven Principles of Talent Deployment, which will help align your strongest players with your most critical and challenging needs. And the author's \"war games\" approach to pre-testing of talent strategies will put the organization in fine shape to address both in-house \"what-if\" issues and new developments in industry or market conditions. Barner also advocates for the creation of a new position in your organization, that of Chief Talent Officer. A new and increasingly recognized strategy, the hiring of a talent executive is a significant step with lasting implications, so you'll want to find out as much as you can about the potential talent officer. To that end, the author presents ten detailed questions to ask CTO candidates, the answers to which will illuminate their approach to evaluating talent, their ability to play a \"point position\" for the organization, their knowledge of your industry and the company's place within it, and much more. Leadership talent is one of the most critical needs of any organization. Bench Strength provides a comprehensive, practical approach and specific action steps for making smart talent decisions and putting together a deep and versatile team -- for today and for the future.","tags":["Business","Human Resources","Finding Talent"]},{"id":"9781119539803","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Supernova Multiplier","authors":["Robert D.

However, the authors argue, that standard cost-benefit assessment is seriously incomplete when applied to individual innovators. These individuals can gain significant benefits from participation in a development process as well as — or even instead of — benefits from using or selling the innovation created. When innovation project sponsors can offer volunteer innovators such benefits, the net cost of those innovation projects can be much lower. The authors define “innovation process benefits” as all those benefits that innovators will get if they directly participate in the innovation development process — and will not get if somebody just hands them the solution to an innovation challenge. Important examples of innovation process benefits include enjoyment and learning obtained from participation in the project, as well as reputational gains obtained from being known as having made high-quality contributions. Innovation process benefits are distinct from benefits associated with using or selling the innovation created. They are only available to participants in the development process. Together with other researchers, one of the authors studied the range of motivations experienced by consumer- innovators — individuals creating or modifying consumer products to better fit their personal needs. Both a study of Finnish consumer-innovators and a study of consumer-innovators in whitewater kayaking found that motivations for these innovators included not only a desire to use or sell their innovations but also enjoyment and learning gained from the innovation process, as well as a desire to help others. The authors note that designing innovation projects with individual volunteers’ innovation process benefits in mind can amplify total investment in R&D and innovation in societies by making it attractive for some consumers to devote some fraction of their eisure time to that purpose. The net effect is to make innovation cheaper from the societal perspective and also from the perspective of an innovation project sponsor.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Innovation"]},{"id":"9781604912227","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Leadership in Action: Good Choices—Making Better Decisions by Knowing How Best to Decide","authors":["Christopher Musselwhite"],"pages":"5","publication_date":"October 2009","description":"Effective decision makers know that deciding what's best and knowing how best to decide are two very different skills.

Yet they have long had a dream: to take that special skill set and use it, on their own terms, in a startup business.\n\nThis pattern is romanticized by the media in the form of the \"tech entrepreneur\"—the guy brainstorming with buddies in a garage who ends up selling his startup for millions.

For that matter, what mental processes, frames of reference, hard knocks, and lessons learned make up the \"back story\" behind any startup success?

Drucker argues that what underlies the current malaise of so many large and successful organizations worldwide is that their theory of the business no longer works. The story is a familiar one: a company that was a superstar only yesterday finds itself stagnating and frustrated, in trouble and, often, in a seemingly unmanageable crisis. The root cause of nearly every one of these crises is not that things are being done poorly. It is not even that the wrong things are being done. Indeed, in most cases, the right things are being done—but fruitlessly. What accounts for this apparent paradox? The assumptions on which the organization has been built and is being run no longer fit reality. These are the assumptions that shape any organization's behavior, dictate its decisions about what to do and what not to do, and define what an organization considers meaningful results. These assumptions are what Drucker calls a company's theory of the business.\n\nThe Harvard Business Review Classics series offers you the opportunity to make seminal Harvard Business Review articles a part of your permanent management library.

Target setting forms part of the budgeting process and the performance management of business units and individuals. Unfortunately the behavioral impacts of target setting on performance are not well understood, and this can lead to serious consequences such as game playing. Target setting is an under-researched area. This book will help you fill the gap in target setting for performance. The pivotal issue in target setting is that it is an art as well as a science. Perhaps more of an art, requiring a balance between the psychologies of the people taking initiatives, the science of estimating probabilities and aligning with strategies, coupled with the effects of incentives. Another feature of this book is how the authors drew on ideas and research across disciplines, which is rarely done in this field. Inside this book, you will be introduced to some of the important methods in target setting such as forecasting, sensitivity analysis, and probability analysis; all of which include practical examples to show how these techniques can be directly applied. In the end, you'll learn how interrelated the various parts of organizational activities are and how they impact on each other, which is important since target setting must include an understanding of the organizational context (e.g., people, competitive environment, structure, strategy) as well as the impact of incentive compensation and information flows.","tags":["Business","Human Resources","Reviews & Metrics","Goals"]},{"id":"9781633692381","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"The Virtual Manager Collection (3 Books) (HBR 20-Minute Manager Series)","authors":["Harvard Business Review"],"pages":"432","publication_date":"July 2016","description":"Learn how to work productively from anywhere.\n\nToday we have greater control over where and when we work.

It looks at the ways of reaping a new competitive advantage by substantially reducing the hidden cost of fraud. Aimed at a wide business community and based on solid research, it is the only book to put forward an evidence-based model for combating corporate fraud and financial crime.\n\nDespite its increase and capture of the news headlines, corporate fraud is largely ignored by most organizations. Fraud is responsible for losses of up to nine percent of revenues—sometimes more. Yet, most organizations don't believe they have a problem and don't always measure fraud losses. This highlights an area for capturing a competitive advantage—with the right counter-fraud strategy, massive losses due to the cost of fraud can be reduced for a fraction of the return.\n\nAdvocates a new model for tackling fraud and illustrates theories with best practice examples from around the world\n\nThe authors have close links with the Counter Fraud Professional Accreditation Board: Jim Gee is a world-renowned expert in the field, and has advised private companies and governments from more than 35 countries.

Leadership is a living process—and life means growth. As Ken Blanchard and Mark Miller write in the introduction, “the path to increased influence, impact, and leadership effectiveness is paved with personal growth.… Our capacity to grow determines our capacity to lead. It's really that simple.” Great Leaders Grow shows leaders and aspiring leaders precisely which areas to focus on so they can remain effective throughout their lives.Debbie Brewster—the protagonist from Blanchard and Miller's international bestseller The Secret—returns in this book to mentor her mentor's son, Blake, as he begins his career. Now an accomplished leader herself, Debbie shows Blake how growing as a leader and as a human being are inextricably linked. “How well you and I serve will be determined by the decision to grow or not,” she says. “Will you be a leader who is always ready to face the next challenge? Or will you be a leader who tries to apply yesterday's solutions to today's problems?” As Blake confronts the challenges of business in the real world, he turns to Debbie for guidance. Step by step, Debbie and Blake explore the GROW model—four ways that leaders must challenge and stretch themselves, both on the job and off, to fulfill their highest potential. Whether you're a CEO or an entry-level employee, this book will inspire you to reflect on your life and design your own long-term growth plan—a plan that can lead not only to continuing professional success but to personal fulfillment as well.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781292063393","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Mastering Services Pricing","authors":["Kevin Doolan"],"pages":"320","publication_date":"August 2015","description":"The definitive guide on how to price services to deliver profit, fund for product development and meet the needs of the customer/client at a price they are happy to pay.\n\n \n\nAs traditional manufacturing companies move to service provision, what pricing model should they develop and what buyer behaviour model should they nurture?

Not only does this not build trust, it also does not hold managers responsible for coaching people and helping them win. The manager’s responsibility is focused on sorting people out.\n\nWhen I was a college professor, I always gave my students the final exam at the beginning of the course and spent the rest of the semester helping them answer the questions so that they could get an A. Life is all about getting As, not some stupid normal distribution curve. Garry Ridge got this, and wow! What a difference it has made in WD-40 Company’s performance.”\n\n--Ken Blanchard\n\n“When I first heard Ken talk about giving his final exam at the beginning of the course and then teaching students the answers so they could get an A, it blew me away. Why don’t we do that in business? So that’s exactly what I did at WD-40 Company when we set up our ‘Don’t Mark My Paper, Help Me Get an A’ performance management system. Has it made a difference?

The increasing need for natural resources has raised concerns regarding issues such as resource scarcity, undesirable environmental impacts due to material extraction, primary production, and suboptimal product disposal, and social or political tensions. Product End-of-Life (EoL) options, such as reusing or recycling, attempt to limit or reduce the amount of waste sent to a landfill, providing strategic means to decouple the link between economic growth and resource usage. These EoL options have the potential to close material loops, further utilizing wastes as resources, reducing environmental impacts, conserving natural resources, reducing material prices, and providing job opportunities in developing countries.Remanufacturing, on the other hand, is a unique EoL option due to increasing the number of life cycles of a product before final disposal. First, recurring environmental benefits, such as emission and raw material extraction avoidance are obtained with each additional product life cycle. Second, individual resource efficiency yields increase through product remanufacture. Resource efficiency or, using more with less will continue to compound with each additional life cycle. Third, recirculating products decreases the demand and dependency for primary resource production, further closing the material loop and creating a more circular economy. In addition, remanufacturing can initiate more preferable EoL options such as recovery, recycling, and waste reduction.\n\nWhile remanufacturing offers numerous benefits, there is significant lack of literature and books covering the fundamentals of operations, technologies and business models. The proposed book will provide in-depth coverage of remanufacturing fundamentals and its strong link to circular economy and resource efficiency.","tags":["Business","Operations","Green Business Practices"]},{"id":"9780814474167","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Emotional Intelligence for Project Managers: The People Skills You Need to Achieve Outstanding Results","authors":["Anthony C.

Implementation and Management of Performance Improvement Plans begins in the middle – in the implementation phase of performance improvement plans rather than the design or planning phases. This is because, according to the author, implementation is where something useful happens ... or doesn't. Performance improvement aimed at individuals and groups is different. Here you'll learn about common basic misconceptions and errors other leaders make when shifting focus from individual to group and how not to go down the same road. Covered in this cutting-edge resource are six key topic areas: How to approach improvement in a systematic way and \"do it right\"; How to bring the entire organization into an alignment that adds value over time and keep it there; How project management stitches everything together – from planning through implementation to value added; How to ensure every group being targeted by the plan is fully aware of what is intended and how it applies to them; How to achieve the \"holy grail\" of performance improvement – measurable improvements and the measurable increase of commitment.","tags":["Business","Project & Product Management","Project Management"]},{"id":"0814406637","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Project Management Office Toolkit","authors":["Jolyon E.

More specifically, the book deals with the plurality of the sciences and technologies. It is about the way in which each of them develops around the prosthetics of printed languages and the models used as visual aids to help us create new modes of communication to understand and solve human problems. Consequently, the task is to simplify the complexity that we find in different sciences, both social and physical. In his collection of essays, George E. Yoos surveys a number of different models that have evolved from the innate, biological forms of grammar, logic, and modes of orientation. He investigates the evolution of socially constructed systems of numeracy and measurement that have evolved and developed in different languages for the use in scientific and technological communication. He identifies methods derived from three distinct personal experiences: the use of types of prosthetic, mnemonic, and attention controlling devices, in order to yield simpler perspectives of complex states of affairs. George E. Yoos, emeritus professor, is a legend in the field of rhetoric.

We have an idea of what might work and we try it out. If that doesn't work, we try something else. And so on. It's inefficient at best, and with really hard problems there are simply too many variables for guessing to work. Greene shows you how to adopt the behaviors great problem solvers use to arrive at solutions efficiently—without guessing.

The latter is characterized by the combination of three main phenomena: internationalization, digitalization and hyper-personalization that refound the employment relationship between employers, unions and employees. Internationalization requires a renewal of business models heckled by the low-cost strategies of new operators provoking social reactions to the extent of perceived psychological disruptions, to question the validity of these same strategies. Digitization has opened the way to the disintermediation at the origin of the evolution of the trades front and back office. Finally, hyper-personalization and adaptation to new client behaviors justify the hegemony of soft skills for a redefined hospitality. In the end, the employee must constantly deal with often paradoxical injunctions (example: standardization of service protocols versus empowerment). A focus will be made on two specific branches: hotels and air transport which will each be part of a part. The topic will be illustrated by case studies and testimonials. The two coordinators of the book will draw on the contributions of researchers who collaborate with them in the framework of an international research program they pilot.","tags":["Business","Human Resources"]},{"id":"9780137044818","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"The ETF Trend Following Playbook: Profiting from Trends in Bull or Bear Markets with Exchange Traded Funds","authors":["Tom Lydon"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"August 2009","description":"Master the Low-Risk ETF-Based Investing Strategy That Gives You the Chance to Make Money in Any Market Climate\n\n“Tom Lydon has been a leader in the ETF business for many years.

When everything external to us is moving so quickly, we feel out of control and exhausted; we worry about what we don’t have or what we need more of; we seek solutions to band-aid our perceived imperfections and doubts. Crowded calendars and unending demands at home and work give us little time to look internally — though it is within each of us where the answers can be found.\n\nAt a time when we suffer from unprecedented stress, comparison-itis and self-doubt, author Janine Garner asks us to slow down and turn our focus inward.

Yet some CEOs deliver their greatest successes when times get toughestwhen customers’ preferences are shifting away from a company’s products, when new regulations are shrinking profit margins, when political unrest is destroying supply lines.In Better Under Pressure, Justin Menkes reveals the common traits that make these leaders successful. Drawing on in-depth interviews with sixty CEOs from an array of industries and performance data from two hundred other leaders, Menkes shows that great executives strive relentlessly to maximize their own potentialas well as stoke their people’s innate thirst for their own triumphs. To do so, they draw on a set of three essential and rare attributes: Realistic optimism: They recognize the risks threatening their organization’s survivaland their own failingswhile remaining confident in their ability to have an impact. Subservience to purpose: They dedicate themselves to pursuing a noble cause and win their team’s commitment to that cause. Finding order in chaos: They find clarity amid the many variables affecting their business by culling data and forming the conclusions that matter most to the company.The good news: these three capabilities can be learned. Drawing on a broad range of examples from real companiesincluding Avon, Yum Brands, Southwest, Procter & Gamble, and Ryerson Steel, to name just a fewMenkes demonstrates how each psychological attribute manifests itself in real life and enables top performance under extreme duress. He also shows you how to develop and deploy those attributesso you can transform yourself into a leader who only shines brighter as the pressure intensifies.Deeply personal, brimming with compelling stories from real-life CEOs, and packed with powerful insights, tools, and practices, this book is a potent resource for aspiring, emerging, and seasoned business leaders alike.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781449632618","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Business of Sports, 2nd Edition","authors":["Scott Rosner","Kenneth L.

A World Gone Social offers an eye-opening look at fundamental and powerful changes the social collaboration era has set in motion: ● Customers now have the power--just watch what happens as more realize it! ● With increased transparency, businesses must be more ethical--no more pretending ● Command-and-control leadership is now so inefficient, it is a liability ● Nimble and small is the new competitive advantage--few corporations are capable of the agility required by evolving marketplaces ● Recruiting is now a two-way proposition, with job seekers able to peer behind the corporate curtain ● Relationship and community-building is how customers and brand ambassadors are won--and retained ● Engagement--with partners, employees, and customers--is not a luxury; it is a requirement. Each chapter provides compelling stories and concrete examples of companies demonstrating enlightened business practices and doing Social right--and some that are not--and the lessons to be learned from their experiences.

All too often, subordinates spin the truth for those above while bosses fail to establish the conditions required for subordinates to tell it to them straight. The end result is warped communication, corrupt internal politics, illusionary teamwork, pass-the-buck accountability, and personal dispiriting-and the company is always the big loser.Don't Kill the Bosses! reveals the \"trap\" created when people fail to differentiate between the positives of hierarchical structure and the negatives of hierarchical relationships. Far from being opposed to hierarchy, the authors believe strongly that an accurate and cleanly defined organization chart is vital. But they show how to implement an alternative model of hierarchy: two-sided accountability. Drawing on case studies from their consulting practice, Culbert and Ullmen show how this new model leads to a freer flow of information, more creative problem-solving, and quicker response to changing conditions.Unlike other books that acknowledge boss/subordinate relationships as a systematic, continuing problem and offer skill development suggestions for dealing with it, Don't Kill the Bosses! tells how to think about the problem in a way that will enable readers to understand the steps they need to take to change things. It diagnoses what's missing in boss/subordinate relationships, connects what's wrong with them to personal and organizational outcomes, and defines the whole new mentality required to make them work successfully.","tags":["Business","Operations","Process Management"]},{"id":"9781118936511","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"The Voice of the Rising Generation","authors":["James E.

What should you ask? Whom should you ask? When? Is it ever right to talk about such things?\n\nThe Voice of the Rising Generation speaks directly to those who find themselves living in that silence, the so-called \"next generation.\" Great wealth or a family business can act like a \"black hole,\" sapping the dreams and aspirations of future generations who feel that they can never measure up to the fortune's founder. This book, written by a psychologist, an educator, and a wise counselor who single-handedly changed the landscape of family wealth, diagnoses with economy and precision the cause of entitlement and dependency. It is not too much money or too few chores. It is the failure of rising generations to individuate, that is, to pursue their dreams, develop their resilience, and find their voice.\n\nMany books are addressed to parents and grandparents who worry about the effects of wealth on their descendants. Almost alone in the field, this book speaks directly to 20-, 30- and 40-somethings, encouraging them—literally, giving them courage—to meet the challenge of integrating wealth's power into their lives, rather than disappearing into the black hole. Readers will:\n\nCome to understand the true causes of entitlement and dependency\nIdentify the psychological characteristics of the rising generation and the challenges proper to its development\nClarify their own dreams, work, and vocation\nNavigate personal relationships and communication within the context of wealth\nRecognize the special challenges faced when rising is delayed until mid-life.\n\nIf you are a young person who is starting your life's journey and wondering about the effects of parental gifts, trusts, or a family business, this book will offer you questions, reflections, and lessons-learned to help you find your own way. If you are a parent, grandparent, elder, or mentor, The Voice of the Rising Generation can serve the young people in your life as a gift more precious than gold.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Development"]},{"id":"9781119968948","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"QuickBooks® 2012 For Dummies®, UK Edition","authors":["Stephen L.

But companies have been dealing with an exponentially increasing amount of data, and much of it in forms that are impossible to manage by traditional analytics. “Big data” includes information such as call center voice data, social media content and video entertainment, as well as clickstream data from the web.\n\nThe authors posit that organizations that are learning to take advantage of big data are beginning to understand their business environments at a more granular level, are creating new products and services, and are responding more quickly to change as it occurs. These companies stand apart from those with traditional data analysis environments in three critical ways.\n\nFirst, rather than looking at data to assess what happened in the past, these organizations consider data in terms of flows and processes, and make decisions and take actions quickly. In addition, organizations already involved with big data are taking a lead on hiring — and training — data scientists and product and process developers as opposed to data analysts. And finally, advanced organizations are moving analytics from IT into their core business and operational functions. As big data evolves, a new information ecosystem is also evolving, a network that is continuously sharing information, optimizing decisions, communicating results and generating new insights for businesses.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Digital Transformation"]},{"id":"9780132478779","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Japan: A Cautionary Tale","authors":["Vinh Q.

This unique book is the first of its kind in dealing with challenges these financial institutions face in the absence of interest rate mechanism and debt-based financial instruments. The book examines critically issues involve in managing the risk of liquidity management for these types of institutions, including those stemming from Basel requirements. It then offers an alternative regulatory framework more appropriately suited for such banks without compromising safety and security. The book's unique features and innovative dimensions diagnostically differentiate between Islamic banks and conventional banks as related to liquidity management risks. It proposes a risk-sharing regulatory framework that, once implemented, would mitigate risks posed by balance-sheet mismatches.

The CEO and executive team are almost always highly compensated and the relative total compensation has mushroomed over time. Most of the compensation now is designed to be performance-based, but leading to charges that executives have incentives to manipulate corporate earnings and stock price in the short-term for their own self interests. The compensation at some companies became so egregious that compensation again became a major public policy issue subject to federal regulation. Executive Compensation focuses on the major topics related to executive compensation—present, past, and future. First, is understanding what executive compensation is, including composition and objectives of pay contracts. Second, how do specific compensation agreements affect corporate behavior and performance? Third, what are the major components, including how and what are accounted for and disclosed? How is compensation, especially executive compensation, accounted for—that is, what are the calculations and journal entries required? Fourth, what does historical analysis tell us about the topic, especially how contractual decisions have been made and what has worked. Finally, what is in store for the future—both expected compensation agreements and what the compensation incentives suggest for future corporate decisions on operations and accounting manipulation.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Business Ethics"]},{"id":"9781606496640","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Public Relations Firm","authors":["Stacy Smith"],"pages":"111","publication_date":"January 2015","description":"The Public Relations Firm takes an in-depth look at the client/agency relationship by discussing what business leaders should expect of their public relations firms.

Something was standing in their way—usually the unwillingness or inability to make a critical decision. They thought they needed more—more education, more experience, more time, or more data. They had enough of these, but they lacked the confidence, courage, and optimism to make the tough calls. Through our work together, we learned that when leaders make good decisions, little else matters. When they refuse to make decisions, or show a pattern of making bad ones, nothing else matters. The most successful leaders realized they could no longer push growth. Instead, they had to remove barriers to success—obstacles they had erected themselves. The compelling stories and surprising research findings in this book focus on real people who actively sought professional improvement and personal development. Working together, we mapped out their journeys, identified roadblocks, recognized the wrong turns they had taken, and unlocked their decision-making potential—in some cases, more than doubling the size of their companies. Most of these stories illustrate how and why these leaders succeed, but others serve as warnings about what can happen when leaders refuse to decide.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management"]},{"id":"9781606496244","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Intercultural Communication for Managers","authors":["Michael B.

Driven by multinational companies, public–private partnerships and social enterprises, “innovation for development” aims to co-produce social goods (things of value) such as poverty alleviation with associated profit through innovative market-led solutions, opening up untapped and unserved markets in the developing world and exploiting the potential “fortune at the bottom of the pyramid”. But innovation for development is a contested notion with the capacity to shelter multiple political agendas. By reviewing existing academic theory and discussing four in-depth case studies from Bangladesh and India, this book interrogates how innovation for development is being framed, its politics and the impacts it is having on rural communities on the ground. The analysis suggests both an emerging hegemony constructed around a neoliberal, market-led agenda and the existence of countervailing voices that question this framing, sometimes radically so.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Innovation"]},{"id":"9780134589015","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"My Facebook® for Seniors, Third Edition","authors":["Michael Miller"],"pages":"304","publication_date":"August 2016","description":"The perfect book to help anyone 50+ learn Facebook--in full color!

Seventy-seven percent of leaders think they do a good job of engaging their people, yet 88 percent of employees say their leaders don't engage enough. There is also a high level of suffering in the workplace: 35 percent of employees would forgo a pay raise to see their leaders fired.\n\nThis is an enormous waste of human talent--despite the fact that $46 billion is spent each year on leadership development.\n\nBased on extensive research, including assessments of more than 35,000 leaders and interviews with 250 C-level executives, The Mind of the Leader concludes that organizations and leaders aren't meeting employees' basic human needs of finding meaning, purpose, connection, and genuine happiness in their work.\n\nBut more than a description of the problem, The Mind of the Leader offers a radical, yet practical, solution. To solve the leadership crisis, organizations need to put people at the center of their strategy. They need to develop managers and executives who lead with three core mental qualities: mindfulness, selflessness, and compassion.\n\nUsing real-world inspirational examples from Marriott, Accenture, McKinsey & Company, LinkedIn, and many more, The Mind of the Leader shows how this new kind of leadership turns conventional leadership thinking upside down. It represents a radical redefinition of what it takes to be an effective leader--and a practical, hard-nosed solution to every organization's engagement and execution problems.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9780240808314","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Hands-On Guide to Video Blogging and Podcasting","authors":["Lionel Felix","Damien Stolarz"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"May 2013","description":"For all of your video and audio blogging business and professional communication needs, this book is it!\n\nThe Hands-on Guide to Video Blogging and Podcasting provides tremendous value to those content publishers, big and small, that want to create syndicated video blog and podcast content.

Along the way, he also discusses sectors pioneering especially intense IT usage, notably financial services, where 92% of business costs now relate to data.

Today's professionals feel rushed, overwhelmed, and perennially behind. So we keep our heads down, focused on the next thing, and the next, without a moment to breathe.\n\nHow can we break out of this endless cycle and create the kind of interesting, meaningful lives we all seek?\n\nJust as CEOs who optimize for quarterly profits often fail to make the strategic investments necessary for long-term growth, the same is true in our own personal and professional lives. We need to reorient ourselves to see the big picture so we can tap into the power of small changes that, made today, will have an enormous and disproportionate impact on our future success. We need to start playing The Long Game.\n\nAs top business thinker and Duke University professor Dorie Clark explains, we all know intellectually that lasting success takes persistence and effort. And yet so much of the relentless pressure in our culture pushes us toward doing what's easy, what's guaranteed, or what looks glamorous in the moment. In The Long Game, she argues for a different path. It's about doing small things over time to achieve our goals—and being willing to keep at them, even when they seem pointless, boring, or hard.\n\nIn The Long Game, Clark shares unique principles and frameworks you can apply to your specific situation, as well as vivid stories from her own career and other professionals' experiences. Everyone is allotted the same twenty-four hours—but with the right strategies, you can leverage those hours in more efficient and powerful ways than you ever imagined.

In order to sustain profitability, these companies are looking to reduce waste (of all kinds), improve efficiency and increase productivity. Many of them are taking a closer look at lean manufacturing as a way to achieve these goals. Lean biomanufacturing re-visits lean principles and then applies them sympathetically - in a highly practical approach - to the specific needs of pharmaceutical processes, which present significantly different challenges to more mainstream manufacturing processes. A major goal of the book is to highlight those problems and issues that appear more specific or unique to biopharmaceutical manufacturing situations and to provide some insights into what challenges are the important ones to solve and what techniques, tools and mechanisms to employ to be successful.Following an introduction to lean biomanufacturing, the book goes on to discuss lean technologies and methods applied in biomanufacturing. Later chapters cover the creation and implementation of the Transition Plan, issues facing the biopharmaceutical industry, creating a lean approach towards biopharmaceutical processes and the contribution of simulation models in developing these processes. The final chapter covers examples of new technology innovations which help facilitate lean biomanufacturing.\nA focus on the issues associated with the application of lean principles to biomanufacturing\nPractical examples of factors which can affect biopharmaceutical processes\nCoverage of key factors which require integration to run an efficient biopharmaceutical process","tags":["Business","Project & Product Management","Product Management","Lean"]},{"id":"9780749456771","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Test Your IQ, 2nd Edition","authors":["Philip Carter","Ken Russell"],"pages":"176","publication_date":"September 2009","description":"Test Your IQ contains 400 IQ test questions written and compiled by IQ-test experts, complete with a guide to assessing individual performance which will help to improve vocabulary and develop powers of calculation and logical reasoning.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Career Development","Reasoning Tests"]},{"id":"9780749466923","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Leadership Transitions","authors":["Richard Elsner","Bridget Farrands"],"pages":"208","publication_date":"September 2012","description":"Leadership Transitions offers a unique and practical series of tools and advice for coping with leadership change, both from the individual's and organisation's perspective, and creating a pathway to management success.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Change Management"]},{"id":"9780749466985","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Develop Your Assertiveness, 3rd Edition","authors":["Sue Bishop"],"pages":"168","publication_date":"March 2013","description":"Develop Your Assertiveness is an easy to follow guide with a range of self-assessment tools and exercises that will help you become more confident.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Development","Confidence / Motivation"]},{"id":"9780749461959","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"IQ and Aptitude Tests","authors":["Philip Carter"],"pages":"168","publication_date":"December 2010","description":"IQ and Aptitude Tests contains hundreds of practice questions which will enable readers to assess and improve their performance in IQ, numerical aptitude and verbal aptitude tests.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Career Development","Reasoning Tests"]},{"id":"53863MIT57106","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Creating Effective Dialogue About Corporate Social Responsibility","authors":["Laura Illia","Stelios Zyglidopoulos","Stefania Romenti"],"pages":"3","publication_date":"October 2015","description":"Corporate social responsibility initiatives run the risk of being seen as insincere.

Human beingsalso have a tendency to think and act hierarchically. In fact, hierarchies — distinct differences in groupmembers' power and status — can be found in virtually every human group, from children on the playground to executives in the boardroom. Although many people have argued that flat organizationspromote innovative thinking, the authors maintain that a properly deployed hierarchy can help teamsengage in and get the most out of their efforts to learn and innovate.Specifically, the authors observe that hierarchies help teams generate, identify, and select new ideasby performing three critical functions: bounding solutions, converging ideas, and structuring processes.\"A paradox of creativity,\" the authors write, \"is that people are more innovative when they have clearconstraints (such as time, budget, customer requirements, etc.) within which their solutions must fit.\"Early on, teams tend to come up with an array of ideas and possibilities. Hierarchies, the authorsexplain, can help sort through which ideas should be pursued and which ones are less promising.The authors provide three recommendations for leaders seeking to leverage the power of hierarchyon teams and avoid its pitfalls. First, organizations should have a clear chain of command. In one study,teams with a clear chain of command were less likely to get bogged down in conflicts and stalematesthan other teams.Second, organizations need to create performance-based cultures in which performance gets measured,publicized, and celebrated. Hierarchies in performance-based cultures are more likely to be basedon expertise, and that can counteract unconscious biases against women and minorities.Third, people at the top of the organization should act in ways that support group goals as opposedto promoting their own interests. Citing a study one of the authors participated in, they write:\"Hierarchies promoted learning and performance when goals and feedback were group-oriented, butthey stifled learning and performance when goals and feedback were individually oriented.\"","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Strategic Thinking"]},{"id":"9781604912142","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Leadership in Action: Issues and Observastions—The Luxury of Tough Times: Five Terrific Questions","authors":["Keir Carroll"],"pages":"4","publication_date":"June 2009","description":"Tough times can boot us out of the blender and into the helicopter.

At home, they often face an unequal division of household chores and childcare, and in the workplace, they deal with lower pay, lack of credit for their contributions, roadblocks to promotion, sexual harassment, and more. And while organizations are looking to address these issues, too many gender-inclusion initiatives focus on how women themselves should respond, reinforcing the perception that these are \"women's issues\" and that men—often the most influential stakeholders in an organization—don't need to be involved.\n\nGender-in-the-workplace experts David G. Smith and W. Brad Johnson counter this perception. In this important book, they show that men have a crucial role to play in promoting gender equality at work. Research shows that when men are deliberately engaged in gender-inclusion programs, 96 percent of women in those organizations perceive real progress in gender equality, compared with only 30 percent of women in organizations without strong male engagement.\n\nGood Guys is the first practical, research-based guide for how to be a male ally to women in the workplace. Filled with firsthand accounts from both men and women, and tips for getting started, the book shows how men can partner with their female colleagues to advance women's leadership and equality by breaking ingrained gender stereotypes, overcoming unconscious biases, developing and supporting the talented women around them, and creating productive and respectful working relationships with women.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Culture in Business"]},{"id":"9781422133385","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Innovation Tournaments","authors":["Christian Terwiesch","Karl Ulrich"],"pages":"256","publication_date":"June 2009","description":"Managers, entrepreneurs, and venture capitalists all seek to maximize the financial returns from innovation, and profits are driven largely by the quality of the opportunities they pursue.

Those who possess it are generally luckier in love, more likely to be popular, and more apt to get better grades in school. But very few of us realize just how much looks affect every aspect of our lives. Recent studies document that people blessed with good looks earn about 10% more than their average-looking colleagues. They are also more likely to get hired and promoted at work. What exactly is this \"physical attractiveness\" phenomenon and how does it affect each and every one of us?\n\nDr. Gordon L. Patzer has devoted the last 30 years to investigating this unsettling phenomenon for both women and men, and how it touches every part of our lives. In Looks, he reveals not only its impact on romance, but also on family dynamics, performance in school, career, courtroom proceedings, politics and government. Looks is the first book to explore how the power of beauty affects both sexes and how the rise of reality TV shows, cosmetic surgery, and celebrity culture have contributed to our culture’s overall obsession with being beautiful.\n\nUnflinching and topical, Looks uncovers the sometimes ugly truth about beauty and its profound effects on all our lives.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Development","Confidence / Motivation"]},{"id":"9780132478328","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"The Truth About Taxes and Your Home","authors":["S.

It’s not that companies refrain from investing in developing their people: In 2012, companies in developed economies spent nearly $400 billion on training. But, as authors Shlomo Ben-Hur, Bernard Jaworski, and David Gray argue, much of the investment and effort that organizations spend on learning is focused on the wrong things. Instead of focusing on new modes of instruction and technology, they write, corporate learning executives need to emphasize aligning learning programs with business strategy.\n\nAlthough learning executives such as chief learning officers must shoulder the burden of developing the company’s talent capabilities and supporting strategic priorities, the authors argue that CEOs and other top executives have a critical role to play. Personal engagement and leadership on the part of the CEO can make a big difference in setting the right tone for the organization.\n\nWhile companies often begin with training-needs assessments, the authors recommend starting by mapping what they call the “CEO agenda” to ensure that learning gets properly aligned with strategy. This connects learning and development with the company’s specific needs and cuts through the noise of multiple initiatives vying for attention — highlighting the critical “must-win battles” that the CEO has identified.\n\nThe next task is to operationalize the learning agenda through a portfolio of learning and development activities. This involves doing an inventory of existing learning and development resources. Companies should repeat this on a regular basis, the authors say, to ensure that the activities in place reflect the company’s learning strategy. Companies should be wary about making wholesale changes to learning portfolios and organizational structures, the authors warn, unless there are major shifts in the company’s mission or business context. Reorganizations “should be limited to situations where they are warranted — for example, when the learning agenda is misaligned with corporate strategy or the strategy changes.”\n\nLike the CEO agenda, the company’s learning agenda should articulate the essential strategic initiatives for corporate learning. Choices about what to include or eliminate to bring learning activities in line with current priorities should not be made in isolation, and the authors say it’s important to get input and buy-in from both the learning organization and business leaders — all the way to the CEO level.\n\nAlthough the CEO’s personal involvement is valuable, a broader effort of stakeholder management is typically required to promote and gain buy-in for the learning agenda. Learning leaders should map out a concerted “campaign” to inform and gather input from key influencers and decision makers in other parts of the business. A disciplined effort of stakeholder engagement and outreach gives learning leaders an opportunity to deepen their understanding of strategic priorities and demonstrate the business value of learning interventions.\n\nCompanies with successful learning programs like Shell and Capgemini invite leaders from various business units to help steer curriculum. Such advisory structures help ensure that local learning activities remain aligned with the company’s learning agenda and that corporate learning leaders adapt to the changing needs of different parts of the business.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy"]},{"id":"53863MIT54216","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Benefits of Sustainability-Driven Innovation","authors":["Eugene Goh","Martin Reeves","Nina Kruschwitz"],"pages":"5","publication_date":"January 2013","description":"Results from the fourth year of MIT Sloan Management Review’s research collaboration with the Boston Consulting Group have found that managers who say sustainability has caused their organization to change its business model are also more likely to say that the organization’s sustainability activities have added to profits. Respondents to the survey who not only changed their business model because of sustainability but also generated profits from their sustainability-related activities and decisions — “Sustainability-Driven Innovators” — represented 23% of the survey pool.The survey results suggest that business model change, top management support, collaboration with customers and having a business case are associated with creating economic value from sustainability activities and decisions. Ninety percent of all managers who said their companies have all these characteristics also say that their sustainability activities add to their profits.The authors’ research suggests several ways in which companies can become more effective at connecting business model change with sustainability-based profits. Based on the behavior of Sustainability-Driven Innovators, they make three recommendations for how managers can improve their odds of profiting from their sustainability activities.First is to be prepared to change the business model, which may involve extensive corporate change, require significant top management attention and entail setting multiyear goals. Second is to learn how your customers think about sustainability and understand what they are willing to pay for in connection with sustainable products or services. The final recommendation involves increasing collaboration both internally and externally with customers, businesses and groups beyond the boundaries of the organization to improve operations and competitive advantage.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Innovation"]},{"id":"53863MIT56307","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"How Executive Sponsors Influence Project Success","authors":["Debbie Tesch","Timothy J. Kloppenborg"],"pages":"4","publication_date":"April 2015","description":"To improve the chances that projects will be successful, organizations often choose senior executiveswith an interest in the outcome to act as the project sponsors. Executive sponsors are responsible forlining up the necessary resources at the beginning, managing certain activities while the project is underway, and ultimately delivering results. Since sponsors rarely have enough time to manage projects personally, they must rely heavily on project managers. So which activities and behaviors can busy sponsors perform in the course of a project to increase the chances of project success?In researching what makes for successful project sponsorship, the authors used a project life cyclemodel with four stages: (1) initiating — from the preliminary idea through approved charter; (2) planning— from approved charter through approved project plan; (3) executing — from approved projectplan through acceptance of major deliverables; and (4) closing — from acceptance of major deliverablesthrough final completion.Project success historically has been defined by the “iron triangle” of cost, schedule and performance.The authors use a broader definition based on three success factors. The first success factor involvesimpact on the project’s customers, which is almost always the most important success measure. Thesecond success factor involves meeting agreements: Was the project completed on time, on budget andto specifications? The third success factor is tied to the future benefits to the company, be they newtechnology, new products, new markets and/or commercial success.The authors conducted separate studies of each project life-cycle stage, using literature reviews, focusgroups, surveys and factor analysis in order to examine sponsor behavior and project success factors.For each stage, they found that two or three behaviors had a significant impact on the project successfactors. In the initiating stage, the important behaviors for executive sponsors involve setting performance goals for the project, selecting and mentoring the project manager and establishing priorities. In the project’s planning stage, the key sponsor behaviors are ensuring planning and developing relationships with stakeholders. While the project is being executed, important roles for executive sponsors involve ensuring adequate and effective communication, maintaining relationships with stakeholders and ensuring quality. In the project’s closing stage, identifying and capturing lessons learned and ensuring that capabilities and benefits are realized are critical sponsor activities.","tags":["Business","Project & Product Management","Project Management"]},{"id":"53863MIT54323","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"How Much Does A Company’s Reputation Matter in Recruiting?","authors":["Esra Alniacik","Naomi A.

With the country’s general elections in 2014 resulting in a government formed by a new political party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, led by a business-friendly prime minister, Narendra Kumar Modi, the world’s largest democracy is once again on the minds of business leaders the world over. The renewal of interest in India is all the greater because of what’s happening in neighboring China. For over thirty years, China was the growth engine for many Western multinational companies, but the combination of a slowing economy, rising wages, and increasing political risk has most companies looking for the next China. No other country is better positioned to play that role than India. In the short term, though, India will remain a challenging market, with a well-deserved reputation for corruption, uncertainty, and stultifying bureaucracy. Those hurdles are unlikely to go away soon. Yet India may be on the verge of unprecedented growth. Can you afford to wait or should you plunge into this complex market today? What does it really take to win there? How do executives deal with India’s volatility, uncertainty, and intense competitionand even prosper from it? Ravi Venkatesan, the former Chairman of Microsoft India and Cummins India, offers expert advice on how your company can overcome the unique challenges of the Indian market. He argues that India is in fact an archetype for most developing nations, many of which present similar challenges. Succeeding in India is important not just because it is a big market but also because it is a litmus test for your corporation’s ability to succeed in other emerging markets. If you can win in India, you should be able to win anywhere. Hard as these frontier markets are, Venkatesan argues, the bigger hurdle may well be the internal culture and mind-set at a multinational’s headquarters. The unwillingness to make a long-term commitment or to adequately trust local leadership, combined with the propensity to rigidly replicate the products, business models, and operating systems that have worked at home, drives many companies into a midway trap.” That often results in India remaining an irrelevantly small contributor to the company’s global growth and profits. Combining personal experience and in-depth interviews with CEOs and senior leaders at dozens of companiesincluding Microsoft, GE, JCB, Dell, Honeywell, Volvo, Bosch, Deere, Unilever, and NestléVenkatesan shows you how to tackle political changes, policy uncertainty, and corruption and thrive in India. He proves that you can break through, but it takes a very different type of leadership, both locally and at corporate headquarters. If you want to succeed in the twenty-first century, you must succeed in emerging markets. This practical book, written by one of India’s most respected CEOs, gives you the keys to win in India, other emerging markets, and, indeed, globally.","tags":["Business","Economics","Next Economy"]},{"id":"9780137157860","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Agents of Change: Managing the Introduction of Automated Tools","authors":["Barbara M.

They did so for good reasons: the sometimes astonishing returns they've delivered to their investors and the astonishingly large companies that their ecosystem has created.\n\nBut the vast majority of fast-growing companies never take any venture capital. So where does the money come from to start and grow their companies? From a much more agreeable and hospitable source, their customers. That's exactly what Michael Dell, Bill Gates and Banana Republic's Mel and Patricia Ziegler did to get their companies up and running and turn them into iconic brands.\n\nIn The Customer Funded Business, best-selling author John Mullins uncovers five novel approaches that scrappy and innovative 21st century entrepreneurs working in companies large and small have ingeniously adapted from their predecessors like Dell, Gates, and the Zieglers:\n\nMatchmaker models (Airbnb)\n\nPay-in-advance models (Threadless)\n\nSubscription models (TutorVista)\n\nScarcity models (Vente Privee)\n\nService-to-product models (GoViral)\n\nThrough the captivating stories of these and other inspiring companies from around the world, Mullins brings to life the five models and identifies the questions that angel or other investors will - and should! - ask of entrepreneurs or corporate innovators seeking to apply them. Drawing on in-depth interviews with entrepreneurs and investors who have actually put these models to use, Mullins goes on to address the key implementation issues that characterize each of the models: when to apply them, how best to apply them, and the pitfalls to watch out for.\n\nWhether you're an aspiring entrepreneur lacking the start-up capital you need, an early-stage entrepreneur trying to get your cash-starved venture into take-off mode, an intrapreneur seeking funding within an established company, or an angel investor or mentor who supports high-potential ventures, this book offers the most sure-footed path to starting, financing, or growing your venture.\n\nJohn Mullins is the author of The New Business Road Test and, with Randy Komisar, the widely acclaimed Getting to Plan B.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Entrepreneurship"]},{"id":"9780470525678","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"iPod® and iTunes® for Dummies®, 7th Edition","authors":["Tony Bove"],"pages":"408","publication_date":"October 2009","description":"The fun and easy way to make the most of your iPod and the iTunes store\n\niPods have totally revolutionized the way we play music, videos, and TV shows.

Legacy companies, we hear, are all doomed to fail unless they double down on the latest digital innovations, and disruptors are ordained to take over the world. Digital innovation is the answer to everything. False! Nothing in life or business is ever that simple. In The Brains and Brawn Company: How Leading Organizations Blend the Best of Digital and Physical, venture capitalist and Stanford Business School lecturer Robert Siegel brings the digital innovation conversation back down to earth. He shows that, while important, digital is only part of the answer―and it’s never the only answer. The vast majority of successful leaders from both incumbents and disruptors focus as much on things like logistics, manufacturing, and distribution as they do on digital innovation. In fact, many established companies are successfully countering young upstarts in other creative ways, and many new organizations are learning from their older brethren. Siegel shows how to create lasting profits and growth in the smartest way possible: by creating a solid partnership between digital innovation and traditional business operations—in other words, by marrying brains and brawn. He lays out the core competencies that today’s industry leaders have mastered and explains how:\nCharles Schwab uses cutting-edge analytics to better serve millions of investors without violating its original code of values.\nAlign Technology transformed orthodontia by developing creative new business models along with new products.\nKaiser Permanente taps into the power of empathy to improve patient satisfaction while controlling costs.\nInstacart balances ownership and partnerships to balance the needs of four key constituencies.\nTarget, Best Buy, and Home Depot found different ways to blend the best aspects of physical retail with innovative e-commerce.\nDesktop Metal is innovating high-volume yet affordable production methods that can revolutionize manufacturing.\nFilled with original research and case studies of Daimler, 23andMe, Instacart, AB InBev, Google, and many other companies, The Brains and Brawn Company: How Leading Organizations Blend the Best of Digital and Physical provides practical, proven insights and advice for bridging the gulf between digital vs. physical, disruptor vs. incumbent, startup world vs. Fortune 500, and tech culture vs. industrial culture. The Brains and Brawn Company: How Leading Organizations Blend the Best of Digital and Physical provides everything you need to set your company apart from your competitors in real and measurable ways—and take the lead in your industry for years to come.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Digital Transformation"]},{"id":"9780132311731","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"What Would Ben Graham Do Now?: A New Value Investing Playbook for a Global Age","authors":["Jeffrey Towson"],"pages":"320","publication_date":"May 2011","description":"As originally conceived by the legendary Benjamin Graham, traditional value investing involves purchasing relatively stable stocks and companies at a percentage below their intrinsic value.

Next, he shows how to invest for the next twenty years—successfully navigating the titanic market collisions that will batter investors who aren’t prepared for them.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Personal Finance"]},{"id":"0321426223","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Secrets of RSS","authors":["Steven Holzner"],"pages":"344","publication_date":"June 2006","description":"Whether you want to create your own RSS feeds or just would like to locate and add them to your Web site, this is the book for you.

It’s clear that in today’s era of fiscal constraints and political gridlock, we can no longer turn to government alone to tackle these and other towering social problems. What’s required is a new, more collaborative and productive economic system. The Solution Revolution brings hoperevealing just such a burgeoning new economy where players from across the spectrum of business, government, philanthropy, and social enterprise converge to solve big problems and create public value.By erasing public-private sector boundaries, the solution economy is unlocking trillions of dollars in social benefit and commercial value. Where tough societal problems persist, new problem solvers are crowdfunding, ridesharing, app-developing, or impact-investing to design innovative new solutions for seemingly intractable problems. Providing low-cost health care, fighting poverty, creating renewable energy, and preventing obesity are just a few of the tough challenges that also represent tremendous opportunities for those at the vanguard of this movement. They create markets for social good and trade solutions instead of dollars to fill the gap between what government can provide and what citizens need.So what drives the solution economy? Who are these new players and how are their roles changing? How can we grow the movement? And how can we participate?Deloitte’s William D. Eggers and Paul Macmillan answer these questions and more, and they introduce us to the people and organizations driving the revolutionfrom edgy social enterprises growing at a clip of 15 percent a year, to megafoundations, to Fortune 500 companies delivering social good on the path to profit. Recyclebank, RelayRides, and LivingGoods are just a few of the innovative organizations you’ll read about in this book.Government cannot handle alone the huge challenges facing our global societyand it shouldn’t.

Ben & Jerry's fought back hard, with a scrappy campaign built around the slogan \"What's the Doughboy Afraid Of?\"\n\nWell-executed lawsourcing campaigns can deliver significant benefits to companies, including greater brand awareness and loyalty and increased sales. The author cites a number of examples, including:\n\nHampton Creek Foods Inc., a small San Francisco-based food producer. In the fall of 2014, Unilever, owner of the Hellmann's brand of mayonnaise, filed suit against Hampton Creek for using the word \"mayo\" to describe its vegan mayonnaise substitute, called Just Mayo. Hampton Creek fought back by commenting about the lawsuit on Twitter and Facebook and engaging with media sympathetic to its plight. Unilever withdrew its lawsuit.\n\nVermont artist Bo Muller-Moore, who sells T-shirts adorned with the slogan \"Eat More Kale.\" Atlanta-based fast-food chain Chik-fil-A Inc. claimed that Muller-Moore's slogan infringed upon its federal trademark rights to the phrase \"Eat Mor Chikin.\" After a spirited social media campaign, Muller-Moore got his own trademark.\n\nTesla Motors Inc., which is challenging state franchise regulations that restrict Tesla from selling cars directly to consumers. Tesla's strategy leverages company CEO Elon Musk's strong social media presence and the company's blog to inform sympathizers about the issues and urge them to tell regulators of their opposition to regulations restricting direct sales.The author notes several common themes for effective lawsourcing campaigns, including a compelling story; strong, engaged social media campaigns; direct appeals for support; leveraging social media for mainstream media exposure; and being authentic and following one's instincts.","tags":["Business","Economics","Next Economy"]},{"id":"9781576759080","language":"en","level":null,"title":"Blind Faith","authors":["Edward Winslow"],"publication_date":"May 2003","description":"The risk of investing in the stock market has increased remarkably over the last decade.

John Hope Bryant, founder and CEO of Operation HOPE, illuminates the path toward liberation that is hiding in plain sight. His message is simple: the supermajority of people who live in poverty, whom Bryant calls the invisible class, as well as millions in the struggling middle class, haven't gotten “the memo”—until now. Building on his personal experience of rising up from economically disadvantaged circumstances and his work with Operation HOPE, Bryant teaches readers five rules that lay the foundation for achieving financial freedom. He emphasizes the inseparable connection between “inner capital” (mindset, relationships, knowledge, and spirit) and “outer capital” (financial wealth and property). “If you have inner capital,” Bryant writes, “you can never be truly poor. If you lack inner capital, all the money in the world cannot set you free.” Bryant gives readers tools for empowerment by covering everything from achieving basic financial literacy to investing in positive relationships and approaching wealth with a completely new attitude. He makes this bold and controversial claim: “Once you have satisfied your basic sustenance needs—food, water, health, and a roof over your head—poverty has more to do with your head than your wallet.” Bryant wants to restore readers' “silver rights,” giving them the ability to succeed and prosper no matter what very real roadblocks society puts in their way. We have more power than we realize, if only we can recognize and claim it. “We are our first capital,” Bryant writes. “We are the CEOs of our own lives.”","tags":["Business","Economics"]},{"id":"9781631574160","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Producing Written and Oral Business Reports","authors":["Dr. Dorinda Clippinger"],"pages":"259","publication_date":"February 2017","description":"Producing Written and Oral Business Reports: Formatting, Illustrating, and Presenting emphasizes cost-effective methods for producing reports that will do what you want them to do.

So many, in fact, that even veterans don't know where to find them all. Microsoft solved this problem in PowerPoint 2007 by redesigning the user interface with a tabbed toolbar that makes features easy to locate and use. PowerPoint 2007 also boasts improved graphics, additional templates, the ability to save custom layouts, and improved collaboration through SharePoint. One thing Microsoft hasn't improved is its poor documentation. To learn the ins and outs of all the features in PowerPoint 2007, Microsoft merely offers online help. If you're familiar with previous versions of the program, you may be lost the first time you fire up the new PowerPoint; or you would be if it weren't for PowerPoint 2007: The Missing Manual.\n\nThis book, written specifically for this version of the software, not only offers the basics of how to create, save, set up, run, and print a basic bullets-and-background slideshow, but takes you into the world of multimedia, animation, and interactivity. You'll learn how to add pictures, sound, video, animated effects, and controls (buttons and links) to their slides, along with ways to pull text, spreadsheets, and animations created in other programs. You can also create your own reusable design templates and learn to automate repetitive tasks with macros.

They make things too complex. They clutter it with jargon and confusion. They pancake new initiatives on top of old ones. They dither on the launch pad. They chase too many fads. And they fail to make it “safe” for leaders to lead the transformation at their own level. In short, they don’t have a reliable corporate transformation game plan.\n\nWhatever your corporate transformation challenge, whatever your role, Robert H. Miles and Michael T. Kanazawa introduce a simple, proven, results-driven approach that has underpinned some of the most successful corporate transformations of our time. Drawing on their experience as principal process architects working with dozens of CEOs and executive teams, and hundreds of senior executives and staff professionals, they show you how to develop a compelling and potent corporate transformation game plan that enables you to align your organization behind just a few core initiatives; bias your people toward speed; create leaders at every level; integrate in new “disruptive” tools to accelerate progress; and achieve traction and accountability in all phases of execution.\n\nWhether you’re a new CEO taking charge to transform your company, an executive redirecting a major business or function, or one of the hundreds of managers and thousands of employees trying to make sense of a transformation and contribute to it, this book will help you decipher the complexity, find your place on the transformation roadmap, and ensure that the effort rapidly reaches its intended breakthrough results.\n\nA PROVEN, STEP-BY-STEP ROADMAP FOR TRANSFORMATION LEADERS – FAST, SIMPLE, AND COMPRESSED\n\nCorporate transformation and breakthrough performance without the confusion and complexity\n\nGEARED TO RAPIDLY ENGAGE THE FULL ORGANIZATION\n\nTo equip leaders at all levels to lead your transformation in an aligned and engaging manner\n\nFOCUSES EVERYONE ON “DOING MORE ONLESS”\n\nGenerates focused execution and avoid layering initiative upon initiative to conquer organizational gridlock\n\nDESIGNED TO “DISRUPT” HOW TRADITIONAL TRANSFORMATION PROGRAMS ARE DONE\n\nIntroduces disruptive transformation competencies that drive innovation, growth, and a new way of activating change\n\nCorporate transformation is tough work, but extraordinarily rewarding for all involved when led successfully. Somebody’s got to do it, and do it well. What if that someone happens to be you? Where will you start? How will you frame your transformation game plan and lay out its roadmap? What will you do first, and who will you engage when in the enterprise? How will you keep it alive after the early excitement? And how will you make it part of your management process so that it can become a reliable core competency for rising to the increasing rate of disruptive transformation challenges facing your company?\n\nNow there’s a breakthrough methodology to enable CEOs and executive leaders to rise to these corporate transformation challenges.\n\nIn this new edition of BIG Ideas to BIG Results, Robert H. Miles and Michael T. Kanazawa introduce a step-by-step guidebook for the Accelerated Corporate Transformation (ACT) methodology. A simple, no-nonsense process that is grounded in reality, inclusive of people, and oriented toward breakthrough results.

India is the fourth largest economy by gross domestic product. Economically, it is building itself as a formidable force and global influence. At the same time India has fundamental challenges: its inequities are visible; its young population tread a thin line between opportunity and pitfall; its infrastructure has gaping holes; and it’s a slow chaotic democracy. This book establishes that in spite of these challenges, a new India is emerging out of the old, colliding more often than collaborating with the old India. Much of the new India is built on the economic momentum established 20 years ago and built by private entrepreneurs. The new economic climate, together with talent and entrepreneurship, is also making India a net supplier of innovation. Going by current trends, India will become an innovation super power by 2035. This book will establish that India is not just leveraging innovation for global competitiveness alone, but is also leveraging innovation as the specific instrument for inclusive growth. This book identifies gaps in the current innovation ecosystem and recommends a portfolio approach and calls for a National Innovation System (NIS) as a blueprint to fix the gaps. It suggests that for India to succeed in identifying, funding and sustaining a balanced innovation portfolio, India will also have to succeed in eliminating poverty, increase its rural GDP manifold, and provide employment, education and health for all its citizens.Click Here to view the official page for this title on Facebook.\nEstablishes and analyses the trends that support India’s global emergence as an Innovation Superpower\nIdentifies three critical levels of innovation namely grassroots innovation, national innovation and innovation for global competitiveness\nRecommends a portfolio approach as a blueprint for the creation of a National Innovation System","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Innovation"]},{"id":"01520110012SI","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"X Marks the Spot: Developing and Retaining Emerging Leaders","authors":["David Baldwin","Stephanie Trovas"],"pages":"6","publication_date":"January 2002","description":"The future effectiveness and success of your organization depends to a large degree on its rising managers and professionals under thirty-five.

So many, in fact, that even veterans don't know where to find them all. Microsoft solved this problem in PowerPoint 2007 by redesigning the user interface with a tabbed toolbar that makes features easy to locate and use. PowerPoint 2007 also boasts improved graphics, additional templates, the ability to save custom layouts, and improved collaboration through SharePoint. One thing Microsoft hasn't improved is its poor documentation. To learn the ins and outs of all the features in PowerPoint 2007, Microsoft merely offers online help. If you're familiar with previous versions of the program, you may be lost the first time you fire up the new PowerPoint; or you would be if it weren't for PowerPoint 2007: The Missing Manual.\n\nThis book, written specifically for this version of the software, not only offers the basics of how to create, save, set up, run, and print a basic bullets-and-background slideshow, but takes you into the world of multimedia, animation, and interactivity. You'll learn how to add pictures, sound, video, animated effects, and controls (buttons and links) to their slides, along with ways to pull text, spreadsheets, and animations created in other programs. You can also create your own reusable design templates and learn to automate repetitive tasks with macros.

International CSR consultant Peter Baines draws upon lessons learnt from the challenges faced in his career as a police officer, forensic investigator, and founder of Hands Across the Water to describe the Australian CSR landscape, and the factors that make up a program that benefits everyone involved. Case studies illustrate the real effect of CSR on both business and society, with clear guidance toward maximizing involvement, engaging all employees, and improving the bottom line. The case studies draw out the companies that are focusing on creating shared value in meeting the challenges of society whilst at the same time bringing strong economic returns.\n\nConsumers are now expecting that big businesses with ever-increasing profits give back to the community from which those profits arise. At the same time, shareholders are demanding their share and are happy to see dividends soar. Getting this right is a balancing act, and Doing Good by Doing Good helps companies delineate a plan of action for getting it done. Readers will:\n\nDefine an effective CSR strategy that promotes better business and makes a real impact\n\nUnderstand the current landscape to evaluate the CSR options that are right for your company\n\nUnderstand why corporate philanthropy is no longer enough\n\nIdentify the hard and soft key performance indicators that help keep your program on track\n\nGain an understanding of the concept of shared value and the importance to business\n\nGain insight into each step of the CSR process, from interest, to information, to implementation\n\nThe concept of CSR is not new, but traditional \"payroll deductions\" and \"volunteer days\" are out-dated and grossly ineffective. Today, companies are building simple, well-constructed programs that are changing business and changing lives on a much grander scale.

But the central question for all managers - the one that separates great managers from the rest- is how to get the most from your people. What do you do when your most talented people fall short of their potential, or worse, fall off their game for awhile? How do you inspire a solid contributor to even more stellar performance? How do you find that spark? And turn it into a burning flame?According to best-selling author and psychiatrist, Ned Hallowell, it's all in the brain. Creating that spark and inspiring someone to perform at their highest levels isn't rocket science; but it is brain science, and it has yet to be codified into a simple and reliable process that all managers can use.Drawing from his expertise helping people reach their full potential and synthesizing the latest research on happiness, brain science, and performance, Hallowell does exactly that -- he offers a five step process that leads to peak performance. Based on the latest findings in the fast-moving field of high performance research and rooted in the work of Martin Seligman, Dan Gilbert, Marcus Buckingham, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, John Ratey, and many other experts in psychology and neuroscience, this book gives managers a simple and coherent framework for getting the best out of people:(1) Selection - how to put people in the right job, and give them the responsbilities that literally make their brains \"light up;\"(2) Connection - how to overcome the powerful forces that disconnect us interpersonally in today's workplace, and how to restore the positive connections that fuel superior performance;(3) Play - why play is essential to peak performance, and how managers can get it right;(4) Progress - when the pressure is on, how to challenge the right person at the right time;(5) Recognition - why reward systems always decrease peak performance, and how managers can finally get this rightThe value of the five steps is that each step builds on another. For instance, there's no point in challenging an employee to go beyond their personal best if you haven't bothered to ensure first that you've got them in the right job. And there's no way to successfully get someone to think more creatively if you haven't first established the personal connection with her so that she knows her wild ideas will be taken seriously. And there's no point in demanding more, if you haven't first given employees a chance to engage their imagination and play around with the things that \"light up their brains.\"Especially in times of mental overload and stress, when invoking people to suck it up or work even harder isn't an effective management tool, managers need a new game plan, like the one in this book, for helping their people perform at their best.","tags":["Business","Human Resources","Talent Management"]},{"id":"0321394704","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Your iPod Life: A Guide to the Best iPod Accessories from Playlist","authors":["Dan Frakes"],"pages":"136","publication_date":"November 2005","description":"Ranging from the silly (a $35 posable case that looks like a cat) to the sublime (the $400 Klipsch iFi digital music system), iPod accessories are almost as hot as the iconic music player itself.

By applying these principles, you'll open more doors, increase your productivity, speed up decisions, and close more deals.\"\n\n--Jill Konrath, author of SNAP Selling and Selling to Big Companies\n\nUsing Technology to Sell: Tactics to Ratchet Up Results shows salespeople and sales managers the most effective ways to leverage a variety of technologies to increase sales and gain more customers. Topics include making the most of cloud-based customer relationship management software, putting social media to the best use, presenting on three continents simultaneously through advanced video conferencing, using advanced techniques to gain an information edge over competitors, and much more.\n\nAs this book shows, while the sales process will remain pretty much the same from now until the end of time, technology used properly can increase sales power at every step of the cycle. Technology, in the right hands, is a strategic weapon and a competitive differentiation tool that can dramatically improve close rates, deal size, efficiency, total sales, and much more. Using Technology to Sell will show you how to:\n\nExpand your market through the use of technology.\n\nEmploy software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications to keep track of customers, stay organized, present, and sell more systematically.\n\nUse social media to increase sales.\n\nMaintain the personal element in a world wired with technology.\n\nUse the best sales methodology and integrate each step with technology.\n\nOvercome any aversion to using technology to sell.\n\nAvoid the trap of overuse or dependency on technology.\n\nWhat you'll learn\n\nHow to gain new customers and increase order size through the use of technology\n\nHow to employ cloud applications like SalesForce.com or BatchBook.com to keep track of customers, stay organized, and sell more systematically\n\nHow to use social media to increase sales\n\nHow to maintain the personal element in a world wired with technology\n\nThe best sales methodology and how to integrate each step with technology\n\nHow to avoid the trap of overuse or dependency on technology\n\nWho this book is for\n\nThere are many salespeople in the U.S. According to Selling Power magazine, roughly one in every 14 Americans works in a large sales force. The U.S. government puts the total number of salespeople at around 16 million. This does not include entrepreneurs, who don't usually classify themselves as salespeople but who need to have a strong sales capability. Nor does it include the number of people who use technology to support salespeople.\n\nWhile this book can help all of them, the primary audience is business-to-business salespeople (selling engines to car makers, ERP software to IT departments, office supplies to large companies, etc.). It is just as useful for the many business-to-consumer salespeople selling cars, electronics, insurance, services, and much more. Although the numbers are not as big, the book is crucially important to sales management who stand to benefit from systems that work and training staff on appropriate processes. Finally, the IT department in charge of implementing technology for salespeople can turn to this book in order to customize technology for their company's specific needs.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Sales"]},{"id":"9781430238799","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"iOS Wow Factor: Apps and UX Design Techniques for iPhone and iPad","authors":["Timothy Wood"],"pages":"144","publication_date":"November 2011","description":"With the millions of apps in the crowded Apple iTunes App Store, it can be difficult to get your apps noticed.

Within just one generation, China has transformed itself from an economically impoverished and politically unstable country to the second-largest economy in the world. But China faces monumental challenges, both economic and political, in the years ahead, notes author Yasheng Huang. As he explains, one thing we know about economic growth is that it typically slows down after a period of robust performance. It is much more difficult for a country to grow at a sustainably fast pace when the per capita GDP is high than when per capita GDP is low. Despite more than three decades of reforms, Huang argues, China is still substantially statist in its basic orientation. The result is that for each percentage point of GDP growth, China requires more and more energy and investments, with very worrisome implications for its environment and the health status of its population. China has grown by relying heavily on investments and exports and on its huge, low-cost labor force, not on technology and innovations. But there is increasing evidence that China is seeing diminishing returns with this growth model. Research shows that fast growth at an extremely low income level is relatively easy, although not every low-income country is able to grow. What is harder, says Huang, is being able to grow after the country has attained what is known as “middle-income status” (between $6,000 and $8,000 dollars per capita, a level that China has attained or is very close to attaining). Can China avoid the middle-income trap and grow at a sustained rate for another decade or more? Huang believes it can, but only if the country undertakes significant reforms, especially political reforms. As he points out, the factors that drive a country to grow when its per capita GDP is $700 are totally different from the growth drivers when a country has a per capita GDP near $7,000. At $700, China could simply copy and transplant the technology and production methods of other countries; it didn’t need to come up with its own innovations and technologies. Huang argues that China needs to transition to a stronger, market-based economic system, a political system that is more open and democratic, and a legal system that is rule-based and offers strong IP protection. There should be more freedom to think and to challenge authority, and limitations on the reach and power of government. In other words, China needs political reforms as well as economic reforms to enter the next stage of its growth model.","tags":["Business","Digital Economy","E-Commerce"]},{"id":"9781604913163","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Leadership in Action: Comfort Zone: How to Win Buy-In for Diversity Programs","authors":["Sarah Glover","Franchesca Carrington"],"pages":"4","publication_date":"June 2005","description":"Leaders need to set the tone for dealing with diversity appropriately.","tags":["Business","Human Resources","Workforce Diversity","Diversity and Inclusion"]},{"id":"53863MIT54108","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"The Gap Between the Vision for Marketing and Reality","authors":["Peter J.

Yet the average tenure of a chief marketing officer (CMO) is three and a half years, well below that of the typical CEO. Both the prevalence of the CMO position and its precariousness give rise to the question,“ Has marketing realized the vision to which its adherents have long aspired?”\n\nThe authors look at the IMB 2011 Global CMO Study to extrapolate trends in marketing. In the study, more than 1,700 CMOs were asked to rate how much influence they have over four key aspects of marketing. They were also asked to what extent their marketing organization captures, analyzes and acts on customer data. The authors calculate an overall metric, the “Full-Scale Marketing Index”, to measure average control over each of the four aspects, plus use of data. From their findings they explore whether it is important to follow the “Marketing Ideal” established over 60 years ago, and where Marketing goes from here.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Marketing"]},{"id":"9781604914900","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Leadership in Action: Leadership as Paranoia?","authors":["David Reisman"],"pages":"1","publication_date":"January 1999","description":"Intel chairman Andrew Grove, I believe, is driven by a singular, complex element, fundamental to his character, that makes not winning absolutely unacceptable.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"53863MIT57303","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Finding the Right Role for Social Media in Innovation","authors":["Frank T.

Yet the authors argue that there is a significant opportunity that isn’t being realized: utilizing social media to support innovation and new product development.\n\nConsultants and academics alike have touted social media as a vehicle for developing customer insights, accessing knowledge, cocreating ideas and concepts with users, and supporting new product launches. Yet despite this promise, the authors have found that the expected positive results are frequently not realized in practice. Although some companies have been able to use social media to develop new insights that lead to successful new products, many others simply do not know how to utilize social media for innovation. Some get distracted by the diversity of input and listen to the “wrong audience.” Nevertheless, the authors believe that social media provides a game-changing opportunity for companies that learn how to develop clear strategies and objectives.\n\nAnalyzing data on the social media practices of large global companies as they relate to new product development, the authors found that for the companies that jumped on the bandwagon and invested in social media initiatives without having a clear strategy, the right skills, or sufficient knowledge frequently did not achieve the results they were looking for. Those that utilized social media sources exclusively to search for technical information saw no improvements in new product development performance; in fact, the effect on performance for these companies was often negative (due to information overload and the complexity of processing such information). The companies that benefited the most from using social media for new product development were companies that used social media in every stage of the new product development processes; they built organizational processes and structures to support new product development activity.\n\nThe authors use the analogy of summer camp, a setting where children can explore and learn from everything they do. They describe three “camps”: Camp Explore, Camp Cocreate, and Camp Communicate. Each camp offers a distinctive approach to thinking about the different phases of the innovation process and delivers an important skill set.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Innovation"]},{"id":"53863MIT65306","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Trouble With Your Innovation Contests","authors":["Jasmijn Bol","Lisa LaViers","Jason Sandvik"],"pages":"7","publication_date":"January 2024","description":"New research shows that the way many organizations conduct innovation contests needs to be improved.

This book should help everyday supply chain practitioners involved in research and new product development, who are migrating their products to full commercialization. The book should also aid decision makers looking to improve the overall effectiveness and efficiency of their supply chain. When new products are developed, a significant divide typically emerges in trying to commercialize the product while attempting to meet project demands for cost, schedule, and quality. Simply put, in many cases the supply chains developed to accomplish R&D functions are usually woefully inadequate to meet the demands of large-scale commercial applications.

However, while these recent globalization efforts have their roots in cost arbitrage, successful companies must understand that globalization can be a means for shoring up competitive advantage to diversify intellectual capabilities and growth and improve quality enhancement opportunities.

Now all of your employees are Twittering away and friending clients on Facebook.

Employees are using this technology in the workplace and customers are using it in the marketplace, and neither obey the rules you set up.This chaos is your future as a manager. You could try to shut it down and shut it off. Or you can harness it and reap the business benefits.According to Josh Bernoff and Ted Schadler of Forrester Research (the organization that brought you Groundswell), your defense against insurgents is to enable them. At its heart, this is a book about how to scale the management of insurgency, both the innovation of insurgent employees and the energy of insurgent customers. The key is a process Forrester calls E Triple S, for the four elements of managing insurgents effectively: empowering, selecting, scaling, and socializing.While it's based in current trends, the core concept of Managing Insurgents -- that the next management and innovation challenge is harnessing individuals empowered by mobile, social, and connected technology -- is a new idea. In the wake of Groundswell, dozens of social-technology-for-business books cropped up. And there are plenty of books on improving your customer service. But there's no serious business book about management, marketing, and innovation in the throes of this trend.

Various experts have ventured theories about what kind of content makes for a hit. The advice varies widely and is even contradictory. Depending on the expert, success is thought more likely if a video is humorous, shocking, dramatic, topical, warm, arousing, angry, scary, socially beneficial, cute, violent, sexy, uplifting, intriguing, quirky, interesting, authoritative, tear-jerking, educational, controversial or baby- and animal-filled. One of the reasons for the various views is that researchers have often looked at only popular videos and did not compare the popular clips with the content almost no one saw. To see if they could clarify some of the contradictions, the authors examined a mix of popular and unpopular videos, then systematically coded and empirically tested the effect of each element on some relatively objective and observational measures of viewer engagement. The authors assigned a team of research assistants to watch 750 videos and to independently score each on a range of attributes. Did the video feature babies, attempt to be funny or use sexually suggestive content? How would watching the video make the typical viewer feel? They collected information on dozens of different video elements and correlated these with three measures of engagement: the number of times people left comments on the video, the overall “liking” index for each video (calculated by subtracting the number of “dislikes” from “likes”) and the number of views. The authors’ key finding? Emotionally surprising videos generated liking and views more than any kind of specific content element they studied. The authors also looked at novel and incongruous content and found that both were associated with feelings of surprise, which increased views and liking. To get viewers’ attention by surprising them, marketers have two good choices: Show viewers something they have never seen before, or show them two things they are familiar with but in an original, juxtaposed way.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Marketing","Content Marketing"]},{"id":"9781628251845","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"A guide to the PROJECT MANAGEMENT BODY OF KNOWLEDGE (PMBOK Guide)","authors":["Project Management Institute"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"September 2017","description":"To support the broadening spectrum of project delivery approaches, PMI is offering A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK® Guide) – Sixth Edition as a bundle with the new Agile Practice Guide.

The task of the global strategist involves not only identifying where to leverage a company’s existing strengths but also how to enhance and renew its capabilities.The authors argue that the risks of global expansion can be greatly reduced by taking a systematic approach to the decision-making process about entering a new country. They conclude that the experience of many global companies suggests that expensive mistakes are often made when companies don’t ask certain key questions before they make such internationalization decisions. By better understanding the nature of their own competitive advantages and how those advantages might fit into or be augmented by a new market, companies can greatly improve their chances of success. The authors illustrate their argument by drawing on the examples of companies such as CEMEX, Telefónica, Accor, Wal-Mart and IKEA.The authors propose two tests for the global strategist, one to use when a company is considering replicating a successful strategy in a new country, and the other to use when a company is seeking to acquire a new capability in a new market.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","International Business"]},{"id":"9781394206087","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"The Student Leadership Challenge, 4th Edition","authors":["James M.

Identify the needs behind estimate requests and determine how to meet those needs simply and easily. Choose estimation techniques based on current needs and available information, gaining benefit while reducing cost and effort. Detect bad assumptions that might sink your project if you don't adjust your plans. Discover what to do when an estimate is wrong, how to recover, and how to use that knowledge for future planning. Learn to communicate about estimates in a healthy and productive way, maximizing advantage to the organization and minimizing damage to the people.\n\nIn a world where most developers hate estimation and most managers fear disappointment with the results, there is hope for both. It requires giving up some widely held misconceptions. Let go of the notion that \"an estimate is an estimate\" and estimate for the particular need you, and your organization, have. Realize that estimates have a limited shelf-life, and reestimate frequently if it's important. When reality differs from your estimate, don't lament; mine that disappointment for the gold that can be the longer-term jackpot.\n\nEstimate in comparison to past experience, by modeling the work mathematically, or a hybrid of both. Learn strategies for effective decomposition of work and aspects of the work that likely affect your estimates. Hedge your bets by comparing the results of different approaches. Find out what to do when an estimate proves wrong. And they will. They're estimates, after all. You'll discover that you can use estimates to warn you of danger so you can take appropriate action in time. Learn some crucial techniques to understand and communicate with those who need to understand.\n\nAddress both the technical and sociological aspects of estimation, and you'll help your organization achieve its desired goals with less drama and more benefit.\n\nWhat You Need:\n\nNo software needed, just your past experience and concern for the outcomes.","tags":["Business","Project & Product Management","Project Management","Software Estimation"]},{"id":"9781098101848","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Communicating with Data","authors":["Carl Allchin"],"pages":"338","publication_date":"October 2021","description":"Data is a fantastic raw resource for powering change in an organization, but all too often the people working in those organizations don't have the necessary skills to communicate with data effectively.

But it is hard. It’s hard because it forces people and organizations to make specific choices about their future—something that doesn’t happen in most companies.Now two of today’s best-known business thinkers get to the heart of strategy—explaining what it’s for, how to think about it, why you need it, and how to get it done. And they use one of the most successful corporate turnarounds of the past century, which they achieved together, to prove their point.A.G. Lafley, former CEO of Procter & Gamble, in close partnership with strategic adviser Roger Martin, doubled P&G’s sales, quadrupled its profits, and increased its market value by more than $100 billion in just ten years. Now, drawn from their years of experience at P&G and the Rotman School of Management, where Martin is dean, this book shows how leaders in organizations of all sizes can guide everyday actions with larger strategic goals built around the clear, essential elements that determine business success—where to play and how to win.The result is a playbook for winning. Lafley and Martin have created a set of five essential strategic choices that, when addressed in an integrated way, will move you ahead of your competitors. They are:• What is our winning aspiration?• Where will we play?• How will we win?• What capabilities must we have in place to win?• What management systems are required to support our choices?The stories of how P&G repeatedly won by applying this method to iconic brands such as Olay, Bounty, Gillette, Swiffer, and Febreze clearly illustrate how deciding on a strategic approach—and then making the right choices to support it—makes the difference between just playing the game and actually winning.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy"]},{"id":"9781000878578","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"AI for Finance","authors":["Edward K.

The Global Credit Crisis during 2008/2009 has shown that sound understanding of underlying credit risk is crucial. If credit freezes, almost every activity in the economy is affected. The best way to utilize credit and get results is to understand credit risk.\n\nAdvanced Credit Risk Analysis and Management helps the reader to understand the various nuances of credit risk. It discusses various techniques to measure, analyze and manage credit risk for both lenders and borrowers. The book begins by defining what credit is and its advantages and disadvantages, the causes of credit risk, a brief historical overview of credit risk analysis and the strategic importance of credit risk in institutions that rely on claims or debtors. The book then details various techniques to study the entity level credit risks, including portfolio level credit risks.\n\nAuthored by a credit expert with two decades of experience in corporate finance and corporate credit risk, the book discusses the macroeconomic, industry and financial analysis for the study of credit risk. It covers credit risk grading and explains concepts including PD, EAD and LGD. It also highlights the distinction with equity risks and touches on credit risk pricing and the importance of credit risk in Basel Accords I, II and III. The two most common credit risks, project finance credit risk and working capital credit risk, are covered in detail with illustrations. The role of diversification and credit derivatives in credit portfolio management is considered. It also reflects on how the credit crisis develops in an economy by referring to the bubble formation. The book links with the 2008/2009 credit crisis and carries out an interesting discussion on how the credit crisis may have been avoided by following the fundamentals or principles of credit risk analysis and management.\n\nThe book is essential for both lenders and borrowers. Containing case studies adapted from real life examples and exercises, this important text is practical, topical and challenging. It is useful for a wide spectrum of academics and practitioners in credit risk and anyone interested in commercial and corporate credit and related products.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance"]},{"id":"9781119312574","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Sales EQ","authors":["Jeb Blount"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"March 2017","description":"The New Psychology of Selling\n\nThe sales profession is in the midst of a perfect storm. Buyers have more power—more information, more at stake, and more control over the sales process—than any time in history. Technology is bringing disruptive change at an ever-increasing pace, creating fear and uncertainty that leaves buyers clinging to the status quo. Deteriorating attention spans have made it difficult to get buyers to sit still long enough to “challenge,” “teach,” “help,” give “insight,” or sell “value.” And a relentless onslaught of “me-too” competitors have made differentiating on the attributes of products, services, or even price more difficult than ever.\n\nLegions of salespeople and their leaders are coming face to face with a cold hard truth: what once gave salespeople a competitive edge—controlling the sales process, command of product knowledge, an arsenal of technology, and a great pitch—are no longer guarantees of success. Yet this is where the vast majority of the roughly $20 billion spent each year on sales training goes.  It’s no wonder many companies are seeing 50 percent or more of their salespeople miss quota.  \n\nYet, in this new paradigm, an elite group of top 1 percent sales professionals are crushing it. In our age of technology where information is ubiquitous and buyer attention spans are fleeting, these superstars have learned how to leverage a new psychology of selling—Sales EQ—to keep prospects engaged, create true competitive differentiation, as well as shape and influence buying decisions. These top earners are acutely aware that the experience of buying from them is far more important than products, prices, features, and solutions.\n\nIn Sales EQ, Jeb Blount takes you on an unprecedented journey into the behaviors, techniques, and secrets of the highest earning salespeople in every industry and field. You’ll learn:\n\nHow to answer the 5 Most Important Questions in Sales to make it virtually impossible for prospects to say no\nHow to master 7 People Principles that will give you the power to influence anyone to do almost anything\nHow to shape and align the 3 Processes of Sales to lock out competitors and shorten the sales cycle\nHow to Flip the Buyer Script to gain complete control of the sales conversation\nHow to Disrupt Expectations to pull buyers towards you, direct their attention, and keep them engaged\nHow to leverage Non-Complementary Behavior to eliminate resistance, conflict, and objections\nHow to employ the Bridge Technique to gain the micro-commitments and next steps you need to keep your deals from stalling\nHow to tame Irrational Buyers, shake them out of their comfort zone, and shape the decision making process\nHow to measure and increase you own Sales EQ using the 15 Sales Specific Emotional Intelligence Markers\nAnd so much more!  \n\nSales EQ begins where The Challenger Sale, Strategic Selling, and Spin Selling leave off. It addresses the human relationship gap in the modern sales process at a time when sales organizations are failing because many salespeople have never been taught the human skills required to effectively engage buyers at the emotional level.  Jeb Blount makes a compelling case that sales specific emotional intelligence (Sales EQ) is more essential to success than education, experience, industry awareness, product knowledge, skills, or raw IQ; and, sales professionals who invest in developing and improving Sales EQ gain a decisive competitive advantage in the hyper-competitive global marketplace.\n\nSales EQ arms salespeople and sales leaders with the tool","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Sales"]},{"id":"9781118679173","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Trading Options: Using Technical Analysis to Design Winning Trades, + Website","authors":["Greg Harmon"],"pages":"240","publication_date":"February 2014","description":"A thorough guide to technical analysis methods applied for success in the options market\n\nThough still not widely practiced or accepted in the options market, technical analysis is becoming increasingly common.

You'll find a collection of the major lessons and shortcuts we've learned that will shift the odds in your favor. We're sharing our tips, secrets, and advice in a frank, founder-to-founder discussion with you.\n\nWe make no bones about our bias. We're on your side, the founder's side. While venture capitalists, investors, and accelerators/incubators can add great value in the startup ecosystem, this book isn't about their points of view. We'll tell you where our interests as founders diverge from those on the other side of the table—investors, bankers, advisors, board members, and others—and what to do when that happens.\n\nThe Startup Playbook is not a recipe, it's not a template, it's not a list of tasks to do. It's our insider's guide to starting a company and running it successfully in those critical early months. Between us, we've started over a dozen high-tech software companies and raised over $500 million in investment capital. We've acquired over thirty-five companies, had three of our startups go public, sold six of them, and we made billions of dollars for shareholders. We've also invested in over eighty startups, advised and mentored over two hundred companies and actively worked with venture capitalists (VCs), incubators, and accelerators to help launch many other new startups.\n\nWe've had plenty of failures, too. And we've probably learned more from those than from the successes. We share those lessons as well.\n\nThe Startup Playbook is full of our advice, guidance, do's, and don'ts from our years of experience as founders many times. We want to share our hard-earned knowledge with you to make success easier for you to achieve.\n\n\"This book is extraordinarily fresh and exciting. In an accessible, straight talk fashion, this book is a manual, and an inspiration. The Startup Playbook is smart and avoids the 'I am so smart' over-writing endemic to the genre. Read this as it is presented. You'll be doing yourself a tremendous favor.\"—Amazon Reviewer","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Entrepreneurship"]},{"id":"9781000898262","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Contemporary Issues in Marketing and Consumer Behaviour, 3rd Edition","authors":["Elizabeth Parsons","Pauline Maclaran","Andreas Chatzidakis"],"pages":"206","publication_date":"July 2023","description":"This third edition of Contemporary Issues in Marketing and Consumer Behaviour has been revised and updated to reflect the fast-changing world we live in.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Marketing"]},{"id":"9789352861163","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Entrepreneurship Development and Small Business Enterprises, 2nd Edition","authors":["Poornima M Charantimath"],"pages":"416","publication_date":"August 2013","description":"Related skill:","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Entrepreneurship"]},{"id":"9780429535222","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Mindful Project Management, 2nd Edition","authors":["Elmar Kutsch","Mark Hall"],"pages":"262","publication_date":"May 2020","description":"This book goes beyond commonly accepted standards in project management and looks beyond mere compliance to determinism and probabilistic approaches to managing uncertainty.

They fantasize about buying that condo in Boca Raton for their parents or surprising their son with a brand-new car on his 16th birthday. They even begin to imagine themselves opening their own trading firm or milling about the pit of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, lobbying against other professional traders for the perfect entry into a once-in-a-lifetime trade. But then ... they watch the markets lurch in wildly unpredictable ways, lose their shirts in a few live trades, and then freeze in their tracks, wondering if they will ever be able to consistently trade in a manner that can even loosely be defined as \"profitable.\"\n\nTo be sure, becoming a full-time, professional trader, working at a proprietary trading firm, or managing the trading activity of a hedge fund may sound like the perfect career, but it's all too easy for beginner traders to overestimate their trading abilities, underestimate the movements of the markets, and find themselves in a financial hole of epic proportions after a few bad trades. So what does it really take to make a living in the markets? Tim Bourquin, co-founder of Traders Expo and the Forex Trading Expo and founder of TraderInterviews.com, and freelance writer and editor Nick Mango set out to answer that exact question in Traders at Work, a unique collection of over 20 interviews with some of the world's most successful professional traders, from at-home hobbyists who have opened their own firms to those working at hedge funds, on proprietary trading desks, and in exchange pits.\n\nWhat mistakes did Anne-Marie Baiynd make early in her career? What does Michael Toma wish he had known about trading? What trading strategies work best for Linda Raschke? How does John Carter remain cool, calm, and collected when the markets are sending mixed signals? And how did Todd Gordon make the transition from part-time to full-time trader? Bourquin and Mango ask all of these questions and more in Traders at Work and in doing so reveal insider insights on what it takes to be a successful trader from those who are living that dream. Fascinating, compelling, and filled with never-before-told stories from the front lines of the trading arena, Traders at Work is required reading for anyone who has ever asked themselves if they have what it takes to trade for a living.\n\nWhat you'll learn\n\nHow some of the world's best traders became consistently profitable in the markets, quit their day jobs, and made the career transition to full-time trading\n\nHow to manage the roller coaster of your emotions and make smarter trading decisions in up, down, and sideways markets\n\nDaily techniques for minimizing your trading risks while maximizing your profit potential\n\nInsider stories from some of the most well-recognized prop desks and hedge funds in the financial industry\n\nThe most common mistakes leading traders made early on in their careers and how to avoid making them yourself\n\nWho this book is for\n\nTraders at Work is a book for active beginner to advanced retail traders, those thinking about trying their hand at trading, and those with retirement accounts or mutual funds who want to take a more active role in the management of their finances. It will also appeal to readers with a more general and passive interest in the financial markets who want to know how the markets work, how ordinary people can profit from them, and why the trading profession is so enticing to so many people. It is targeted to readers who buy how-to investing and trading books but who are also interested in the lifestyles and unique market experiences of those who trade for a living. Readers of Trading for a Living, Trade Your Way to Financial Freedom, The Way of the Turtle, and Market Wizards will be especially interested in the interviews contained in Traders at Work.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Financial Markets","Trading Stocks"]},{"id":"9781292460819","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"The Power of Women (eBook)","authors":["Parves Khan"],"pages":"176","publication_date":"November 2023","description":"Based on research with working professionals, this book identifies the toxic behaviours in the workplace affecting women and men and gives you practical ways to overcome them.

It enables organizations to become resilient and agile, carefully calibrating their responses and adapting quickly to new circumstances in a fast-changing environment.\n\nThis book is the most comprehensive treatment to date of the scenario planning process. Unlike existing books it offers a thorough discussion of the evolution and theoretical foundations of scenario planning, examining its connections to learning theory, decision-making theory, mental model theory and more. Chermack emphasizes that scenario planning is far more than a simple set of steps to follow, as so many other practice-focused books do—he addresses the subtleties and complexities of planning. And, unique among scenario planning books, he deals not just with developing different scenarios but also with applying scenarios once they have been constructed, and assessing the impact of the scenario project.\n\nUsing a case study based on a real scenario project Chermack lays out a comprehensive five phase scenario planning system—project preparation, scenario exploration, scenario development, scenario implementation and project assessment. Each chapter describes specific techniques for gathering and analyzing relevant data with a particular emphasis on the use of workshops to encourage dialogue. He offers a scenario project worksheet to help readers structure and manage scenario projects as well as avoid common pitfalls, and a discussion, based in recent neurological findings, of how scenario planning helps people to overcome barriers to creative thinking.\n\n“This book is about action and performance.

This book helps you get the most out of these two apps, showing you how to customize them, sync data across devices, and share meeting invitations and reminder lists. You’ll also learn how to use Siri as a shortcut and how to fix common problems.\n\nIn the days before personal computers and mobile devices, we had to rely on paper calendars and to-do lists to help us organize our time and activities. Now, we have powerful tools, like Apple’s Calendar and Reminders, that are much more responsive to our needs. Put an event on your schedule, invite others to join, or set yourself an alarm (or more than one). Or, keep a list of to-do items, add to it and view it on all your Apple devices, and share your list with family or friends.\n\nThe sixth edition features complete coverage of macOS 26 Tahoe, macOS 15 Sequoia, iOS 26/iPadOS 26, iOS 18/iPadOS 18, and watchOS 18 and 26, along with the new Apple Intelligence features on supported devices. Glenn guides you through getting to know these incredibly helpful apps, including lesser-known (but handy) features. For example, did you know that Calendar lets you set an alert that factors in public transportation schedules and time to get to your starting point, so you can leave early enough to catch the train, bus, tram, or ferry you need—and any connections—and arrive at your event on time?

If you’ve already been using Calendar and Reminders, you’ll learn how to use them more effectively, troubleshoot common problems, and delve deeper into their capabilities.\n\nLearn how to get the best out of Calendar and Reminders, including how to:\n\nCustomize Calendar to your liking, from setting time zones, to color coding specific calendars\nCreate events, making them repeat at regular intervals or on certain dates\nEmbed video links in Calendar events for quick launching\nAdd reminders from within the Calendar app\nUse the new Multi Day view in Calendar for iPhone\nSet up notifications and alerts, so you never miss an event\nInvite people to events, or share your calendar with them\nShare calendars and reminders using iCloud Family Sharing, and assign reminders to a specific person\nCreate, manage, and share lists in Reminders, including subtasks and powerful smart lists\nOrganize reminder lists into categories and optionally view them in columns\nDesignate a list as a grocery list, so that items auto-sort into supermarket departments\nSet alarms in Reminders at a certain time or a certain place\nUse Siri to save time when creating events or reminders\nEasily check events and reminders on your Mac, iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, or HomePod\nRecover deleted reminders within 30 days\nPrint a calendar (to paper or PDF)\nTroubleshoot common problems in Calendar and Reminders","tags":["Business","Business / Personal Technology","Personal Devices","Wearable Devices","Apple Watch"]},{"id":"9783110787474","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Inflation-Linked Bonds and Derivatives","authors":["Jessica James","Michael Leister","Christoph Rieger"],"pages":"129","publication_date":"January 2023","description":"Disruptions in supply chains and consumption patterns triggered by the pandemic together with stimulus packages and the energy crisis have catapulted inflation rates to levels last seen in the 1970s.

But human beings are still instinctively dominated by fear, a single complicating reflex which will always be the default response.\nWorkplace fear comes in many forms, including the fear of change, the fear of looking stupid, and the fear of working relationships, and in all cases these fears have deep roots that extend far below having to learn a new technology. It’s about the fear of losing a job, a livelihood, and an identity.\nThe results of such fear can have enormous repercussions on an organization, including increased vulnerability to ransomware and cyberattack, increased employee turnover, loss of competitiveness, loss of market share, resistance, sabotage, discrimination, and litigation.\nSteve Prentice is an expert in the relationship between people,technology, and change. This book will demonstrate to managers and employees alike the various types of fear that can occur in the workplace in the context of digital transformation, how these fears can impact productivity, team dynamics, and corporate health, and most importantly, how to overcome them.\nUsing case studies of digital transformation successes and failures, Steve describes:\nHow fear grows in the body and mind\nHow fear radiates and spreads through groups and teams\nHow fear interacts with technology, change, and digital transformation\nHow ignoring or suppressing fear leads to tangible risks to an organization’s future\nHow to address and manage fear individually and as a group\nHow the demands of modern employees have changed\nHow managers can prepare themselves for the new normal\nWho This Book Is For\n\nManagers who wish to look underthe hood and understand how people respond to the changes in their immediate world, and why most of those responses are negative.

If supply chains are managed successfully, companies will be able to deliver their products and services to customers in a smart, cost-effective way.\n\nThe key to successful supply chain management is recognising that its people who really drive the living supply chains that are at the heart of businesses. Supply chains are powered by the energy and expertise of employees and suppliers and by the changing wants and needs of customers. John Gattorna calls this principle of matching changing customer needs and desires with different supply chain strategies  dynamic alignment.\n\nTo secure space in a new market, to grow or keep existing markets companies have to get their products out there faster. They need to be the first with new products and services and the first to match them with particular customer groups. The dynamic alignment model gives a structured way of linking customer expectations to the operational side of business while maintaining the flexibility to systematically modify fulfilment processes as customers inevitably change their buying preferences.","tags":["Business","Operations","Supply Chain Management"]},{"id":"9781118239438","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"The Little Book of Bull's Eye Investing: Finding Value, Generating Absolute Returns, and Controlling Risk in Turbulent Markets","authors":["John F.

Still, the firms we work for, admire and invest in seem to take costly reputation hits all too often. Everyone interested in managing, regulating or investing in public firms will find Nir Kossovsky's book a wonderful read through reputations won, lost and regained over the last 20 years. This is the first book which goes beyond platitudes to explain how to spot value destroying reputation risk and how to manage it or live with its consequences. Couldn't be more timely.\"\n\n—Tom Skwarek, Managing Director|Structuring and Solutions Group, Unicredit Bank AG; previously Managing Director|Corporate Strategic Solutions, Swiss Re.\n\n\"There are fiduciary reasons why corporate directors would benefit from reading this book. There is also a personal benefit. The collapse of a company's reputation can stain the personal reputation of its directors.\"\n\n—George Miles, Member of the Board of Directors, AIG, EQT, Harley Davidson, HFF, and Wesco.\n\n\"Nir Kossovsky has written a gripping tale, first educating the reader, by distinguishing between corporate branding and reputation, then alarming us with case histories of mismanagement of corporate reputational crises, and finally reassuring all with a unique solution, i.e. insuring against the risk of reputational loss.\"\n\n—John H. Bennett, Partner, Global Brand Positioning, previously Chief Marketing Officer, Visa, Inc.\n\n\"While directors know reputation is important, it often is treated as a vague 'good' until something bad happens. Nir Kossovsky does a great job, with many examples, of connecting reputation to stock price and to behaviors, before and after crises. If you are a director, a senior manager, or a regulator, you should read this book and remember the lessons it offers. There is no office which will restore reputation, but careful planning and quick response, as Nir points out, can make a big difference.\"\n\n—Herbert S. Winokur, Jr., former chairman on Enron's Board Finance Committee and a director of many for-profits and non-profits\n\nA company that takes a hit to its reputation—BP after the Gulf oil spill, Barclays after fiddling LIBOR, News Corp after the phone hacking scandal—enters a world of grief: market value falls along with employee morale, regulatory scrutiny increases, and customers defect and boycott. Reputation, Stock Price, and You: Why the Market Rewards Some Companies and Punishes Others shows how a company's reputation is created and how reputational value impacts corporate P&L and the personal finances of its many stakeholders. Better yet, it shows what you can do to profit from, increase, protect, monitor, evaluate, restore, and even insure reputational value.\n\nIf your job, bonus, options, salary, or investments depend on the stock price of a public company—or on the sales, profitability, or value of a private company—you need to read this book to understand the concrete steps you can take to improve your firm's reputation, reduce risks to its finances and industry standing, and reap the highest reputational dividends. Using dozens of case studies, Reputation, Stock Price, and You:\n\nExplains how stakeholders, and their expectations, both shape and are shaped by a company's reputation\n\nDescribes how reputations for ethics, innovation, governance, quality, safety, sustainability, and security are created and lost\n\nShows how you can influence the expectations and behaviors of stakeholders, which in turn can improve corporate finances, reduce operational risk, and increase stock price or market value\n\nProvides sensitive tools for tracking and predicting stock price as a function of reputational value metrics\n\nThe majority of directors at U.S. public companies now count reputation as their firm's #1 concern, and with good reason. A firm with a superior reputation gains many benefits: Customers are more willing to pay higher prices, vendors and employees offer better terms for their services, creditors and equity investors offer better terms for capital, and regulators tend to be more forgiving. This book shows how to achieve and sustain a stellar reputation and how to convert it into its tangible form: reputational value.\n\nWhat you'll learn\n\nHow stakeholder expectations for a company help shape a company's reputation\n\nHow actions taken by a company in managing ethics, innovation, governance, quality, safety, sustainability, and security shape stakeholder expectations\n\nHow a company's reputation affects stakeholder behavior\n\nHow corporate executives and directors have the unique opportunity to frame the entire reputation-forming process and build it into governance policies\n\nWhy professional marketing, and communications efforts play a relatively minor role in reputation formation\n\nHow the behavior of stakeholders collectively determine a company's stock price or market value\n\nHow to measure and improve your company's reputation and thus improve results in all areas\n\nWho this book is for\n\nReputation, Stock Price and You is for senior executives and mid-level managers, directors, and market analysts, fund managers, and sophisticated individual investors.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Corporate Valuation"]},{"id":"9780071799874","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Candlestick Charting Demystified","authors":["Wayne A.

Wealth management practitioners are commonly taught the traditional mean-variance approach in CFA and similar curricula, a method with increasingly limited applicability given the evolution of investment products and our understanding of real-world client preferences. Additionally, financial advisors and researchers typically receive little to no training on how to implement a robust asset allocation framework, a conceptually simple yet practically very challenging task. This timely book offers professional wealth managers and researchers an up-to-date and implementable toolset for managing client portfolios. \n\nThe information presented in this book far exceeds the basic models and heuristics most commonly used today, presenting advances in asset allocation that have been isolated to academic and institutional portfolio management settings until now, while simultaneously providing a clear framework that advisors can immediately deploy. This rigorous manuscript covers all aspects of creating client portfolios: setting client risk preferences, deciding which assets to include in the portfolio mix, forecasting future asset performance, and running an optimization to set a final allocation. An important resource for all wealth management fiduciaries, this book enables readers to:\n\nImplement a rigorous yet streamlined asset allocation framework that they can stand behind with conviction\nDeploy both neo-classical and behavioral elements of client preferences to more accurately establish a client risk profile\nIncorporate client financial goals into the asset allocation process systematically and precisely with a simple balance sheet model\nCreate a systematic framework for justifying which assets should be included in client portfolios\nBuild capital market assumptions from historical data via a statistically sound and intuitive process\nRun optimization methods that respect complex client preferences and real-world asset characteristics\n\nModern Asset Allocation for Wealth Management is ideal for practicing financial advisors and researchers in both traditional and robo-advisor settings, as well as advanced undergraduate and graduate courses on asset allocation.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance"]},{"id":"9781647822354","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"HBR Guide to Being a Great Boss","authors":["Harvard Business Review"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"January 2022","description":"Are you a good boss—or a great one?\n\nGood bosses can handle the day-to-day work of running a team.

From the international bestselling author of Self-Confidence.\n\nAre You A Worrier?\n\nDo you seem to worry more than most? Do you find that insignificant things stress you out? Do you sweat the small stuff and the big stuff too? Well, now's the time to stop worrying and start living.\n\nWorry, stress, anxiety - whichever label you prefer to use - can have consequences that impact not only our lives, but the lives of others around us. When we worry it's like the engine of our mind is constantly being revved up. It doesn't allow us time to switch off and rest. It tires you out. And when you're tired you're less likely to think straight. And when you're not thinking straight it's easy to make stupid mistakes and confuse priorities...\n\nBut relax. There is a way forward.\n\nIn How Not to Worry Paul McGee shows us that there is a way to tackle life's challenges in a calmer and more considered way. It is possible to use a certain degree of worry and anxiety to spur us on towards positive, constructive action, and then leave the rest behind. With down to earth, real life advice, How Not to Worry helps us understand why worrying is such a big deal and the reasons for it, exposing the behavioural traps we fall into when faced with challenges. It then helps us to move on with tools and ideas to deal with our worries in a more constructive way.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Development","Stress Management"]},{"id":"9780814417690","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"The AMA Handbook of Business Documents","authors":["Kevin WILSON","Jennifer WAUSON"],"pages":"224","publication_date":"May 2011","description":"Need to put it in writing?

Debtors need an up-to-date guide that can help them assess options, find help, discover opportunities, and take action that works. Liz Weston's Deal with Your Debt, Updated and Revised Edition is that guide. In this extensively updated guidebook, Weston shows which debts can actually help build wealth over time, and which are simply toxic. She presents up-to-date, real-world strategies for assessing and paying off debt, including money-saving insights on which debts to tackle first. She also offers practical guidelines for assessing how much debt is safe -- and compassionate, realistic guidance for people who've gone beyond the safety zone.\n\nIn There Are No Dumb Questions About Money, nationally-renowned personal finance journalist and best-selling author Liz Weston answers your most pressing questions, helping you navigate today's more-complicated-than-ever financial world.

You'll discover why most investment strategies don't work, and identify better ways to save for retirement.

But effective teamwork isn't only a group skill set; it's an individual skill set as well. Teamwork Is an Individual Skill shows readers how to develop the skills to thrive on any team, under any circumstances. No longer will readers find themselves complaining, \"I got assigned to a bad team.\" Instead, they'll know what to do to make any team work for them.Drawing on over twenty years of experience successfully developing professional teams in product development, R&D, and high-tech environments, Christopher Avery and his coauthors use brief thought-provoking essays, personal and teambuilding exercises, case studies, and insights from business leaders to teach readers how to build responsible and productive relationships at work. The authors show how and why your ability to assume personal responsibility-for your own work on a team and for the team's collective work-is the most important factor in ensuring a productive team experience.Teambuilding, the authors point out, is essentially a series of conversations between people who share responsibility to get something done. Teamwork Is an Individual Skill describes the way these conversations typically progress, and shows the reader how to predict and direct these conversations so that they can maximize the benefits to both themselves and to their team.Designed for easy access and for use by both individuals and groups, Teamwork Is an Individual Skill will equip readers with the mental skills and behaviors that will help them achieve personal goals while contributing to their team's success.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Team Management"]},{"id":"9781118991800","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"IC3: Internet and Computing Core Certification Computing Fundamentals Study Guide","authors":["Ciprian Adrian Rusen"],"pages":"204","publication_date":"April 2015","description":"Test how well you know your way around a computer for the IC3 exam\n\nIC3: Internet and Computing Core Certification Computing Fundamentals Study Guide is your ideal study guide to focus on the Computing Fundamentals exam module in preparation for the IC3 exam.

Quantitative Methods: An Introduction for Business Management presents the application of quantitative mathematical modeling to decision making in a business management context and emphasizes not only the role of data in drawing conclusions, but also the pitfalls of undiscerning reliance of software packages that implement standard statistical procedures. With hands-on applications and explanations that are accessible to readers at various levels, the book successfully outlines the necessary tools to make smart and successful business decisions.\n\nProgressing from beginner to more advanced material at an easy-to-follow pace, the author utilizes motivating examples throughout to aid readers interested in decision making and also provides critical remarks, intuitive traps, and counterexamples when appropriate.\n\nThe book begins with a discussion of motivations and foundations related to the topic, with introductory presentations of concepts from calculus to linear algebra. Next, the core ideas of quantitative methods are presented in chapters that explore introductory topics in probability, descriptive and inferential statistics, linear regression, and a discussion of time series that includes both classical topics and more challenging models. The author also discusses linear programming models and decision making under risk as well as less standard topics in the field such as game theory and Bayesian statistics. Finally, the book concludes with a focus on selected tools from multivariate statistics, including advanced regression models and data reduction methods such as principal component analysis, factor analysis, and cluster analysis.\n\nThe book promotes the importance of an analytical approach, particularly when dealing with a complex system where multiple individuals are involved and have conflicting incentives. A related website features Microsoft Excel® workbooks and MATLAB® scripts to illustrate concepts as well as additional exercises with solutions.\n\nQuantitative Methods is an excellent book for courses on the topic at the graduate level. The book also serves as an authoritative reference and self-study guide for financial and business professionals, as well as readers looking to reinforce their analytical skills.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting"]},{"id":"9780132469043","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"How to Focus on What Matters","authors":["Jurgen Wolff"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"February 2010","description":"This Element is an excerpt from Focus: Your Key to More Productivity at Work (ISBN: 9780137002566) by Jurgen Wolff. Available in print and digital formats.\n\nHow to manage information overload so you can focus your efforts where you can have the greatest impact!\n\nInformation overload is one of the biggest problems plaguing creative people, who are naturally curious and tend to seek lots of ideas.

Often, as a leader, manager, doctor, teacher, or coach, it's central to your job. But even the most well-intentioned efforts to help others can be undermined by a simple truth: We almost always focus on trying to \"fix\" people, correcting problems or filling the gaps between where they are and where we think they should be. Unfortunately, this doesn't work well, if at all, to inspire sustained learning or positive change.\n\nThere's a better way. In this powerful, practical book, emotional intelligence expert Richard Boyatzis and Weatherhead School of Management colleagues Melvin Smith and Ellen Van Oosten present a clear and hopeful message. The way to help someone learn and change, they say, cannot be focused primarily on fixing problems, but instead must connect to that person's positive vision of themselves or an inspiring dream or goal they've long held. This is what great coaches do--they know that people draw energy from their visions and dreams, and that same energy sustains their efforts to change, even through difficult times. In contrast, problem-centered approaches trigger physiological responses that make a person defensive and less open to new ideas.\n\nThe authors use rich and moving real-life stories, as well as decades of original research, to show how this distinctively positive mode of coaching—what they call \"coaching with compassion\"--opens people up to thinking creatively and helps them to learn and grow in meaningful and sustainable ways.\n\nFilled with probing questions and exercises that encourage self-reflection, Helping People Change will forever alter the way all of us think about and practice what we do when we try to help.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Development"]},{"id":"9781947098718","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"The Basics of Foreign Exchange Markets, 2nd Edition","authors":["William D. Gerdes"],"pages":"104","publication_date":"March 2018","description":"In an increasingly interdependent global economy, an understanding of foreign exchange markets is more critical than ever. These markets are inextricably entwined with underlying monetary standards and consequently they are treated conjointly in this book. Four different foreign exchange rate regimes are analyzed including exchange rates under commodity money, fiduciary money, fiat money (with fixed exchange rates), and fiat money (with flexible exchange rates).\n\nFor more than eight decades, most countries have operated with fiat money. Proponents maintain that fiat money provides individual countries with much greater monetary autonomy. Yet both analytics and experience indicate that this is not always the case. Whether a country has more monetary autonomy depends on whether fiat money is paired with fixed or flexible exchange rates. Although flexible exchange rate regimes are not without their critics, it has become increasingly apparent that fiat money with flexible rates provides individual countries much greater monetary autonomy. This arrangement allows participants in foreign exchange markets greater latitude for adjusting to the wide variations in national monetary policies that are prevalent with fiat money.\n\nSeveral audiences may find this book beneficial: undergraduate students in economics and finance, students of international business, graduate students, students in executive programs who need to expand their knowledge of international finance, and practicing executives and managers—especially those who are employed by companies operating globally.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Financial Markets","Forex"]},{"id":"9781394177400","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Humanizing Rules","authors":["Christian Hunt"],"pages":"240","publication_date":"March 2023","description":"Manage and mitigate the human side of risk\n\nIn Humanizing Rules: Bringing Behavioural Science to Ethics and Compliance, veteran risk adviser and trainer Christian Hunt delivers an incisive and practical discussion of how to mitigate the risk of people doing things they shouldn't or failing to do things they should.

Purpose, or an underlying company philosophy, not only drives strategic change, but also encourages customer loyalty and employee engagement. In order to succeed, leaders must be willing to discard old ways of thinking and detrimental business habits—and recognize their blind spots.\nAuthors Jim Haudan and Rich Berens identify the five most common leadership blind spots that hamper success: Purpose, Story, Engagement, Trust, and Truth.

Organizations now operate in a global environment. New technologies continue to disrupt how, when, and where work is done and should be managed. The workforce is becoming more diverse. Sustainability has joined profitability as a key business goal. All of this has dramatically accelerated the pace of change, making recruiting the best talent—not simply filling positions—an overriding concern. But too many organizations still use a job-based, bureaucratic talent management approach that doesn't take into account how the world has changed. Indeed, a recent study showed that from 1995 to 2016, there was no significant change in the way HR spends its time.Lawler says that talent management has to be reinvented. It needs to be closely linked to the organization's overall strategy. Recruitment and talent management should be driven by the skills and competencies the organization needs for long-term growth. This means talent management requires agile systems that can respond quickly to changing conditions and that take a more individualized approach to evaluating and rewarding performance. And everything talent management does has to be based on evidence, not tradition. Lawler looks at attracting, selecting, developing, rewarding, managing, and organizing talent through this new lens. In today's world, organizations have to constantly reinvent themselves—and talent management must do the same.","tags":["Business","Human Resources","Talent Management"]},{"id":"9781422170724","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"What I Didn't Learn in Business School","authors":["Jay Barney","Trish Gorman Clifford"],"pages":"272","publication_date":"October 2010","description":"Meet John Downs.

Soon consumers will be able to: Control the flow and use of personal data Build their own loyalty programs Dictate their own terms of service Tell whole markets what they want, how they want it, where and when they should be able to get it, and how much it should costAnd they will do all of this outside of any one vendor’s silo. This new landscape we’re entering is what Doc Searls calls The Intention Economyone in which demand will drive supply far more directly, efficiently, and compellingly than ever before. In this book he describes an economy driven by consumer intent, where vendors must respond to the actual intentions of customers instead of vying for the attention of many.New customer tools will provide the engine, with VRM (Vendor Relationship Management) providing the consumer counterpart to vendors’ CRM (Customer Relationship Management) systems. For example, imagine being able to change your address once for every company you deal with, or combining services from multiple companies in real time, in your own waysall while keeping an auditable accounting of every one of your interactions in the marketplace. These tantalizing possibilities and many others are introduced in this book.As customers become more independent and powerful, and the Intention Economy emerges, only vendors and organizations that are ready for the change will survive, and thrive.

Workers struggle to find answers and information across organizational databases and boundaries and silos. New comfort with social sharing, combined with the proliferation of new social tools, offer easy, useful means of sharing not just what we do but how we get things done. For the organization this supports productivity, improves performance, encourages reflective practice, speeds communication, and helps to surface challenges, bottlenecks, and that elusive tacit knowledge. For the worker it illuminates strengths, talents, struggles, and the reality of how days are spent. For the coworker or colleague it solves a problem, saves time, or builds on existing knowledge.

By highlighting specific ways to transform both good and bad surprises into unique opportunities, Kaplan encourages leaders to compete by embracing counterintuitive ideas, managing paradoxes, and even welcoming failure. This is the key to “leapfrogging”—creating or doing something radically new or different that produces a significant leap forward.\n\nLeapfrogging connects new research, unconventional strategies, and practical tools for navigating the “messy” and elusive process of achieving business breakthroughs. Filled with real-world examples from innovators such as Gatorade, Intuit, Philips, Kimberly-Clark, Colgate-Palmolive, OpenTable, and Etsy, Kaplan shows that any organization or business function can leapfrog. Using his LEAPS process (Listen, Explore, Act, Persist, and Seize), leaders learn to seek out, recognize, and respond to surprising experiences and events as a way to create solutions that leap beyond the current expectations of customers, partners, employees, the market, and the competition. Kaplan’s Leapfrogging is the new handbook for the modern leader.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Innovation"]},{"id":"9781394254293","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Burnt Out to Lit Up","authors":["Daisy Auger-Dominguez"],"pages":"240","publication_date":"September 2024","description":"A timely and incisive resource for business leaders and people managers struggling with complacency and burnout in this rapidly evolving world of work\n\nFacing the challenges of global cultural, commercial, political, and technological shifts, managers are in dire need of strategies to move from survival to revival.\n\nBurnt Out to Lit Up: How to Reignite the Joy of Leading People by Daisy Auger-Domínguez illuminates the often overlooked and difficult aspects of management and offers a lifeline for managers struggling to adapt and thrive.

When he writes 'Go to the Gemba and Run Your Kaizen,' we must take heed.\" -- MASAAKI IMAI, bestselling author of Kaizen and Gemba Kaizen\n\n\"In this wonderful and important book, Byrne shows us that Lean management, understood and practiced correctly, consistently delivers spectacular results.\" -- BOB EMILIANI, author, Better Thinking, Better Results, and Professor, Connecticut State University\n\n\"A compelling picture of how Lean techniques and attitudes enable CEOs and senior executives to create a culture for transforming a company and putting it on a highperformance path.\" -- JERRY J.

KAPLAN, MD, Chairman and CEO of the Virginia Mason Health System\n\nLean isn't just for manufacturing anymore . . .\n\nFew business leaders in the world have applied Lean strategy as successfully as Art Byrne has--and none has the ability to explain how to do it with such succinctness and clarity.\n\nFamous for turning around the wire management company Wiremold, where he rethought every aspect of operations from the customer's standpoint--and got everyone else in the company to do likewise--Byrne has successfully implemented Lean strategies in more than 30 companies in 14 different countries.\n\nIn The Lean Turnaround, this legendary business leader shares everything he has learned during his remarkable career and shows how anyone can achieve similar results. His primary message is this: Lean strategy isn't just for manufacturing. In fact, Byrne is using this very approach in his present position at a private equity firm.\n\nWhatever type of company you run, Lean can be used to improve virtually every aspect of operations, from training and leading employees to accounting and payroll issues. The Lean Turnaround explains all the ins and outs of applying Lean strategy to:\n\nEliminate waste in every value-added operation\nDeliver consistent value to customers\nStimulate growth and add jobs\nIncrease wealth for all your stakeholders\nBuild a company culture of continuous improvement (kaizen)\n\nInstead of attempting to get customers to conform to your way of doing things--which is, sadly, what most managers are taught to do--you need to configure your company to be responsive to the customers.

At end 2004, the market size hit $6.4 billion (in notional amounts) from virtually nothing in 1995. This rise has been spurred by the imperative for banks to better manage their risks, not least credit risks, and the appetite shown by institutional investors and hedge funds for innovative, high yielding structured investment products. As a result, growth in collateralized debt obligations and other second-generation products, such as credit indices, is currently phenomenal. It is enabled by the standardization and increased liquidity in credit default swaps – the building block of the credit derivatives market.\n\nWritten by market practitioners and specialists, this book covers the fundamentals of the credit derivatives and structured credit market, including in-depth product descriptions, analysis of real transactions, market overview, pricing models, banks business models.

There is considerable heterogeneity when comparing individual technology-focused acquisitions – especially with respect to acquisition timing and the deal value.\n\nTo resolve some of this heterogeneity the author introduces the novel distinction between performance- and functionality-focused acquisitions. He characterizes this distinction based on a theoretical analysis, a qualitative study, and turns to a sample of acquisitions in the field of artificial intelligence for the quantitative study.\n\nThere are two key findings. First, performance-focused acquisitions take place earlier in a target’s life cycle than functionality-focused ones. Second, the deal value is – at a comparable stage in a target’s life cycle – higher for performance-focused acquisitions.\n\nThis thesis is relevant for management scholars and managers alike: Scholars learn about the implications of the distinction between performance- and functionality-focused acquisitions on markets for technology.

To be successful, leaders need to sort out what's important, devise strategies based on their own point of view, and get there ahead of the crowd. But most leaders today are just concerned about getting there in time. Many are even willing to settle for getting there fashionably late. They focus on quick-fix problems, avoiding the kinds long-term of dilemmas that will characterize the future. But as Institute for the Future's ten-year forecast—which is included in the book—makes clear, today's leaders face more and more dilemmas: recurring, complex, messy, and puzzling.Bob Johansen shares techniques refined over nearly forty years by the Institute of the Future to help you navigate your own organization's road to the future. He details real-world examples of how organizations like Procter & Gamble, Disney, Reuters, UPS, and the Centers for Disease Control have put these approaches into practice. Through fascinating and illustrative examples—including the Toyota Prius, the iPod, Crest Toothpaste, and many more—he shows that getting there early means finding new markets, new customers, and new products ahead of your competitors. It means anticipating the needs of your stakeholders. It means you'll be able to establish a position before your late-arriving competitors even have a chance to organize. It helps you think through what might happen and what should happen. It gives you time to consider alternative strategies. Ultimately, getting there early helps you see beyond the problems of the present and recognize possible futures before others do. Get There Early lays out the Institute's three-step Foresight to Insight to Action Cycle that allows you to sense, make sense of, and win when faced with dilemmas.

Who can feel safe in firestorm change? The authors of The Phoenix Encounter Method don’t advise safety. In fact, their method of leadership thinking requires you to imagine burning your business to the ground—throwing yourself into a firestorm change—and turning the upheaval to your organization’s advantage. It can then rise, phoenix-like, from the ashes, stronger and more powerful than ever. Written with a sense of urgency and purposefully radical provocation, The Phoenix Encounter Method represents the forward thinking of legendary business guru Ram Charan and professors from the senior global leadership program of INSEAD, one of the world’s top graduate business schools. The resulting methodology, based on analysis of thousands of articles, studies, reports, and academic and business practice, was field tested in real-life Phoenix Encounters conducted with more than fifteen hundred senior executives—from startups and family businesses to legacy companies—representing a broad range of industry and sectors in both developed and developing economies. Whatever your sector or industry, if you’re responsible for your organization’s ability to use change as a transformative opportunity, you’ll appreciate the dramatic impact The Phoenix Encounter Method will have on you, your leadership, and your organization.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy"]},{"id":"9780132900461","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Technical Analysis of Gaps: Identifying Profitable Gaps for Trading","authors":["Julie R.

They’re not merely conspicuous: they represent price jumps that could signal profitable trading opportunities. Until now, however, \"folklore\" about gap trading has been common, and tested, research-based knowledge virtually nonexistent. In Technical Analysis of Gaps, renowned technical analysis researchers Julie Dahlquist and Richard Bauer change all that. Drawing on 60 years of comprehensive data, they demonstrate how to sort \"strategic\" gaps from trivial ones, and successfully trade on gaps identified as significant. Building on work that recently earned them the Market Technicians Association’s 2011 Charles H.

They consider a wide variety of market conditions, including gap size, volume and previous price movement, illuminating their findings with easy-to-understand diagrams.

How could they not have noticed?'. You think you can solve your human error problem by telling people to be more careful, by reprimanding the miscreants, by issuing a new rule or procedure. These are all expressions of 'The Bad Apple Theory', where you believe your system is basically safe if it were not for those few unreliable people in it. This old view of human error is increasingly outdated and will lead you nowhere. The new view, in contrast, understands that a human error problem is actually an organizational problem. Finding a 'human error' by any other name, or by any other human, is only the beginning of your journey, not a convenient conclusion. The new view recognizes that systems are inherent trade-offs between safety and other pressures (for example: production). People need to create safety through practice, at all levels of an organization. Breaking new ground beyond its successful predecessor, The Field Guide to Understanding Human Error guides you through the traps and misconceptions of the old view. It explains how to avoid the hindsight bias, to zoom out from the people closest in time and place to the mishap, and resist the temptation of counterfactual reasoning and judgmental language. But it also helps you look forward. It suggests how to apply the new view in building your safety department, handling questions about accountability, and constructing meaningful countermeasures. It even helps you in getting your organization to adopt the new view and improve its learning from failure. So if you are faced by a human error problem, abandon the fallacy of a quick fix.

The time between signing and closing a deal is a particularly risky period where the buyer has committed to purchase the company, but the seller continues to operate it while waiting for regulatory approval or funding to close out the deal. A Material Adverse Change clause allows the buyer to back out of the transaction if certain adverse events occur during this period. By designing this safety net into the contract, you’re free to take the time to examine records, meet with employees, and fully understand the legal issues at hand. If the target loses value during that time, in certain cases, you’re free to walk away. This book explores the full power of the Material Adverse Change clause, and today’s M&A in general. You’ll dig into the real causes of M&A failure, and discover the traits and practices that lead to poor results as you learn how to avoid these common mistakes and drive more successful deals. Recent case studies highlight common mistakes made—and propagated—by otherwise intelligent people, so you can identify and eliminate these practices within your own organization.\n\nA large acquisition is already a delicate balancing act. Why complicate it with the exponential risk by not doing your homework? This book shows you how to apply best practices to increase your chances of successful deals and avoid potentially career ending mistakes. \n\nExplore the true root causes of M&A failures of the past\nAnalyze the personality traits that drive suboptimal outcomes\nImplement new practices to avoid mistakes and close successful deals\nLearn why common-sense errors are repeated over and over again\nThe M&A market has grown to become a major factor in the global economy, yet many buyers do less investigation than consumers making everyday purchases.

Paterson"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"January 2015","description":"\"How can you argue with the core principles of Lean, that you focus on what provides value to your customer and eliminate work that is not necessary (muda)? Internal auditors need to understand not only who their primary customers are, but what is valuable to them - which in most cases is assurance that the risks that matter to the achievement of objectives are properly managed. We need to communicate what they need to know and not what we want to say. This incessant focus on the customer and the efficient production of a valued product should extend to every internal audit team. How else can we ensure that we optimize the use of our limited resources to address the dynamic business and risk environment within which our organizations operate?\"\n\nNorman Marks, GRC Thought Leader\n\nUsing lean techniques to enhance value add and reduce waste in internal auditing\n\nLean Auditing is a practical guide to maximising value and efficiency in internal audit through the application of lean techniques. It is an ideal book for anyone interested in understanding what progressive, value adding audit can be like. It is also ideal for anyone wondering whether audit activities can be streamlined or better co-ordinated with other activities.\n\nThe book contains practical advise from the author's experience as CAE of AstraZeneca PLC; from his work as a consultant specializing in this field; as well as insights from leading CAEs in the UK, US and elsewhere. In addition, there are important insights from thought leaders such as Richard Chambers (IIA US) and Norman Marks (GRC thought leader) and Chris Baker (Technical Manager of the IIA UK).\n\nIncreasing pressure on resources is driving a need for greater efficiency in all areas of business, and Internal Audit is no exception. Lean techniques can help streamline the workflow, but having only recently been applied to IA, lack the guidance available for other techniques. Lean Auditing fills this need by combining expert instruction and actionable advice that helps Internal Auditors:\n\nBenchmark their efficiency against lean ways of working\n\nUnderstand warning signs of waste and lower added value\n\nUnderstanding practical ways of working that improve added value and reduce waste\n\nGain confidence about progressive ways of working in internal audit\n\nUnderstand how improved ways of working in audit can positively impact the culture of the wider organization\n\nOne of the keys to the lean audit is finding out exactly what the stakeholder wants, and eliminating everything else. Scaling back certain operations can delineate audit from advisory, and in the process, dramatically improve crucial outcomes. To this end, Lean Auditing is the key to IA efficiency.","tags":["Business","Project & Product Management","Product Management","Lean"]},{"id":"9781484286807","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"How to Develop Your Creative Identity at Work: Integrating Personal Creativity Within Your Professional Role","authors":["Oana Velcu-Laitinen"],"pages":"360","publication_date":"October 2022","description":"According to the World Economic Forum, creativity is considered to be the third-most-important skill for employees, behind complex problem-solving and critical thinking.

From the 19th century, store owners emerged from small beginnings to set in train an industry that has seen some operators become nationally, even globally, dominant. Along the way, they turned retailing into an art, and then a science. Now retailers in emerging markets appear to be repeating the story all over again, except on a scale and at a speed beyond anything we have seen before.\n\nGiven all of this, it can be hard for those who work in retailing to accept that the industry as we know it is living on borrowed time, on the brink of transformation. There is now an urgency with which conventional store-based retailers must now act and the extent of the challenges this change represents in strategic, organizational, and above all, technological terms.\n\nReshaping Retail sets out the driving causes, current trends and consequences of a transformation in retail triggered by technology. The changes go far beyond making items available for sale on the internet. Starting by briefly setting the historical and business system contexts for retail and describe the role that technology has played in the creation of modern retail it then explains the underlying technological drivers behind the current revolution - radical changes in the capacity of both hardware and software, mobile telecommunications changes and the advances of the Internet.\n\nUltimately, success will hinge on more than competence; it will come down to a way of thinking. Customer-centricity will need to be valued not just by the store owner, as in the past, but also by all employees in the organization. It will need to become embedded in their daily tasks. The same applies to technology, which must be at the center of the organization and recognized as such by everyone.\n\nWith a combination of extensive desk and field research, interviews with leading retailers and technologists, together with the real world experience of practitioners in this area, Reshaping Retail will inspire and help store retailers to make the necessary transformation now to win in the new consumer driven world.","tags":["Business"]},{"id":"9781118794166","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"The Warren Buffett Way Workbook","authors":["Robert G.

Or Kenneth Lay like Lou Gerstner? Answer: They are, or were, leaders. Many would argue that tyrants, corrupt CEOs, and other abusers of power and authority are not leaders at all--at least not as the word is currently used. But, according to Barbara Kellerman, this assumption is dangerously naive. A provocative departure from conventional thinking, Bad Leadership compels us to see leadership in its entirety. Kellerman argues that the dark side of leadership--from rigidity and callousness to corruption and cruelty--is not an aberration. Rather, bad leadership is as ubiquitous as it is insidious--and so must be more carefully examined and better understood. Drawing on high-profile, contemporary examples--from Mary Meeker to David Koresh, Bill Clinton to Radovan Karadzic, Al Dunlap to Leona Helmsley--Kellerman explores seven primary types of bad leadership and dissects why and how leaders cross the line from good to bad. The book also illuminates the critical role of followers, revealing how they collaborate with, and sometimes even cause, bad leadership. Daring and counterintuitive, Bad Leadership makes clear that we need to face the dark side to become better leaders and followers ourselves. Barbara Kellerman is research director of the Center for Public Leadership and a lecturer in public policy at the Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781609948139","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Ice Cream Social","authors":["Brad Edmondson"],"pages":"304","publication_date":"January 2014","description":"Ben & Jerry’s has always been committed to an insanely ambitious three-part mission: making the world’s best ice cream, supporting progressive causes, and sharing the company’s success with all stakeholders: employees, suppliers, distributors, customers, cows, everybody.

Therefore they must use all the tools and techniques at their disposal to improve their chances of success.

Using techniques developed by governmental intelligence services and a wide range of recent case studies, quotations and anecdotes, the expert authors from the renowned Cass Business School show how to build success into any M&A situation.\n\nThe first edition of Intelligent M&A was written in 2006 and published in 2007.

But as incredible and powerful it is, the Office 2004 suite comes without a single page of printed instructions. That means you're left to forge your own path through its countless innovative and useful new features and tools--until now. Office 2004 for Mac: The Missing Manual is the manual that should have been in the box. It's the map that clearly and easily guides both beginners and veterans through this new suite. Mark H.

It's four books in one! According to Microsoft's own research, the average Office user taps into less than fifteen percent of the suite's features.

Because this isn't an authorized book, Walker, Tessler, and Berkowitz candidly point out which features are gems in the rough worthy of your focused attention--and which are junkware that you best continue to overlook.

For example, DGM shows how to use macroeconomic tools and a global framework to analyze the effects of:\n\nU.S. tariffs on China and China’s tariffs on the United States\n\nInfrastructure spending\n\nSpeculative capital outflows from nations under stress, such as Argentina and Turkey, and speculative capital inflows into safe-haven countries, such as Switzerland\n\nDemonetization in India\n\nSuccessfully fighting the opioid abuse problem in the United States\n\nBorder adjustment tax\n\nMonetary policies\n\nFiscal policies\n\nMarthinsen keeps readers visually engaged with the strategic use of figures, tables, charts, and illustrative exhibits.

This book, drawing on research from the BCG Henderson Institute over many years, provides a set of perspectives on how to thrive under adverse conditions and how to reinvent businesses for the changing context. Overcoming both of these challenges is necessary for leaders to build long-lasting companies.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy"]},{"id":"9781398606708","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Sustainable Human Resource Management","authors":["Dr. Rafal Sitko"],"pages":"344","publication_date":"February 2023","description":"Use this practical textbook to understand what sustainable HRM is, how to implement it and what the benefits are for employees, organizations, the environment and society.","tags":["Business","Human Resources"]},{"id":"9781484269367","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Beginning Microsoft 365 Collaboration Apps: Working in the Microsoft Cloud","authors":["Ralph Mercurio","Brian Merrill"],"pages":"388","publication_date":"June 2021","description":"Start making the most of the latest collaboration tools in Microsoft 365—including Teams, SharePoint, Power Apps, Power BI, Power Automate, Microsoft Groups, Office ProPlus, Yammer, Planner, Stream, Forms, and OneDrive.

It is now a vow many businesses make. However, the correlation between increasing customer satisfaction and increasing customer spending with your company is very weak, according to the authors. Their research finds that changes in customers’ satisfaction levels explain less than 1% of variation in a company’s share of category spending. Is customer satisfaction worth the cost? To find out, the authors investigated the relationship between customer satisfaction and business outcomes, gathering data from more than 100,000 consumers covering more than 300 brands. Although high customer satisfaction ratings are typically treated by managers as being universally good for business, the authors’ findings indicate that the benefits are not nearly so clear-cut. There is a downside to continuously devoting resources to raise customer satisfaction levels. Managers are rarely able to accurately quantify the cost associated with increasing customer satisfaction scores (for example, from 8.7 to 9.1 on a 10-point scale), nor are they able to determine precisely what such an increase is actually worth. It turns out the return on these investments is often trivial or even negative. Knowing a customer’s satisfaction level tells you little about how he or she will divide his or her spending among the different brands used. As a result, changes in customer satisfaction levels are unlikely to have a meaningful impact on the share of category spending customers allocate with your brand. Why? Single-brand loyalty, which was common in our parents’ and grandparents’ generations, has been replaced with loyalty to multiple brands in a category in many sectors. Because of this divided loyalty, more customers partially defect (in other words, they give more of their business to a competitor) than completely defect from a business or brand. As a result, improving customers’ share of spending with your brand tends to represent a far greater opportunity than efforts to improve customer retention. kThe measure that really matters, according to the authors, isn’t your percentage of delighted customers or promoters. What matters is the relative “rank” that your brand’s satisfaction level represents vis-àvis your competitors.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Sales","Customer Service"]},{"id":"53863MIT58426","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Using Scenario Planning to Reshape Strategy","authors":["Rafael Ramirez","Steve Churchhouse","Jonas Hoffman"],"pages":"7","publication_date":"July 2017","description":"In recent years, organizations have been caught off guard by economic volatility, unexpected political events, natural disasters, and disruptive innovations. In response, the authors note, executives are showing a new interest in scenario planning. Rather than tying their company’s future to a strategy geared to one set of events, executives are coming to the view that smart management benefits from a richer understanding of the present possibilities afforded from multiple views about possible futures. Scenario planning came to prominence following World War II and gained recognition in the corporate world in the late 1960s and early 1970s. While several different approaches to scenario planning have emerged since then, this article focuses specifically on the Oxford scenario planning approach. Rather than taking a probabilistic stance (that is, making predictions in percentage terms or as best-case/worst-case scenarios) or a normative stance (that is, envisioning what a future should look like), the Oxford scenario methodology is based on plausibility. By recognizing the part of uncertainty that is unpredictable and by actively exploring the sources of the turbulence and uncertainty, the goal is to iteratively and interactively generate new knowledge and insights to help organizations reperceive their circumstances. During periods of turbulence, unpredictable uncertainty, novelty, and ambiguity (what the authors refer to as TUNA conditions), organizations frequently experience serious challenges that threaten existing value chains, communities, and even whole fields of endeavor. Such conditions can be unsettling and destabilizing on many different levels. A core feature in the Oxford scenario planning approach is making a distinction between the immediate business environment an organization inhabits (where business transactions take place) and the broader environment, or context, in which it operates. Different organizations go about scenario planning in different ways — there is no cookie-cutter methodology, the authors write. This article examines two cases. The first case involves Rolls-Royce plc, a leading supplier of power systems for aircraft and the marine and energy markets; the second case looks at the Royal Society of Chemistry, a London, U.K.-based international organization involved in advancing the field of chemical sciences. In addition to showing how these organizations used scenario planning, the authors discuss the challenges and opportunities of scenario planning more broadly.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Strategic Thinking"]},{"id":"53863MIT57201","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"How Workplace Fairness Affects Employee Commitment","authors":["Matthias Seifert","Joel Brockner","Emily C.

Very few look at their asset base as a collective network; rather, they see their assets as standalone performers, have no strategy for the role each asset plays in the grand scheme of things, and, therefore, fail to invest in their network for the long term to generate more cash for the business, asset by asset.\n\nRedesigning Capex Strategy provides an effective—and almost painfully obvious—solution to some of the greatest missed opportunities happening in business today.\n\nIn this resource that will revolutionize your capex decision-making, globally renowned capex strategists Fredrik Weissenrieder and Daniel Lindén share their proven methodology for focusing on the entire range of potential strategies and cash flow outcomes for hundreds of scenarios across a multi-asset base.

It’s a radical transformation of how you allocate capital—and avoid throwing good money after bad.\n\nWith a capex strategy that accounts for each asset’s role as part of the asset network, there’s never a question about the best path forward.

Markowitz devised the idea in 1952.\n\nIn the past six decades, Markowitz has risen to international acclaim as the father of Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), with his evaluation of the impact of asset risk, diversification, and correlation in the risk-return tradeoff. In defending the idea that portfolio risk was essential to strategic asset growth, he showed the world how to invest for the long-run in the face of any economy.\n\nIn Risk Return Analysis, this groundbreaking four-book series, the legendary economist and Nobel Laureate returns to revisit his masterpiece theory, discuss its developments, and prove its vitality in the ever-changing global economy. Volume 2 picks up where the first volume left off, with Markowitz’s personal reflections and current strategies. In this volume, Markowitz focuses on the relationship between single-period choices—now—and longer run goals. He discusses dynamic systems and models, the asset allocation “glide-path,” inter-generational investment needs, and financial decision support systems.\n\nWritten with both the academic and the practitioner in mind, this richly illustrated volume provides investors, economists, and financial advisors with a refined look at MPT, highlighting the rational decision-making and probability beliefs that are essential to creating and maintaining a successful portfolio today.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Financial Markets","Securities"]},{"id":"9780133597479","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"How to Manage Your Finances (Collection)","authors":["Liz Weston"],"pages":"465","publication_date":"August 2013","description":"In Your Credit Score: How to Improve the 3-Digit Number That Shapes Your Financial Future,fourth edition, Weston thoroughly covers brand-new laws changing everything from how your credit score can be used to how you can communicate with collectors.

Our approach is to introduce theoretical frameworks from management science to guide decision making about HR technology. These theoretical approaches provide a scientific basis and structure to analyze business challenges and improve decision making compared with using intuition alone or relying on vendor best practices. The theories and frameworks come from strategic management, economics, accounting, finance, organizational behavior, and information systems.

It examines the principles of option pricing in detail via standard binomial and stochastic calculus models. Developing the requisite mathematical background as needed, the text presents an introduction to probability theory and stochastic calculus suitable for undergraduate students in mathematics, economics, and finance.\n\nThe first nine chapters of the book describe option valuation techniques in discrete time, focusing on the binomial model. The author shows how the binomial model offers a practical method for pricing options using relatively elementary mathematical tools. The binomial model also enables a clear, concrete exposition of fundamental principles of finance, such as arbitrage and hedging, without the distraction of complex mathematical constructs. The remaining chapters illustrate the theory in continuous time, with an emphasis on the more mathematically sophisticated Black-Scholes-Merton model.\n\nLargely self-contained, this classroom-tested text offers a sound introduction to applied probability through a mathematical finance perspective. Numerous examples and exercises help students gain expertise with financial calculus methods and increase their general mathematical sophistication. The exercises range from routine applications to spreadsheet projects to the pricing of a variety of complex financial instruments.

Although usage-based linguistics emphasizes the centrality of the discourse context for language usage and cognition, this insight has not been fully integrated into the investigation of processes of grammatical variation and change. The structuralist heritage as well as corpus linguistic methodologies have favoured de-contextualized analytical perspectives on contemporary and historical language data and on the mechanisms and processes guiding grammatical variation and change. From a range of different perspectives, the contributions to this volume take up the challenge of contextualization in the investigation of grammatical variation and change in different stages of English language history and discuss central theoretical notions such as gradable grammaticality, motivation in hypervariation, and hypercharacterization. The book will be relevant to students and linguists working in the field of diachronic and variational linguistics and English language history.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Communication","English & Prose"]},{"id":"9781609945534","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Innovation Paradox","authors":["Tony Davila","Marc Epstein"],"pages":"240","publication_date":"June 2014","description":"Related skill:","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Innovation"]},{"id":"9780132119856","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Recruiting with Social Media: Social Media’s Impact on Recruitment and HR","authors":["Raj Anand"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"August 2010","description":"Social media can transform the way you recruit.

It is designed to be a provocative piece, but one that solidifies the intellectual framework around an emerging concept--strategic CSR.The foundation for these principles comes from my perspective as a management professor within the business school. As such, it is a pragmatic philosophy, oriented around stakeholder theory, that is designed to persuade business leaders who are skeptical of existing definitions and organizing principles of CSR, sustainability, or business ethics. It is also designed to stimulate thought within the community of intellectuals and business school administrators committed to these issues, but who approach them from more traditional perspectives. Ultimately, therefore, the purpose of the strategic CSR concept (and this book) is radical--it aims to redefine both business education and business practice. By building a theory that defines CSR as core to business operations and value creation (as opposed to peripheral practices that can be marginalized within the firm), these defining principles become applicable across the range of operational functions. As such, they redefine how businesses approach these functions in practice, but also redefine how these subjects should be taught in business schools.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Business Architecture"]},{"id":"9781633697676","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Alive at Work","authors":["Daniel M.

It discusses how these contexts determined their applications of the principles and practice of effective, but amoral leadership, and whether these lessons can be applied to legitimate business enterprises.\n\nIn this book John Zinkin and Chris Bennett argue that defining a \"crime\" is a contested issue and that criminality can be viewed as a spectrum, comprising a range of different types of crimes, the harms caused, and the variety of punishments involved. They discuss the critical role of the state in determining where criminality is perceived to sit on the crime continuum.\n\nThe authors delve into how the state and organized crime are natural competitors, and how organized crime and legitimate businesses are subject to many of the same internal and external strategic considerations. They contend that the resulting similarities between criminality in organized criminal organizations and legitimate businesses are greater than the differences and that the differences are only in degree and not in kind.\n\nThis thought-provoking study of criminality will be of immense interest to professionals, coaches, consultants, and academics interested in the techniques and ethics of leadership. The book is, in effect, the result of an intellectual journey of the authors from the ideas presented in their earlier book, The Principles and Practice of Effective Leadership, to the issues in this book discussing important, difficult, and contested subjects.

They also show how these pioneers are disrupting existing industries, value chains, and business models--and in the process creating fast-growing markets around the world.By understanding these entrepreneurs' mindsets and strategies, you gain vital insights into future market opportunities for your own organization. Providing a first-hand, on-the-ground look at a new breed of entrepreneur, this book reveals how apparently unreasonable innovators have built their enterprises, how their work will shape risks and opportunities in the coming years, and what tomorrow's leaders can learn from them.Start investing in, partnering with, and learning from these world-shaping change agents, and you position yourself to not only survive but also thrive in the new business landscape they're helping to define.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Innovation"]},{"id":"9780137001422","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"The Truth About Recruiting the Best Job Candidates: The Essential Truths in 20 Minutes","authors":["Cathy Fyock"],"pages":"42","publication_date":"September 2007","description":"“Talent matters.

It is timeless virtue that creates sustainable value.\n\nThoughtful leaders are keenly aware of the enormous challenge they face to drive high performance in a world that continues to ratchet up pressure and uncertainty. Some leaders respond by getting tough and establishing strict rules. They get people in line, but they don’t inspire excellence. Wise leaders, on the other hand, help their people practice character to navigate their way through the turbulence—without lowering performance expectations. As a result, their people are more reliable under pressure.\n\nException to the Rule links ancient wisdom with contemporary science on high performance, teamwork, and engagement. Building an organizational culture based on classical virtues– of trust, compassion, courage, justice, wisdom, temperance and hope - is both strategically smart and a better way to live.\n\nException to the Rule walks you through the steps of helping everyone in your organization focus on character defined by virtue. The word virtue means excellence, which is why each one is essential to help people perform at a high level despite uncertainty and pressure. Under character--based leadership, teams work better together, creativity flourishes and engagement increases.\n\nThe most powerful idea of Exception to the Rule is this: character defined by virtue is not based on birthright; it can be learned and practiced. Everyone can develop habits to become better than they were. While character cannot be legislated, character can be cultivated.\n\nAs virtue proves its value, the culture you have can evolve into the culture you need.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781118421284","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Wiley GAAP 2013: Interpretation and Application of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles","authors":["Joanne M.

It focuses on the importance of the nature of the language of the political discourse on sustainability and how ideas are communicated amongst the actors and stakeholders in the policy making process, as well as assessing the conceptual, political, institutional and operational barriers apparent across the European geographic region. Drawing case studies from numerous policy areas including climate change, EU emissions trading scheme, renewable energy, nuclear energy, the European integrated energy market, transport mobility, and environmental protection, expert contributors unveil a narrowing of the discourse on sustainability that has taken place in Europe. However, a considerable discontinuity remains between the economic and environmental objectives of sustainable development, and the authors argue that it is essential that conditions for a dynamic discourse, open to multiple participants, are developed.\n\nSustainable Development and Governance in Europe will be of strong interest to students and scholars of comparative politics, governance, sustainable development and environmental politics and studies.","tags":["Business","Operations","Green Business Practices"]},{"id":"9781906465438","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Liquid Leadership: Inspirational lessons from the world's great leaders","authors":["Damian Hughes"],"pages":"200","publication_date":"June 2009","description":"A practical, jargon-free and easily accessible book on making a difference as a leader, Damian Hughes’ Liquid Leadership draws on a diverse list of leaders in everyday life (Kim England, National Sales Training Manager at Unilever), to showbiz celebrities (John Lennon, Walt Disney), to renowned historical leaders (Shackleton, Eisenhower, Steve Jobs). \n\nThere are no stuffy theories here.

Their huge scale and international reach, they claim, make them more efficient and profitable, better able to deliver value, and an uncontested boon for the job market. According to the big boys, locally owned small businesses are simply quaint remnants of the past, unable to compete in the global economy.But in The Small-Mart Revolution, Michael Shuman shows that the benefits these mega-stores and huge corporations supposedly deliver to communities are illusory. Crunch the numbers and you'll find that locally owned businesses turn out to be much more reliable generators of good jobs, economic growth, tax dollars, community wealth, charitable contributions, social stability, and political participation. Unlike their global competitors, they do this without massive tax breaks and subsidies that often put local economies in a permanent hole. Plus, contrary to popular belief, local businesses are competitive with the multinationals--and gaining ground every day. Shuman highlights numerous trends that are making the old \"bigger is better\" economies of scale argument obsolete, and he describes a variety of innovative strategies these businesses are using to successfully compete with their over-sized competitors. He also shows how consumers, investors, and policymakers can support their own communities by \"going local.\" The Small-Mart Revolution offers a robust alternative to \"go-go\" globalization, one that nurtures the creative capacities of local businesses and enables communities everywhere to thrive.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Market Segmentation & Pricing"]},{"id":"9780415507288","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Business of Digital Publishing","authors":["Frania Hall"],"pages":"194","publication_date":"June 2013","description":"Responding to the growth of digital products and the commercial imperative to build new digital businesses, The Business of Digital Publishing offers a comprehensive introduction to the development of digital products in the book and journal industries.\n\nThis textbook provides background to the main technological development that have influenced the growth of digital publishing, introducing students to the key terms and concepts that make digital publishing possible.\n\nExploring four key publishing sectors: professional reference, academic, education and consumer, this book explains the context for the digital developments in each area and looks at the growth of new business models and the future challenges faced by each sector.\n\nIt also addresses the key issues that face the industry as a whole, outlining current debates, such as pricing and copyright, and exploring their impact on the industry through relevant case studies.\n\nThe Business of Digital Publishing is an invaluable resource for any publishing student looking for a starting point from which to explore the world of digital publishing.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Digital Transformation"]},{"id":"9781118555002","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Manager and the Monk: A Discourse on Prayer, Profit, and Principles","authors":["Jochen Zeitz","Anselm Grun"],"pages":"208","publication_date":"April 2013","description":"An exploration of spirituality, values, and sustainability in business\n\nWhen Jochen Zeitz and Anselm Grün first met onstage as \"the manager and the monk,\" Zeitz was CEO and Chairman of Puma, and Father Grün was a monk serving as cellarer, the business manager of his Benedictine abbey.

Global financial institutions teetered and fell, while at once-mighty U.S. companies, panicked CEOs slashed jobs. The financial chaos inflicted catastrophic damage: double-digit unemployment; crashing house and stock prices; federal budget deficits in the trillions, and a wider gap between the country’s haves and have-nots. Today many Americans still feel shell-shocked. But while there remains much to be nervous and frustrated about, it is impressive how much progress has been made in righting the wrongs that got us into this mess. The economy is growing and steadily creating jobs; house prices are stable and stock prices are up; debt burdens have eased for most households and the financial system has shored up its foundations to an impressive degree. American companies are as competitive globally as they have been in a half century. This dramatic turn in the economy’s fortunes occurred because of what government did to stem the financial panic and combat the effects of Great Recession. Policymakers’ unprecedented actions – from Congress’ auto and bank bailouts and fiscal stimulus, to the Federal Reserve’s zero interest rates and quantitative easing – remain intensely controversial, but ultimately they will be judged a success. Serious problems remain, including the government’s mounting debt load and a burgeoning number of disenfranchised workers, but we are on our way to addressing them. Our economic future has arguably never been brighter.","tags":["Business","Economics"]},{"id":"0131531182","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Nightly Business Report Presents Lasting Leadership: What You Can Learn from the Top 25 Business People of our Times","authors":["Mukul Pandya","Robbie Shell","Susan Warner"],"pages":"288","publication_date":"October 2004","description":"Paths to greatness: Actionable lessons from today's most remarkable business leaders\n\nIncisive profiles from Knowledge@Wharton and Nightly Business Report\n\nAndy Grove, Mary Kay Ash, Lou Gerstner, Richard Branson, Herb Kelleher, Charles Schwab... and 19 more\n\nIn this book, two of the world's most respected sources of business insight come together to select and profile the 25 most influential businesspeople of the past quarter century.

At the urging of citizens, nongovernmental organizations, and industry, government officials at all levels have experimented with collaboration. Yet questions remain about the roles that governments play in collaboration--whether they are constructive and support collaboration, or introduce barriers. This thoughtful book analyzes a series of cases to understand how collaborative processes work and whether government can be an equal partner even as government agencies often formally control decision making and are held accountable for the outcomes. Looking at examples where government has led, encouraged, or followed in collaboration, the authors assess how governmental actors and institutions affected the way issues were defined, the resources available for collaboration, and the organizational processes and structures that were established. Cases include collaborative efforts to manage watersheds, rivers, estuaries, farmland, endangered species habitats, and forests. The authors develop a new theoretical framework and demonstrate that government left a heavy imprint in each of the efforts. The work concludes by discussing the choices and challenges faced by governmental institutions and actors as they try to realize the potential of collaborative environmental management.","tags":["Business","Operations","Green Business Practices"]},{"id":"9781647826161","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Press Play","authors":["Bastian Bergmann"],"pages":"192","publication_date":"September 2025","description":"An eye-opening look at the rapidly rising growth of gaming and the companies—including Peloton, Burberry, the New York Times, BMW, and Chipotle—that are using games to win over customers.\n\nToday's consumers demand more than products—they crave immersive, personalized experiences.

Regardless of their titles and nominal responsibilities, they will confront situations in which they have insufficient influence and authority to get their job done effectively. Fortunately, two strategies can almost always help the sidelined executive capture more clout and build an enduring power base.A variety of situations can lead a manager into a power deficit. Demographics (race, ethnicity, gender or age) can contribute to the power-deficient executive’s predicament, as can inexperience, poor reputation, personality, background, training or outlook. It can happen to people with high potential. It can even happen to executives who are already high performers.Typically, an executive winds up with a power deficit because he or she lacks one or more of the following power sources: legitimacy, critical resources or networks. The high level of interaction between these three sources of power means that a shortage in one can easily produce shortages in the other two.The authors argue that, generally, executives who have a power deficit can solve the problem in one of two ways: they must either play the game more effectively or change the game by, for instance, reshaping their role in the organization. The authors offer examples and recommendations and provide a short questionnaire to help managers identify potential power deficits.The good news is that the odds of success are good. The authors report that in their coaching work with 179 executives who wrestled with power deficits, only four failed to improve the situation.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9780132553872","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Simple Strategies for Developing and Writing Effective E-Newsletters","authors":["Natalie Canavor","Claire Meirowitz"],"pages":"6","publication_date":"March 2010","description":"This Element is an excerpt from The Truth About the New Rules of Business Writing (9780137153152) by Natalie Canavor and Claire Meirowitz.

If you've just been promoted, how do you handle the tensions of managing former peers? And what are the telltale mental signs that it's time to start planning your next career move?\n\nWe know that psychology can teach us much about behaviors and challenges relevant to work, such as making better decisions, influencing people, and dealing with stress. But many popular books on these topics analyze them as universal human phenomena without providing real-life, constructive career help.\n\nBring Your Brain to Work changes all that. Professor, author, and popular radio host Art Markman focuses on three essential elements of a successful career--getting a job, excelling at work, and finding your next position--and expertly illustrates how cognitive science, especially psychology, sheds fascinating and useful light on each of these elements.\n\nTo succeed at a job interview, for example, you need to understand the mindset of the interviewer and know how to come across as exactly the individual the company wants to hire. To keep that job, it's critical to master the mental challenge of learning every day. Finally, careers require constant development, so you need to be able to sense when it's time to move up or out and to prepare yourself for the move. So many of the hurdles you face throughout your career are, first and foremost, psychological challenges, and Markman shows you how to use your different mental systems--motivational, social, and cognitive--to manage them more effectively.\n\nIntegrating the latest research with engaging stories and examples from across the professional spectrum, Bring Your Brain to Work gets inside your head, helping you to succeed through a better understanding of yourself and those around you.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Development"]},{"id":"9780415621083","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Project Development in the Solar Industry","authors":["Albie Fong","Jesse Tippett"],"pages":"250","publication_date":"December 2012","description":"This book provides an extensive overview of utility scale  solar  project  development  and  the  various tasks  required  to  bring  large  solar  power  plants from plans to realities.

These ingredients are axiomatized in modern decision theory in the view to obtain a formally and empirically tractable representation of the decision-maker. The main issue developed in this book is the connection between realistic and testable psychological features and the descriptive component of abstract axioms of rationality. It addresses three main topics for which the interaction between axiomatization and psychology leads to potential new developments in experimental decision-theory and puts strictures on the standard revealed preference methodology prevailing in that field. The possibility of a cardinal representation of preferences is discussed. Different ways of accounting for incomplete preferences, and in which sense, are analysed. Finally, the conditions of separability between preferences and beliefs, such as prescribed by axioms of state-independence, are submitted to actual and potential tests. The book offers a bridge between the disciplines of decision-theory, psychology, and neuroeconomics. It is thus relevant for those, in psychology and cognitive sciences, who are sometimes put off by the high degree of formalism and abstraction in decision-theory, that seems to lie beyond the reach of psychological realism. It also aims to convince those in decision-theory for whom psychological realism and empirical testability should not constrain the modelling enterprise that conceptual clarification can come from attempted experimentation.\n\nAddresses open and evolving theoretical issues in decision-theory, especially from experimental perspectives\nHelps researchers understand the psychological and neuroscientific mechanisms for decision-making\nConsiders how preferences shape beliefs and how beliefs shape preferences\nUncovers the very formal and abstract psychological and behavioral implications that are actually made in contemporary decision-theory","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Development","Critical Thinking"]},{"id":"9781398621619","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"How to Deal with Difficult People, 6th Edition","authors":["Roy Lilley"],"pages":"168","publication_date":"May 2025","description":"Gain essential skills for career development with this pocket guide to handling the hardest kinds of people, including tricky customers, challenging co-workers and bad bosses.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Sales","Customer Service"]},{"id":"9781422187180","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Forget a Mentor, Find a Sponsor","authors":["Sylvia Ann Hewlett"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"August 2013","description":"Who’s pulling for you?

Yet history proves that a new generation of success stories will likely emerge from this era of financial chaos. And this new book prepares you to be one of those success stories by analyzing the inner qualities that have propelled the forward-thinking leaders of our time: drive, determination, and self-awareness.\n\nAs strategists for the internationally renowned consumer and political research firm Penn, Schoen & Berland Associates, Michael Berland and Douglas Schoen are experts in how successful people think . . . and how they win. Now they share what they've learned with firsthand accounts from some of the world's most successful people in nearly every field—including the founder of Starwood Resorts; a world-famous chef-restaurateur; the CEO of NBC Universal; a supermodel turned entrepreneur; the head of Estée Lauder; the commissioner of the National Hockey League; the president of Hearst Magazines; and the creator of CBS's 60 Minutes. Berland and Schoen have discovered that true success is about more than \"winning.\" True success has an emotional quotient: it's about determining your innate strengths, deciding what you truly want, and striving tirelessly to achieve it.\n\nBerland and Schoen describe the five archteypes of success: visionaries, natural-born leaders, do-gooders, independence seekers, and independents who follow their dreams. In this unprecedented collection of stories from some of the most successful people in fashion, sports, entertainment, and business, Schoen and Berland demonstrate that success isn't about changing who you are; rather, it's about figuring out what makes you tick—and leveraging that knowledge to your advantage. This book shows through compelling first-person storytelling that the most successful people understand their own natural abilities and how to use their best qualities to create a fulfilling life—and then tells you how to do the same.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9783110759983","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Work–Family Triangle Synchronization","authors":["Anat Garti","Shay Tzafrir"],"pages":"142","publication_date":"September 2022","description":"\"I need to check with my partner\" is a common response of an employee to his manager, emphasizing the tug of war between the employee’s spouse and the workplace.\n\nThe challenges in the fields of work and family have been the focus of researchers for decades. Frameworks for work–family conflict, work–family enrichment, and work–family balance have been put forth in light of the complexity of the interface. Yet the relationship between the three stakeholders managing the interface (manager, employee, and spouse), has not received the attention it deserves.\n\nWork–Family Triangle Synchronization takes a holistic look into the triangle of forces involved in the conflict: the manager, the employee, and the employee’s spouse at home. Using the therapeutic triangle relationship framework, it elaborates on the dynamic of work–family triangles and offers a structured process for designing a psychological contract among the three players. This process is termed work–family triangle synchronization (WFTS).\n\nBased on the authors’ 20 years of academic research and field experience in the organizational and family domains this book introduces a novel synchronization model, methodology, and compelling tools. Personal anecdotes and stories make the text accessible and understandable, accompanying the reader step by step in the task of developing a synchronized work–family triangle psychological contract, as both a diagnostic and a management tool.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Development","Life-Work Balance"]},{"id":"9781119793427","language":"en","level":"Beginner to intermediate","title":"Valuing Businesses Using Regression Analysis","authors":["C.

Knowledge management has become a key strategic asset for the twenty-first- century economy and for every organization that values knowledge it must invest in developing the best strategy for identifying, developing, and applying the knowledge assets it needs to succeed; it must strive to become a learning organization. This book demonstrates how the effective capture, dissemination, and management of knowledge throughout an organization can make it more competitive. In the book, the author discusses the importance of transforming traditional organizations into learning organizations—entities that foster a culture of continuous learning so that external change in all its facets can be recognized when it happens and internal change can be effected and managed when necessary. This book includes cases and lessons from leading world organizations that invested in knowledge management in order to remain competitive, and it offers strategies and guidance to organizational leaders who endeavor to deliver heightened value to all their stakeholders while eliminating the learning “disabilities” that threaten corporate productivity and success. To remain competitive every organization must invest in creating and implementing the best knowledge networks, processes, methods, tools, and technologies. This will enable them to learn, create new knowledge, and apply the best knowledge much faster.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Business Architecture"]},{"id":"9781422163757","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Giving Feedback: Expert Solutions to Everyday Challenges","authors":["Harvard Business School Press"],"pages":"96","publication_date":"December 2006","description":"Good feedback is essential to helping employees perform better at work.

Backed by rock-solid science published in the Harvard Business Review and MIT Sloan Management Review, this landmark book introduces a new and rigorously tested approach—the Wallet Allocation Rule—that is proven to link to the most important measure of customer loyalty: share of wallet.\n\nCompanies currently spend billions of dollars each year measuring and managing metrics like customer satisfaction and Net Promoter Score (NPS) to improve customer loyalty. These metrics, however, have almost no correlation to share of wallet. As a result, the returns on investments designed to improve the customer experience are frequently near zero, even negative.\n\nWith The Wallet Allocation Rule, managers finally have the missing link to business growth within their grasp—the ability to link their existing metrics to the share of spending that customers allocate to their brands.\n\nLearn why improving satisfaction (or NPS) does not improve share.\nApply the Wallet Allocation Rule to discover what really drives customer spending.\nUncover new metrics that really matter to achieve growth.\n\nBy applying the Wallet Allocation Rule, managers get real insight into the money they currently get from their customers, the money available to be earned by them, and what it takes to get it.

Eisenhardt","Nathan R. Furr","Christopher B. Bingham"],"pages":"7","publication_date":"October 2014","description":"Capturing new growth opportunities is fundamental to strategy, innovation and entrepreneurship. These days, experimentation and improvisational change are in. But how should managers address the challenge? The answer, the authors argue, can be more complex and more crucial to a company’s success than previously thought. Their research on mature corporations, growing businesses and new ventures suggests a paradoxical tension between focus and flexibility that can define or break a business. Based on more than 150 interviews with managers at 30 companies in North America, Europe and Asia, the authors conclude that focus is still critical and may be just as important as flexibility. What’s more, they conclude that a company’s focus may influence its flexibility and vice versa.There are two components to capturing a new business opportunity: opportunity selection and opportunity execution. Opportunity selection involves determining which customer problem to solve, whereas opportunity execution deals with solving the problem. The authors point out that most books, articles and thought leaders focus on opportunity execution — how to create value by developing solutions. But research suggests that innovation initiatives often move so quickly to identify a solution that the innovators have to cycle back to figure out which problem they are actually solving. The authors found that opportunity selection appears to matter as much as opportunity execution. More importantly, how managers approach opportunity selection (whether with flexibility or with focus) has a critical impact on how successful they are at opportunity execution.The authors observed that managers and entrepreneurs tend to fall into two groups: opportunists and strategists. Opportunists rely on a less scripted and more flexible approach to opportunity selection, letting emergent customer inquiries shape opportunity selection. Strategists follow a different pattern. They constrain the selection of opportunities so that they pursue opportunities that are more likely to result in success, and they try to capture several opportunities in a row versus one in isolation. The authors found that companies that were more focused in opportunity selection were often more flexible in opportunity execution.","tags":["Business"]},{"id":"53863MIT62410","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Courage to Be Candid","authors":["Jim Detert","Evan Bruno"],"pages":"10","publication_date":"June 2021","description":"Behaviors that spark organizational learning and growth also require a great deal of courage — often because they involve speaking truth to power or challenging one’s sense of self.

Suarez"],"pages":"7","publication_date":"January 2015","description":"Category labels are not the same as company brand. Brands create unique relationships between customers and your particular company. Category labels, however, are a way to identify a product’s commonality with others of its type. For example, Tesla Motors markets and maintains its distinctive “Tesla” brand, but the category label the company uses to introduce its products is “electric cars.” Categories, like brands, matter in ways that are subtle and profound.\n\nNew industries are characterized by an early period of confusion and uncertainty about product use and meaning. The industry that we know today as “cloud computing” started decades ago under labels such as “utility computing,” “time sharing,” “application services provider,” and “software as a service.” While the category label “smartphone” is ubiquitous today, in the late 1990s, Samsung once called a product of that type a “camera phone,” others called it a “PDA phone” and Nokia called it a “gaming deck.”\n\nContrary to popular opinion in the business press, the first-mover advantage of entering a new market very early can be a disadvantage. But when should companies launch a product in a nascent industry? In a nascent industry or sector, the introduction of the dominant category label marks the start point of the ideal window of opportunity for entry. Before the introduction of the dominant category label, most consumers are reluctant to commit, which often results in a difficult time period for early-entry producers, who must try to convince customers to try their products. The end point of the ideal window for entry is the introduction of a dominant product design into the market; after that, companies need to conform to customers’ expectations for the product category.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing"]},{"id":"53863MIT58104","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Tackling the World's Challenges With Technology","authors":["Andrew S.

Ross"],"pages":"9","publication_date":"January 2016","description":"Today’s rapid technological changes have transformed the role of global IT outsourcing in companies’ strategies. Traditionally viewed as a cost-saving measure, IT outsourcing is also increasingly being leveraged as a strategic tool for acquiring cutting-edge innovation. This pursuit of emerging technologies and capabilities, however, has elevated the complexity of managing supplier portfolios. In this article, the authors introduce the “long-tail” strategy, an innovative IT outsourcing model that combines a few key partnerships with a dynamically changing number of smaller contracts with other suppliers that can deliver specific value propositions beyond the capabilities of the key partners.\n\nRepresenting a dynamic, diversified, yet disciplined approach toward outsourcing, the long-tail strategy embraces and even fosters a flow of new suppliers, so companies are continually acquiring new capabilities that enable them to prosper in turbulent business environments. The authors’ extensive in-depth interviews with major companies in financial services, business services, technology, manufacturing, and energy suggest that the long-tail strategy can help diverse organizations achieve their business goals. For example, the long-tail strategy helped a major global bank establish and maintain technological leadership in the financial-services industry, and allowed Toyota Motor North America to realize rapid innovation.\n\nIn order to implement the long-tail strategy successfully, companies should institute five key practices: (1) distributing responsibility within the company for scanning for new technologies; (2) nurturing relationships with new “long-tail” suppliers; (3) encouraging sales pitches from suppliers; (4) governing the entire outsourcing portfolio; and (5) designing for integration. When implementing these practices, organizations should seek to create a more proactive, entrepreneurial, and dynamic culture in IT outsourcing. If executed well, the long-tail strategy can transform IT outsourcing into a driver of innovation and value creation in an age of globalization and digitization.","tags":["Business","Operations"]},{"id":"53863MIT60206","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Truth About Behavioral Change","authors":["Damon Centola","Tayler Lord"],"pages":"10","publication_date":"December 2018","description":"In this article drawn from his new book, How Behavior Spreads, UPenn professor Damon Centola explains how the thinking about social networks is changing.

Woerner","Peter Weill","Martin Mocker"],"pages":"9","publication_date":"July 2014","description":"As businesses have entered new geographies, developed new products, opened new channels and added more granular customer segments, they have made their offerings more complex with the intention of adding value. But, as a seemingly inevitable consequence, companies also have made it more difficult for customers to interact with them and more unwieldy for their employees to get things done. For organizations, there has thus been a trade-off between good and bad complexity. In the digital economy, however, companies can finesse this trade-off and increase value-adding complexity in their offerings while keeping processes simple for customers and employees. Consider Amazon.com Inc.’s 10 million products, which create value without confusing customers, thanks to simple customer-facing processes that use digital tools such as search, recommendations, customer reviews and seller ratings to help site users choose among the many available products. Another example is Royal Phillips, which uses and reuses digitized platforms — and is able to offer locally differentiated products in 60 categories in more than 100 countries. The authors explain how companies can achieve their “complexity sweet spot” in the digital age — that is, the maximum value from varied and integrated product offerings with the simplest processes. The authors’ research suggests that companies operating in this complexity sweet spot outperform their industry competitors on profitability. There are several routes to the sweet spot. One of the biggest decisions is who will lead and manage a company’s complexity, as no one executive (save the CEO) really oversees all product and service development and operations. Whoever is leading a company’s search for the complexity sweet spot needs to lead a cultural change to embed complexity management into the company’s DNA. The good news, according to the authors, is that there are almost always quick wins, and the rewards are, well, sweet.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Digital Transformation"]},{"id":"53863MIT56118","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"The Upside to Large Competitors","authors":["Jill J.

One of her colleagues had just been promoted and, although the guy who got it was good, she didn't think he was any better than her. Well, except at one thing, he was always playing politics - sucking up to the more senior guys and volunteering to be on any committee going.\n\nDebra knew the type - went to the same school, belonged to the same club - she didn't have a hope against the kind of connections he had so she might as well give up. It seemed doing a good job just wasn't enough around here.\n\nDebra and Johann work in an environment with multiple and complex reporting lines - in other words, a matrix. There's room to \"slip between the cracks\" - if a person wants to take advantage of confusion over who is managing performance; or if they can't make the necessary transition to self-management. Communication can be difficult even when there is an apparently shared language.\n\nRead how Johann and Debra work together to identify the skills needed to succeed in a matrix, and how using Emotional Intelligence (EI) can develop specific behaviours you can incorporate in your daily job. The result will help reduce stress and increase your chances of success.\n\nDawn Metcalfe, Managing Director of PDS, based in Dubai, uses her experience as a coach and trainer to give us a behind the curtain look at how mentoring can help an individual develop the skills they need to survive and thrive in today's complex work environments.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9780071790512","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Winning with Transglobal Leadership: How to Find and Develop Top Global Talent to Build World-Class Organizations","authors":["Linda D.

But today, companies surge ahead, fall behind, or even disappear in mere months. If you and your company are going to thrive for the long run, you need to continuously evolve, change, and stay a step ahead of your competition.\n\nThe ability to see and capitalize on new opportunities is the cornerstone of agility. Successful technology-based firms like Google, Tesla,  and Amazon have all mastered agility within their core business practices, but companies in any sector can—and must—learn to spot new opportunities and make the right choices about what to invest in, what to change, and what to abandon.\n\nThe Agility Advantage first shows how to identify those aspects of your business where agility is most crucial—where the business environment is changing fast—and which elements have the  greatest impact on the customer’s decision to buy. Amanda Setili then shows how to master the three components of agility:\n\nMarket agility: Gain ideas from your most demanding and forward-thinking customers and from outside your industry.  Engage, observe, and mix with customers to identify the opportunities created by their changing demands.\nDecision agility: Anticipate the changes that may affect you and turn even troubling trends into opportunities. Design your strategy to maximize learning and to manage risk.  Generate diverse alternatives and make fast, fact-based decisions about which to pursue.\nExecution agility:   Build new capabilities, shed what doesn’t fit, and take the first steps in a new direction. Experiment, then reinforce and build on what works. Enlist and inspire your organization around a compelling purpose and grant employees the autonomy and resources to continuously adapt and adjust course.  \n\nThe future will present more opportunities but narrower windows to capture them. With a wealth of valuable information and practical strategies, The Agility Advantage is essential reading to help any organization adapt and thrive—both today and tomorrow.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy"]},{"id":"9781118966907","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Stacking the Deck: How to Lead Breakthrough Change Against Any Odds","authors":["David S. Pottruck"],"pages":"256","publication_date":"October 2014","description":"Change is a constant, and leaders must do more than keep up—they must innovate and accelerate to succeed. Yet people are often unnerved by change. As a leader during a time of transformation, you may stand up before teams that are indifferent, or even hostile, and need to convince them that change is necessary and urgent. More than money, time, or resources, the ability to lead these people determines your ultimate success or failure. What does it take to be an effective change leader and increase the odds of success?\n\nStacking the Deck offers a proven, practical approach for inspiring meaningful, lasting change across an organization. Stacking the Deck presents a nine-step course of action leaders can follow from the first realization that change is needed through all the steps of implementation, including assembling the right team of close advisors and getting the word out to the wider group.\n\nBased on Dave Pottruck's experiences leading change as CEO of Charles Schwab and later as chairman of CorpU and HighTower Advisors, these steps provide a guide to ensure that your change initiative and your team have the best possible shot at success. In addition, established business leaders who have led extraordinary change initiatives demonstrate the steps in action. These executives include eBay CEO John Donahoe, Wells Fargo former CEO Dick Kovacevich, Starbucks chief executive officer Howard Schultz, San Francisco Giants CEO Larry Baer, JetBlue CEO Dave Barger, Asurion CEO Steve Ellis, Pinkberry CEO Ron Graves, and Intel's President Renee James, among others.\n\nLeading an organization through major change—whether it's the introduction of a new product, an expansion to a new territory, or a difficult downsizing—is not for the faint of heart. While success is never guaranteed, the right leadership, process, and team make all the difference. For all leaders facing major change in their organizations, Stacking the Deck is an indispensable resource for putting the odds in your favor.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy"]},{"id":"9780749497330","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"The Young Entrepreneur","authors":["Swish Goswami","Quinn Underwood"],"pages":"240","publication_date":"May 2022","description":"Jump-start your entrepreneurial journey with this practical and inspirational guide to starting a business - without dropping out of your studies.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Entrepreneurship"]},{"id":"9781789661934","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Executive Engagement Strategies","authors":["Bev Burgess"],"pages":"264","publication_date":"March 2020","description":"Win the attention of high-level decision makers in large corporations; spark their interest and earn their trust to achieve long-term, sustainable mutual value.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9780749464202","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Campaign It!","authors":["Alan Barnard","Chris Parker"],"pages":"240","publication_date":"February 2012","description":"Campaign It! will improve the way you communicate and so enable you to achieve your desired outcomes more effectively and efficiently.","tags":["Business","Project & Product Management","Product Management","Communication Strategy"]},{"id":"9780749439644","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Applied Transport Economics, 3rd Edition","authors":["Stuart Cole"],"pages":"464","publication_date":"June 2005","description":"Revised and updated to cover developments and thinking in transport economics, Applied Transport Economics examines the application of economics techniques first, to commercial transport operations, second, to public policy issues and third, to the role of transport in its wider economic context.","tags":["Business","Economics"]},{"id":"9781843983255","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Employment Relations","authors":["Pauline Dibben","Geoffrey Wood","Gilton Klerck"],"pages":"400","publication_date":"February 2011","description":"Develop a thorough understanding of the theory and practice of employment relations in an international context.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Public Relations"]},{"id":"9781398603837","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Using Semiotics in Retail","authors":["Dr. Rachel Lawes"],"pages":"296","publication_date":"February 2022","description":"Boost sales, increase brand recognition and create engaging shopper experiences with this practical guide to applying semiotic insights to both online and in-store retail.","tags":["Business","Sales & Marketing","Sales"]},{"id":"9781398612730","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Omnichannel Retail, 2nd Edition","authors":["Tim Mason","Sarah Jarvis"],"pages":"256","publication_date":"September 2023","description":"The retail world is now more competitive than ever and to succeed, businesses must embrace an omnichannel approach.

They also include the distribution operations of retailers, manufacturers (for both new products and aftermarket parts) and distributors. These clusters attract companies for whom logistics is a critical element of their service offering or a large part of their overall costs. In recent years, logistics clusters have received support and funding from regional and national governments all across the world seeking to promote economic growth.\n\nLogistics clusters have the ability to address several challenges many economies face, including the pressing need for good jobs, higher levels of foreign trade and infrastructure renewal. In addition to helping companies navigate global supply networks, logistics clusters can lead the way in sustainable transportation and energy-efficient storage and transportation operations.

Many of these companies, however, have not adapted their products and operations sufficiently to succeed in these markets, and returns have often been mediocre. Even when managers think they are performing well in emerging markets, they often are not because they have set low expectations.\n\nAdapting products and operations requires obtaining and using good market intelligence, which is difficult in emerging markets due to the paucity and unreliability of information. Another factor is the wide heterogeneity of emerging markets compared to developed markets. A third common problem is a lack of shared responsibility for market intelligence between headquarters and country managers, so market intelligence that is collected either is dismissed as not credible or is not updated often enough to keep pace with the rate of change in emerging markets.\n\nThe authors argue that companies can overcome these difficulties by (1) treating market intelligence as a strategic asset; (2) organizing differently for market intelligence in emerging markets; and (3) using a wide range of sources and methods for market intelligence in emerging markets. They also recommend that market intelligence be organized as a shared responsibility between the corporate office and emerging-market business executives, with shared decision rights and shared resources.\n\nThe article includes examples illustrating how companies such as Wrigley, Unilever, and Procter & Gamble obtain market intelligence in emerging markets.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","International Business"]},{"id":"53863MIT60120","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Breaking Logjams in Knowledge Work","authors":["Nelson Repenning","Sheila Dodge","Don Kieffer"],"pages":"27","publication_date":"October 2018","description":"Despite the well-documented costs of overload, many leaders still think organizations thrive under pressure.

Leonard","Larry Bennigson"],"pages":"5","publication_date":"April 2013","description":"Boards of directors have two broad responsibilities on behalf of shareholders and other stakeholders, according to the authors: overseeing the protection of existing value and creating new value. Even though most boards take growth seriously, in practice board oversight has become unbalanced. The imbalance between board risk and opportunity oversight, the authors argue, is a potentially serious problem. Although risk-management advocates claim that their frameworks can accommodate risk and opportunity, the authors are skeptical of those claims. Ensuring the development of the company’s opportunity generating capability, they write, should be an integral part of the board’s role in value creation. In the board’s capacity as opportunity overseer, it should have a well-informed point of view about:•the company’s overall approach to recognizing and pursuing opportunities,•the current state of the enterprise’s opportunity-generating capability,•how that capability aligns with the enterprise’s strategic challenges, and•top management’s action plan for enhancing that capability.Correcting the imbalance in board oversight will require a concerted effort, because the orientation toward risk is so entrenched. “We are not simply referring to companies that stress innovation, make large R&D investments or are active in acquiring other businesses,” the authors write. “Rather, we mean the combined ability of organizational and management processes to search for, create, identify, develop and realize value-creating opportunities — reliably and consistently.” This requires an active, constructive partnership between the board and senior leadership — and a board that understands and monitors how the company achieves and maintains a high level of value-creating performance.Companies can attempt to build opportunity-generating capabilities internally (as Apple has done), acquire them (as Monsanto has done) or attempt some combination. Given the differences among enterprises, there are no simple models for effective opportunity oversight. In most cases, boards will need to develop their own tools and practices. Strengthening the opportunity oversight capabilities of boards will take time, according to the authors, as well as an opportunity-motivated CEO, enthusiastic board members and a board and senior executives willing and able to work in partnership.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy"]},{"id":"53863MIT63136","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Leadership as Craft","authors":["Mike Fisher","Chris Clearfield"],"pages":"6","publication_date":"August 2021","description":"In this installment of the MIT Sloan Management Review’s Leading With Impact series, Mike Fisher discusses his role as chief technology officer at online marketplace Etsy with coach and consultant Chris Clearfield.

The authors outline a simple strategic process for making businesses so highly attractive that perfect customers and clients are naturally drawn right to them.\n\nSound too good to be true?

If not, you're not alone. In fact, studies show that audiences remember only 10% to 30% of speech or presentation content. Given those bleak statistics, why do we give speeches at all? We give them, says communications expert Nick Morgan, because they remain the most powerful way of connecting with audiences since ancient Greek times. But as we've evolved to a more conversational mode of public speaking, thanks to television, we have forgotten much of what the Greeks taught us about the nonverbal aspects of speech-giving: the physical connection with audiences that can create an almost palpable emotional bond. Morgan says this \"kinesthetic connection\" comes from truly listening to your audience—not just with your brain but with your body. In this book, he draws from more than 20 years as a speech coach and consultant, combining the best of ancient Greek oratory with modern communications research to offer a new, audience-centered approach to public speaking. Through entertaining and insightful examples, Morgan illustrates a 3 part process—focusing on content development, rehearsal, and delivery—that will enable readers of all experience levels to give more effective, passion-filled speeches that move audiences to action.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Communication","Public Speaking"]},{"id":"9780132143615","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"How Great Products and Services Supply Great User Experiences","authors":["Robert Brunner","Stewart Emery","Russ Hall"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"February 2010","description":"This Element is an excerpt from Do You Matter?: How Great Design Will Make People Love Your Company (ISBN: 9780137142446) by Robert Brunner and Stewart Emery. Available in print and digital formats.\n\nHow to make sure customer experience permeates every corner of your company--and all your products and services.\n\nAs CEO, you’re so dedicated to customer experience that in 1985 when a line of your company’s refrigerators were found defective, you had workers smash 76 of them to smithereens.

But the central question for all managers - the one that separates great managers from the rest- is how to get the most from your people. What do you do when your most talented people fall short of their potential, or worse, fall off their game for awhile? How do you inspire a solid contributor to even more stellar performance? How do you find that spark? And turn it into a burning flame?According to best-selling author and psychiatrist, Ned Hallowell, it's all in the brain. Creating that spark and inspiring someone to perform at their highest levels isn't rocket science; but it is brain science, and it has yet to be codified into a simple and reliable process that all managers can use.Drawing from his expertise helping people reach their full potential and synthesizing the latest research on happiness, brain science, and performance, Hallowell does exactly that -- he offers a five step process that leads to peak performance. Based on the latest findings in the fast-moving field of high performance research and rooted in the work of Martin Seligman, Dan Gilbert, Marcus Buckingham, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, John Ratey, and many other experts in psychology and neuroscience, this book gives managers a simple and coherent framework for getting the best out of people:(1) Selection - how to put people in the right job, and give them the responsbilities that literally make their brains \"light up;\"(2) Connection - how to overcome the powerful forces that disconnect us interpersonally in today's workplace, and how to restore the positive connections that fuel superior performance;(3) Play - why play is essential to peak performance, and how managers can get it right;(4) Progress - when the pressure is on, how to challenge the right person at the right time;(5) Recognition - why reward systems always decrease peak performance, and how managers can finally get this rightThe value of the five steps is that each step builds on another. For instance, there's no point in challenging an employee to go beyond their personal best if you haven't bothered to ensure first that you've got them in the right job. And there's no way to successfully get someone to think more creatively if you haven't first established the personal connection with her so that she knows her wild ideas will be taken seriously. And there's no point in demanding more, if you haven't first given employees a chance to engage their imagination and play around with the things that \"light up their brains.\"Especially in times of mental overload and stress, when invoking people to suck it up or work even harder isn't an effective management tool, managers need a new game plan, like the one in this book, for helping their people perform at their best.","tags":["Business","Human Resources","Talent Management"]},{"id":"9780132657808","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Windows Phone 7 for iPhone Developers","authors":["Kevin Hoffman"],"pages":"336","publication_date":"July 2011","description":"Bring Your iPhone Apps and Skills to Windows Phone 7—or Build Apps for Both Mobile Platforms at Once\n\nIf you’ve been developing for the crowded iPhone marketplace, this book will help you leverage your iOS skills on a fast-growing new platform: Windows Phone 7 (WP7).

But how do you attract the best people? What do they really want? Based on his rigorous and extensive research, Mark Miller learned that top performers are looking for very different things than solid contributors. In Talent Magnet, Miller uses a clever and entertaining business fable to share these findings. He tells the parallel stories of Blake Brown, a CEO struggling with winning the war for talent, and Blake's sixteen-year-old son Clint, who is trying to get his first job so he can raise money to buy a well for a village in Africa. Blake reaches out to leaders in other industries and works with his team to solve the puzzle of making his organization a destination for exceptional performers. But he also learns from his son. Listening to Clint and his friends compare notes on the companies they've worked for that summer, ranging from the awful to the inspirational, Blake realizes they want the same three things out of a job as any top performer in a Fortune 500 company.Miller identifies these three critical aspects of a true talent magnet and explores the deeper meaning of each.

The most recent wave, the 5th takeover wave of the 1990s, was characterized by an unprecedented number of corporate restructurings in terms of mergers and acquisitions (M&As), public-to-private transactions, spin-offs and divestitures, and leveraged recapitalizations. Following the collapse of the stock market in March 2000, M&A activity slumped dramatically, but this pause ended in the second half of 2004 when takeover deals occurred again quite frequently. Indeed, some observers wonder whether the 6th takeover wave has started. The takeover wave in the 1990s was particularly remarkable in terms of size and geographical dispersion. For the first time, Continental European firms were as eager to participate as their US and UK counterparts, and M&A activity in Europe hit levels similar to those experienced in the US. Due to its financial impact and the unprecedented activity in Continental Europe, the 5th takeover wave of the 1990s and recent takeover activity (in biotech, utilities, pharmaceuticals) have triggered a great deal of interesting academic research. This volume brings together a selection of insightful papers. An impressive group of international authors address the following themes: takeover regulation; the cyclical pattern of the M&A markets and probable causes and effects; methods to determine the performance of success of M&A actions; cross border deals; means of payment and its effects; studies of hostile bids; high leverage takeovers and delistings.*A selection of the best and latest quantitative research on M&A activity worldwide*Impressive collection of international authors*Provides important insights and implications for practitioners","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance","Mergers and Acquisitions"]},{"id":"9781118944394","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"iPad For Seniors For Dummies, 7th Edition","authors":["Nancy C.

But he will also make clear that they do have a well thought-out plan for themselves, one that requires that every job they take build up their skill sets, so they become more valuable employees for someone else--if and when you do not fulfill your end of the bargain, or drag your feet in doing so.\n\nBut most of all, it will explain to corporate leaders that for this generation their personal life comes first, so that each job they take must accommodate itself to some need defined by their personal life. Tulgan argues that until you know the personal need the job can satisfy for a potential employee, you and the applicant may be talking past each other. Those needs are so beyond the imagination of most bosses that Tulgan devotes a third of the book to explaining how they affect the job decisions of this generation.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management"]},{"id":"9781604913491","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Leadership in Action: Collision Courses: When Social Identity Leads to Conflict","authors":["Patricia J.

Gans"],"pages":"8","publication_date":"April 2016","description":"Many business leaders are terrified by the word “disruption.” Over the past 20 years, Harvard Business School professor Clayton M. Christensen’s theory of disruptive innovation has led to widespread fear and paranoia among executives. For many, disruption is just around the corner, and the fear is palpable.\n\nSeveral academics have challenged the accuracy of Christensen’s theory — specifically, the extent to which disruptive innovations actually cause businesses in their path to fail. Author Joshua S. Gans concedes that disruption is a possibility, but he contends that the link between disruption and failure may not be as strong as many managers believe. In particular, Gans argues that disruption can be averted. “Many businesses find ways of managing through it, and this can weaken any relationship between a disruptive event and the actual disruption,” he writes.\n\nThe question, Gans says, is whether companies facing disruption are able to counter its effects. He describes three approaches to dealing with market entrants: beating them; joining them; and waiting them out.\n\nBeating Them: The first approach involves investing aggressively in new innovations after entrants bring them to market. Although Gans says managers may not know right away whether an entrant’s innovation will become a threat, when the situation becomes clear, they must act to protect their market position. He uses the example of Microsoft Corp., which introduced its Internet Explorer in the mid-1990s to compete against Netscape Navigator, which at the time was the dominant product in the browser market. Microsoft created a new division dedicated to defusing the Netscape threat.\n\nJoining Them: The idea here is for established businesses to “wait and see” whether a market entrant’s innovation improves and becomes a competitive threat. Then, instead of waging war, the existing player can acquire the entrant’s business and its products, thereby averting disruption. When disruption is upon them, Gans explains, incumbents realize they will face stiffer competition in the future, so they have an incentive to neutralize the threat. But there are also advantages to disrupters in avoiding a long period of intense competition with an established incumbent.\n\nWaiting Them Out: Gans suggests that established players should assess what they have that entrants lack -- entrants rarely have every element of a value chain. Indeed, he notes, sometimes incumbents are in positions of leadership precisely because they have invested in elements that are difficult to replicate. For example, in the printing industry, Mergenthaler, which pioneered the Linotype machine in the 1880s, also developed more than 1,000 typefaces, which established a high barrier for new entrants even as printing technology evolved. Under some circumstances, Gans writes, “incumbents may be able to afford to wait disruption out and react on their own timeline.”","tags":["Business","Economics","Next Economy"]},{"id":"9780071805971","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Microsoft® Word 2013 QuickSteps, 3rd Edition","authors":["Carole Matthews","Marty Matthews"],"pages":"288","publication_date":"April 2013","description":"Step-by-Step, Full-Color Graphics!\n\nGet up and running on Microsoft Word 2013 right away--the QuickSteps way.

This new emphasis is unlikely to generate stunning technological breakthroughs, but it allows Chinese competitors to reduce the time it takes to bring innovative products and services to mainstream markets. It also represents a different way of deploying Chinese cost and volume advantages in global competition. Chinese companies, including manufacturers such as Lenovo Group Ltd. and Guangzhou Pearl River Piano Group Co. Ltd. and Internet players such as Tencent Inc., are pioneering new ways of industrializing innovation. They are pushing the boundaries of simultaneous engineering, leveraging rapid “launch-test-improve” cycles and combining vertical hierarchy with horizontal flexibility to enhance the innovation process. For example, when Lenovo acquired IBM’s personal computer business in 2005, its new product development cycle was 12 to 18 months. Since then, Lenovo has managed to cut that cycle in half by applying simultaneous engineering across the entire innovation process. Other Chinese manufacturers, including Guangzhou Pearl River Piano Group, have applied a similar approach. Accelerated innovation and many of the processes and techniques it draws upon are not unique to Chinese companies, authors Peter J. Williamson and Eden Yin concede. What’s noteworthy, they say, is how Chinese companies have learned to accelerate innovation across a wide range of industries, using rapid scale-up, low cost and “good enough” quality. Even if the results don’t lead to breakthroughs, the innovations can powerfully disrupt incumbents’ profit models. The authors describe three ways that non-Chinese companies can respond effectively. The first way is for companies that are beyond the start-up phase to reengineer their own innovation processes in accordance with the principles and techniques of accelerated innovation being pioneered in China. The second way is to tap into China’s existing accelerated capabilities by tasking their own R&D units in China to focus on time-sensitive projects and by hiring local staff with knowledge of how to speed up certain aspects of the new product development cycle while reducing costs. The third approach is to develop alliances with Chinese players in order to tap into accelerated innovation know-how.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Innovation"]},{"id":"9781604914290","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Leadership in Action: Dispersed Teams Need to Get Off on the Right Foot","authors":["Valerie I.

In this article, the authors discuss the pressures on companies to disclose supply chain information, the drivers and impediments to such disclosure, and the types of supply chain information typically made available to the public. The article identifies the broad disclosure strategies companies can use to release supply chain information and offers managers guidance on designing the optimal disclosure strategy for their company. In addition to exploring the topic with examples from companies including Nike Inc., WD-40, and Patagonia Inc., the authors take a detailed look at how Apple’s approach to supply chain disclosure has evolved since 2009.\n\nIn considering how to manage supply chain information disclosure, the authors argue that managers must appreciate the diverse forces and actors driving and enabling this trend. Aside from internal governance and risk concerns, external pressure has come from government regulations, best practices of peers, changing expectations from salient stakeholder groups, and, of course, external events (such as the 2013 Rana Plaza garment factory collapse in Bangladesh).\n\nThe authors note that improving transparency can be expensive. The lack of standardized reporting systems, the absence of a common technology platform, ill-defined standards, and a lack of supplier education can also pose serious hindrances to companies wishing to improve their supply chain transparency.\n\nThe authors identify four common types of supply chain information that tends to be publicly disclosed: supply chain membership, provenance of materials, environmental information, and information on social impacts such as working conditions. Based on their research, they developed a transparency matrix to frame four typical supply chain disclosure strategies: transparent, secret, distracting, and withheld.\n\nThe authors say managers must understand the demands and respond in creative and meaningful ways without undermining the competitive advantage of their company. The tools and advice presented in the article can help managers navigate this complex and evolving area.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy"]},{"id":"9781604914689","language":"en","level":"Beginner","title":"Leadership in Action: Putting Some Life into Your Leadership","authors":["Marian N.

Hayashi"],"pages":"4","publication_date":"April 2013","description":"How can companies ensure that a promising initiative receives the necessary resources when the core business dominates the organization? And why do so many brilliant inventions fail while other seemingly mediocre offerings succeed? Such fundamental questions are addressed in two recent books by innovation scholars — Unrelenting Innovation: How to Build a Culture for Market Dominance, by Gerard J. Tellis (San Francisco, California: Jossey-Bass, 2013), and The Wide Lens: A New Strategy for Innovation, by Ron Adner (New York: Portfolio/Penguin, 2012). The two books make an interesting pairing: The first concentrates on a company’s internal workings, while the latter focuses on its external environment.In Unrelenting Innovation, Tellis asserts that the single most important driver of innovation in any organization is its culture, and he cites three organizational traits important for innovation: a willingness to cannibalize existing products, a risk-taking attitude and the ability to focus on the future. Those traits, he contends, are especially difficult to maintain in successful companies because of various human tendencies and biases. In particular, Tellis notes, many companies have a hard time commercializing radical innovations because these would hurt the company’s existing products. To counter such tendencies, Tellis offers three important practices: providing the right incentives, fostering internal markets and empowering “innovation champions” within the organization.The overarching theme of The Wide Lens is that many products do not succeed or fail by themselves. Instead, their fates are ultimately determined by the support they receive from external parties. “The light bulb on its own,” writes Adner, “was a miraculous invention but needed the development of the electric power network to turn it into a profitable innovation.” Because external support is crucial, executives need a very broad perspective — “the wide lens” in the book title — to ensure that their innovations become commercial successes. Adner is able to deconstruct a company’s external environment to look specifically at two types of important parties: those needed to develop complementary products or services (co-innovation) and those needed to adopt an innovation before the end customer can fully appreciate its value (the adoption chain).","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Innovation"]},{"id":"53863MIT55415","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Innovation Lessons From China","authors":["Troels Beltoft","Edward S.

They see unfair competitive practices, discriminatory regulation and intellectual property theft as part and parcel of the Chinese experience. Authors Edward S. Steinfeld and Troels Beltoft acknowledge that some of these concerns are valid. However, they focus on a different side of China, one that requires foreign companies to remain actively engaged. Their research describes unique forms of China-based technology innovation, mastery of which is becoming increasingly indispensible for any company aiming to succeed in the global market. The authors concede that China today may not yet be the place to go for path-breaking R&D or radical new invention. But it’s becoming the place to go if you want to learn how to make new ideas commercially viable. The authors provide detailed examples involving wind turbine manufacturing and semiconductor design. They group China-based knowledge into four categories: capabilities for rapid tempo operations and speed to market, accommodation of unique customer preferences, world-leading capabilities for cost reduction and capabilities for new forms of networked production. In China, the authors note, many people worry that their society’s focus on manufacturing has come at the expense of innovation. Conversely, many in the West believe that the migration of manufacturing to offshore locations has impeded their innovative capacity. But the authors say that both views miss the mark, noting that even the most groundbreaking ideas are devoid of commercial value unless they can be delivered as products in a manner, at a price point and within a period of time that suits the preferences of customers.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Innovation"]},{"id":"9781604914931","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Leadership in Action: Change and leadership Development: The Experience of Executive Women","authors":["Patricia J.

At worst, such advice can consist of little more than generic platitudes about “leveraging core competencies” or “synergies.”\n\nIncreasingly, the best sources of insight about strategy -- specifically, strategy for your company -- lie dormant within the company itself, in its employees. Ironically, companies often expend significant resources on external advice while employees with the best strategy ideas are ignored and thus may walk out the door.\n\nExamples illustrate that the mobility of employees -- whether they are fired or leave of their own volition -- can be seen as a leading indicator of the future prospects of a company.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Strategic Thinking"]},{"id":"9781604914702","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Leadership in Action: Dividends and Interest - Order on the Court: A Lesson in Leadership","authors":["Craig Chappelow"],"pages":"2","publication_date":"December 2000","description":"In these days of jargon-filled mission statements, it is refreshing to find an example of a leader walking the talk.","tags":["Business","Leadership and Management","Organizational Leadership"]},{"id":"9781604913118","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Leadership in Action: Stress and the Eye of the Beholder","authors":["Cynthia D.

Pierre Nanterme, chairman and CEO of the global professional services firm Accenture, recently sat down with MIT Sloan Management Review editor in chief Paul Michelman for a conversation about the challenges of digital transformation for Nanterme’s own organization, for leaders of the organizations he counsels, and for society.\n\nSo what do top executives need to do to steer their companies in the digital age? In Nanterme’s view, CEOs and other top executives don’t have to become technology experts themselves, but they do need to develop “a basic understanding of technology capabilities.” For one thing, he said, this understanding will enable executives to figure out new business models. For another, it will enable them to find ways to “massively rationalize” their operations using digital technologies.\n\nFor Accenture, Nanterme said, digitization has highlighted the importance of five capabilities: interactive, mobility, analytics, cloud, and security. Under his leadership, the $31 billion firm has transformed how it handles functions including finance, human resources, and communications “based on our belief that the digitization wave is the major disruption of our time.”\n\nNanterme pointed out that it has become “almost impossible” to predict things in the business world -- and that creates a need for agility. As things shift, he said, “there will be new technologies that shape, even transform, the business landscape, so we [CEOs] will need to execute multiple strategies -- or pathways -- in order to make sure we get where we want to go.”\n\nIn the future, Nanterme believes, management’s role will revolve less around evaluating people based on how well they meet numbers and more on the ability to lead in volatile and ambiguous environments. “We are at the end of a management cycle that has covered the past 50 years, and we are beginning to write a new book for the next 50,” he said. “There will be no long-term predictability. Leaders will need to learn to manage chaos and to do it in a highly disciplined way.”","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Digital Transformation"]},{"id":"9781604914924","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Leadership in Action: Executive Effectiveness and Fulfillment: A Leadership Factor","authors":["Robert J.

Sobek II"],"pages":"9","publication_date":"April 2016","description":"Managers often say they want to improve their product development capability based on so-called “lean” principles and practices so they can innovate while reducing costs and improving quality. In studying manufacturing over the past two decades, the authors have found that operational excellence is not achieved by simply applying lean practices to every process. More than anything, they say, it requires cultivating an aptitude and an expectation for continuous improvement within every employee.\n\nWhat’s important in product development, the authors say, isn’t just following the right steps -- it’s how the work is done. Until organizations fundamentally view people as central and leaders act accordingly, the risk of development process improvement efforts not actually improving anything is frighteningly high. In practice, the authors contend, most companies invest very little in people development in comparison to other investments they make.\n\nThe underlying concepts of lean product development have been around since the 1980s, the authors note, when an MIT study found that Japanese automotive companies followed practices that were profoundly different from those of other auto manufacturers.\n\nIn new product development, lean is about advancing the skills of individuals through technical training and methods of collaboration so that each developer is able to design, develop, and deliver better products and services. Companies can promote individual mastery, in the authors’ view, by asking three questions: (1) What do we need to learn about our customers, products, and production processes to design better products? (2) How do we learn this? (3) And what kinds of organizational structures and routines will best support learning?\n\nThe authors outline several steps companies should take to advance the development of their people. These include making technical mastery an expectation and building it into the reward system and how people work every day, and developing standards and using them. The starting point for standards can be the knowledge that already resides within the organization; standards can be systematically updated based on the learning gained on each development project. In addition, companies should hold regular technical design reviews with the explicit aim of developing their people, and they should take a critical look at the formal development process. Finally, executives should ask their leadership teams to focus less on decision making and assigning work, and more on instructing and improving.","tags":["Business","Business Strategy","Innovation"]},{"id":"9781604914788","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Leadership in Action: Inklings - Twenty-Five Years - Seemingly Quick as a Heartbeat","authors":["David P.

The CEO and executive team are almost always highly compensated and the relative total compensation has mushroomed over time. Most of the compensation now is designed to be performance-based, but leading to charges that executives have incentives to manipulate corporate earnings and stock price in the short-term for their own self interests. The compensation at some companies became so egregious that compensation again became a major public policy issue subject to federal regulation. Executive Compensation focuses on the major topics related to executive compensation—present, past, and future. First, is understanding what executive compensation is, including composition and objectives of pay contracts. Second, how do specific compensation agreements affect corporate behavior and performance? Third, what are the major components, including how and what are accounted for and disclosed? How is compensation, especially executive compensation, accounted for—that is, what are the calculations and journal entries required? Fourth, what does historical analysis tell us about the topic, especially how contractual decisions have been made and what has worked.

But whether we are leading or following, what matters most is we get to the truth. We have to develop a commitment to sharing vital facts and identifying faulty assumptions—it can mean the difference between success and failure. This is why we need Humble Inquiry more than ever. The Scheins define Humble Inquiry as “the gentle art of drawing someone out, of asking questions to which you do not know the answer, of building relationships based on curiosity and interest in the other person.” It was inspired by Edgar's twenty years of work in high-hazard industries and the health-care system, where honest communication can literally mean the difference between life and death.In this new edition the authors look at how Humble Inquiry differs from other kinds of inquiry, offer examples of it in action, and show how to overcome the barriers that keep us telling when we should be asking. This edition offers a deepening and broadening of this concept, seeing it as not just a way of posing questions but an entire attitude that includes better listening, better responding to what others are trying to tell us, and better revealing of ourselves. Packed with case examples and a full chapter of exercises and simulations, this is a major contribution to how we see human conversational dynamics and relationships, presented in a compact, personal, and eminently practical way.","tags":["Business","Soft Skills","Professional Development"]},{"id":"9780470916803","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Information Technology for Management: Improving Strategic and Operational Performance, 8th Edition","authors":["Efraim Turban","Linda Volonino"],"pages":"star rating fill","publication_date":"January 2011","description":"Up-to-date coverage on how new technology is changing the way organizations operate and compete\n\nEvery day, new technology influences how organizations operate and compete in the current global environment, and this updated edition of a classic provides authoritative and streamlined coverage of this evolving topic.

Boudreault and Renaud answer the need for a clear, application-oriented guide to the growing field of actuarial finance with this volume, which focuses on the mathematical models and techniques used in actuarial finance for the pricing and hedging of actuarial liabilities exposed to financial markets and other contingencies. With roots in modern financial mathematics, actuarial finance presents unique challenges due to the long-term nature of insurance liabilities, the presence of mortality or other contingencies and the structure and regulations of the insurance and pension markets.\n\nMotivated, designed and written for and by actuaries, this book puts actuarial applications at the forefront in addition to balancing mathematics and finance at an adequate level to actuarial undergraduates. While the classical theory of financial mathematics is discussed, the authors provide a thorough grounding in such crucial topics as recognizing embedded options in actuarial liabilities, adequately quantifying and pricing liabilities, and using derivatives and other assets to manage actuarial and financial risks.\n\nActuarial applications are emphasized and illustrated with about 300 examples and 200 exercises. The book also comprises end-of-chapter point-form summaries to help the reader review the most important concepts. Additional topics and features include:\n\nCompares pricing in insurance and financial markets\nDiscusses event-triggered derivatives such as weather, catastrophe and longevity derivatives and how they can be used for risk management;\nIntroduces equity-linked insurance and annuities (EIAs, VAs), relates them to common derivatives and how to manage mortality for these products\nIntroduces pricing and replication in incomplete markets and analyze the impact of market incompleteness on insurance and risk management;\nPresents immunization techniques alongside Greeks-based hedging;\nCovers in detail how to delta-gamma/rho/vega hedge a liability and how to rebalance periodically a hedging portfolio.\n\nThis text will prove itself a firm foundation for undergraduate courses in financial mathematics or economics, actuarial mathematics or derivative markets. It is also highly applicable to current and future actuaries preparing for the exams or actuary professionals looking for a valuable addition to their reference shelf. \n\nAs of 2019, the book covers significant parts of the Society of Actuaries’ Exams FM, IFM and QFI Core, and the Casualty Actuarial Society’s Exams 2 and 3F. It is assumed the reader has basic skills in calculus (differentiation and integration of functions), probability (at the level of the Society of Actuaries’ Exam P), interest theory (time value of money) and, ideally, a basic understanding of elementary stochastic processes such as random walks.","tags":["Business","Finance & Accounting","Finance"]},{"id":"9781118319253","language":"en","level":"Intermediate to advanced","title":"Contract Negotiation Handbook: Getting the Most Out of Commercial Deals","authors":["Damian Ward"],"pages":"304","publication_date":"September 2011","description":"A good commercial contract is both a springboard and a safety net -- it provides the opportunity to expand and grow your business, but also to protect it if things go wrong.

To stay relevant, we have to be able to excel cognitively, behaviorally, and emotionally in ways that technology can't.Professor Ed Hess believes that requires us to become Hyper-Learners: continuously learning, unlearning, and relearning at the speed of change. To do that, we have to overcome our reflexive ways of being: seeking confirmation of what we believe, emotionally defending our beliefs and our ego, and seeking cohesiveness of our mental models. Hyper-Learning requires a new way of being and a radical new way of working. In Part 1 of this how-to book, Hess takes a practical workbook approach and helps readers create their Hyper-Learning Mindset, choose and embrace their needed Hyper-Learning Behaviors, and adopt their daily Hyper-Learning Practices. In Part 2, Hess focuses on how to humanize the workplace to optimize Hyper-Learning.
